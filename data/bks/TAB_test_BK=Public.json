{"001-61807": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF YALMAN AND OTHERS v. TURKEY\n(Application no. 36110/97)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n3 June 2004\nFINAL\n03/09/2004\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Yalman and Others v. Turkey,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (First Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr P. Lorenzen, President,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr R. T\u00fcrmen,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMrs N. Vaji\u0107,\nMrs S. Botoucharova,\nMrs E. Steiner, judges,\nand Mr S. Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 15 May 2003 and on 13 May 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained that the proceedings on compensation had not been concluded within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they had lasted almost seven years. The relevant parts of Article 6 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...\u201d\n20. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the \u201creasonable length\u201d requirement laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 began on 2 and 6 March 1989 for Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy and Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan respectively, on 10 April 1989 for Mr Yusuf \u00c7am\u00e7a and on 1 June 1989 for Mr Galip Yalman. They ended on 30 May 1996 when the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 second appeal. The period under consideration thus lasted approximately seven years.\n21. The Government submitted that in order to decide on the compensation issue the Sinop Assize Court had to request the case files from the courts which had decided on the applicants\u2019 detention on remand. They further maintained that the applicants\u2019 case had involved several appeal stages. They referred in this connection to the case-law of the Court which establishes that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings depends, among other things, on the particular circumstances of the case (Konig v. Germany, judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, \u00a7 99, and Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 139, \u00a7 59). They concluded that bearing in mind the number of documents which had to be requested from other courts and the several appeal stages involved, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.\n22. The applicants contended that the need to obtain evidence from other courts was not sufficient to justify the length of the proceedings. They maintained that requesting documents or case-files from other courts was a common occurrence in court proceedings. If this procedure caused a delay in the proceedings, it had to be concluded that there had been a serious problem in the trial system.\n23. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among others, Sekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 26518/95, \u00a7 35, 22 January 2004, and Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, \u00a7 33, 17 February 2004).\n24. The Court considers that the subject matter of the litigation, namely the determination of the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicants for their unjustified detention on remand, was not particularly complex. It further notes that the cases concerning compensation claims brought under Law no. 466 are examined by the competent courts by way of a written procedure.\n25. As regards the conduct of the applicants, the Court observes that it does not appear that they significantly contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n26. As to the conduct of the authorities, the Court observes that the first instance court took more than four years to render its judgment and that this delay has not been satisfactorily explained by the Government. Their argument concerning the number of documents which had to be requested from other courts is not sufficient to explain the delay in question. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see, among other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France, judgment of 25 March 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-II, \u00a7 74). The Court further considers that the delay in the appeal proceedings is also attributable to the national authorities in the light of the above-cited principle.\n27. In the light of the criteria laid down in its case-law and taking into account the overall duration of the proceedings, the Court finds that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not complied with in the present case.\n28. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n30. The applicants claimed a total of 10,000 euros (EUR) for pecuniary damage. They alleged that if the non-pecuniary compensation was paid at an earlier stage than 1996 they would not have a loss due to inflation. This sum also included the applicants\u2019 loss of income throughout the duration of the proceedings.\n31. The Government contested the applicants\u2019 claims. They submitted that the amounts claimed by the applicants were excessive.\n32. The Court considers that there is no causal link between the pecuniary damage claimed before the Court and the violation found. The Court notes in this connection that the compensation awarded was of non\u2011pecuniary nature and that the amount awarded was within the discretion of the domestic court. Moreover, it is not for the Court to speculate on what the outcome of the proceedings would be if they were in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Werner v. Austria, judgment of 24 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2514, \u00a7 72). Consequently, no award is made under this head.\n33. The applicants further claimed a total of EUR 50,000 for non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n34. The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient reparation.\n35. The Court accepts that the applicants suffered non\u2011pecuniary damage such as distress and frustration on account of the duration of the proceedings, which cannot be sufficiently compensated by finding of a violation. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and having regard to its jurisprudence (see Sekin and Others cited above, \u00a7 45), the Court awards the applicants a total sum of EUR 5,000.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n36. The applicants claimed a total of EUR 3,100 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the domestic authorities and before the Strasbourg institutions.\n37. The Government did not make any submission on this claim.\n38. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants the sum of EUR 2,500 in respect of costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n39. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts:\n(i) EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(ii) EUR 2,500 (two thousand and five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 June 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS\u00f8ren Nielsen Peer Lorenzen\nRegistrar President", "001-61253": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF PRICE and LOWE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Applications nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n29 July 2003\nFINAL\n03/12/2003\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr V. Butkevych,\nMrs W. Thomassen, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 September 2002 and 8 July 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicants allege a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in connection with the length of the proceedings at issue. Article 6 provides, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n18. The proceedings began on 12 February 1986 when K issued a writ against the applicants and Mrs Price. They ended on 30 March 1998 when leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the House of Lords. They thus lasted a total of 12 years, one month and 18 days.\n19. The Government contend that the length of the proceedings before the setting down of the case for trial in 1994 was attributable wholly to the conduct of the parties, and that it was for the parties to apply for an appropriate direction if they had perceived it to be in their interests to do so. After the case had been set down, the case was dealt with by three instances between August 1994 and March 1998, and the only periods of delay for which the authorities were responsible were: one month when the commencement of the trial was adjourned; the six months\u2019 period before the Court of Appeal heard the case, during which time arrangements for the hearing were made, and the four months\u2019 period for delivery of the House of Lords\u2019 decision, during which period the judicial members of the House examined the complaints and the supporting material.\n20. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000-IV, \u00a7 19; Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, ECHR 2001-VIII, \u00a7 52).\n21. Once the case had been set down for trial, the case proceeded through three levels of jurisdiction in a little over three and a half years, notwithstanding the complicating factors that the plaintiff had been declared bankrupt and the property at issue was out of the jurisdiction. The Court is aware that some discussion between the parties may be necessary in civil proceedings to clarify the disputed issues, but considers that that period of three and a half years could have been considered a \u201creasonable time\u201d in this case.\n22. However, the question is whether the Government can be held responsible for the period preceding the trial of the action, even though the parties knew, or should have known, that the High Court would not act of its own motion. The Government refer, in this respect, to the case of Union Alimentaria Sanders v. Spain (judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 157, \u00a7 35).\n23. The Court has held on a number of occasions that a principle of domestic law or practice that the parties to civil proceedings are required to take the initiative with regard to the progress of the proceedings, does not dispense the State from complying with the requirement to deal with cases in a reasonable time (see Buchholz v Germany judgment of 6 May 1981, Series no. 42, p. 16, \u00a7 50; Guincho v. Portugal judgment of 10 July 1984, Series A no. 81, p. 14, \u00a7 32; Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, p. 11, \u00a7 25; Mitchell and Holloway v. the United Kingdom, no. 44808/98, judgment of 17 December 2002). The manner in which a State provides for mechanisms to comply with this requirement \u2013 whether by way of increasing the numbers of judges, or by automatic time-limits and directions, or by some other method \u2013 is for the State to decide. If a State lets proceedings continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay.\n24. In the light of the preceding comments, and even though the applicants did not put the matter of the length of the pre-trial proceedings to the High Court, the Court finds that the proceedings in the present case were not dealt with within a \u201creasonable time\u201d, as required by Article 6 of the Convention.\n25. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n##### 2. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. Dr Price claimed pecuniary damage under a number of heads, including the sums paid to his domestic lawyers in connection with the purchase of the property, amounting to \u00a3346,885 on 30 December 2002, plus interest on his share of that figure. He also claimed secretarial costs of \u00a39,875, printer\u2019s costs of \u00a31,886.28, transport costs of \u00a31,400 and loss of earnings of about \u00a3300,000\n28. Dr Price next claimed non-pecuniary damage of \u00a3200 per week, making a total of \u00a3197,200 up to December 2002, and exemplary damages.\n29. Mrs Lowe claimed pecuniary damage of \u00a3232,093.44 in respect of money held by domestic lawyers, \u00a361,892.65 in respect of money paid in eviction proceedings in 2002, \u00a32,210 in respect of travel costs, and some \u00a31,800 in respect of costs in dealing with bankruptcy proceedings.\n30. She also claimed non-pecuniary damage of \u00a398,600 up to December 2002, and exemplary damages of, she suggested, \u00a3100,000.\n31. The Government noted that the admissible complaint in the present case related to the length of the proceedings only, and contended that much of the material submitted was irrelevant. They added that, as the applicants remained in possession of the properties throughout, the length of the proceedings was, with hindsight, to the applicants\u2019 benefit. Further, they underlined that the blame for the principal delay could not be laid at the door of the authorities, and that it had been open to the applicants to reduce that delay, but they chose not to. The Government considered that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction.\n32. As to the applicants\u2019 claims for pecuniary loss, the Court recalls that there must be a clear causal connection between the damage claimed by the applicant and the violation of the Convention (see, amongst other authorities, the Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain judgment of 13 June 1994 (Article 50), Series A no. 285-C, pp. 57-58, \u00a7\u00a7 16-20; the Cak\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey judgment of 8 July 1999, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1999-IV, \u00a7 127). The Court finds no such causal connection in the present case between the heads of loss claimed and the unreasonable length of proceedings found to disclose a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n33. Turning to non-pecuniary loss, the Court does not find it substantiated that the applicants suffered, as a result of the breach in this case, any concrete injury to health, family life or career. Whilst Dr Price\u2019s career has met with certain difficulties over the period of the proceedings and, since it is not possible to determine to what extent, if at all, those difficulties were due to the unreasonable length of the proceedings. The Court notes, and this is not affected by the Court\u2019s above finding that the State may not leave responsibility for compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 to the parties, that it would have been open to the applicants to apply to the High Court for matters to be expedited in the period before the case was set down for trial, but that they chose not to. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicants the sum of 1,000 euros (EUR) each under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n34. The applicants claimed costs and expenses. Mrs Lowe, in particular, referred to a solicitors\u2019 bill which had not been received on 30 December 2002.\n35. The Government did not comment specifically on the claim for costs and expenses.\n36. The applicants were not represented in the proceedings before the Court, although they have had the benefit of advice from domestic solicitors at the post-admissibility stage. Much of the material submitted by Dr Price has concerned matters beyond the scope of the case. Bearing in mind that amounts claimed by the applicant must be necessarily incurred and reasonable as to quantum (see, amongst other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II), the Court awards the applicants the sum of EUR 500 each for legal costs and expenses, inclusive of VAT, this sum to be converted to pounds sterling at the date of settlement.\n#### C. Default interest\n37. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds unanimously that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds by four votes to three that the respondent State is to pay each applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into pounds sterling at the date of settlement;\n3. Holds unanimously that the respondent State is to pay each applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into pounds sterling at the date of settlement;\n4. Holds unanimously that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 29 July 2003, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS. Doll\u00e9 J.-P. Costa\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the partly dissenting opinion of Sir Nicolas Bratza, Mr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson and Mrs Thomassen is annexed to this judgment.\n#### J.-P.C.\nS. D.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES Sir Nicolas BRATZA, GAUKUR J\u00d6RUNDSSON\nAND WILHELMINA THOMASSEN\nWhile we agree that there has been a violation of Article 6 paragraph 1 of the Convention by reason of the length of the proceedings in which the applicants were involved and while we accept that the applicants should be awarded EUR 500 each in respect of legal costs and expenses, we are unable to share the view of the majority of the Chamber that the applicants should also be awarded EUR 1,000 each in respect of non-pecuniary damage. In our view, the circumstances of the present case are such that the finding of a violation should itself amount to sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non-pecuniary damage suffered.\nWe recall in this regard that Article 41 requires the Court to afford just satisfaction to the injured party only \u201cif necessary\u201d. The question whether such an award is necessary depends on the circumstances of the individual case. Although it has in recent years been the normal practice of the Court to award compensation where a complaint concerning the length of proceedings has been upheld, such an award should never in our view automatically follow from such a finding. The Court must in principle be satisfied that the unjustified delay in the case has given rise to moral damage, whether in the form of damage to health, anxiety, distress, frustration or otherwise, and that, in all the circumstances, an award of compensation is called for.\nWe are not satisfied that this is so in the present case. In this regard, we note that the Court has found the applicants\u2019 claim to have suffered injury to health , family life or career in consequence of the length of the proceedings to be unsubstantiated (paragraph 33 of the judgment). We would in addition observe that the applicants were the defendants in the proceedings brought by K, in which he claimed to rescind the contract of sale to the applicants of his property in Florida. K\u2019s claim was upheld by the domestic courts on the ground that the applicants had been unable to rebut the presumption of undue influence created by the discrepancy in the price they had paid K for the property and its value at the time of transfer and by the doctor-patient relationship between the first applicant and K. It is moreover clear from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the first applicant had enjoyed possession of the property in dispute during the course of the proceedings and had been in receipt of rents from the letting of the property since the date of completion of the sale, subject only to the agreement to allow K to use part of it in the early months following the sale. As is further pointed out in the judgment, the applicants took no steps to apply to the court to expedite the proceedings, although it was open to them to do so if they considered that insufficient progress was being made. While, for the reasons given in paragraph 23 of the judgment, such a failure cannot affect\nthe responsibility of the respondent State under Article 6 of the Convention to secure that legal proceedings do not exceed a reasonable time, it remains in our view a material factor in determining what, if any, award in respect of non-pecuniary damage should be made under Article 41 of the Convention. In our view, no such award was justified in the present case.", "001-66929": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MEHMET B\u00dcLENT YILMAZ AND \u015eAH\u0130N YILMAZ v.

Greve,\nMr K. Traja,\nMrs A. Gyulumyan, judges,\nand Mr V. Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n12. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. The applicants complained in the first place that they had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Izmir State Security Court. They further alleged that the national courts had convicted them on the basis of the statements that they had made to the police and to the investigating judge. The applicants finally maintained that they had been deprived of their right to defend themselves by a lawyer. In this connection, they invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n14. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicants\u2019 complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Izmir State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicants were complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, they should have lodged their application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 25 March 1997.\n15. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six-month rule in the past and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003, and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instance case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n16. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n17. In the light of its established case law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Izmir State Security Court\n18. The Government maintained that the state security courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicants could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Izmir State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on state security courts.\n19. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36).\n20. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicants who were prosecuted in a State Security Court for being a member of an illegal organisation and for aiding and abetting an armed gang respectively should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, they could legitimately fear that the Izmir State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicants\u2019 fears as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n21. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. As to the remainder of the complaints submitted under Article 6\n22. Having regard to its finding that the applicants\u2019 right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicants\u2019 remaining complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n24. The applicants requested the Court to award 4,000 euros (EUR) to the first applicant and EUR 5,000 to the second applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n25. The Government requested the refusal of the applicants\u2019 claims.\n26. The Court further considers that the finding of a violation of Article 6 constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants in this respect (see Incal, cited above, p. 1575, \u00a7 82, and \u00c7iraklar v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n27. Where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted by a tribunal which is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant is granted in due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n28. The applicants also claimed EUR 5,000 for the costs and expenses\n29. The Government did not make any comments on this point.\n30. The Court will make an award in respect of costs and expenses in so far as these were actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum (see, for example, Sawicka v. Poland, no. 37645/97, \u00a7 54, 1 October 2002).\n31. Making its own estimate based on the information available, and having regard to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among other authorities, \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7 49, and Aksa\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 41956/98, \u00a7 31, 15 July 2004), the Court awards the applicants in respect of costs and expenses EUR 3,000, less EUR 685 received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.\n#### C. Default interest\n32. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint relating to the independence and impartiality of the Izmir State Security Court;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine the remaining complaints submitted under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), less EUR 685 received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe, in respect of costs and expenses to be converted into Turkish Liras at the rate applicable at the date of the settlement and free of any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 October 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nVincent Berger Georg Ress\nRegistrar President", "001-159913": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PRUS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime are set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Piechowicz v. Poland (no. 20071/07, \u00a7\u00a7 110-17, 17 April 2012), and Horych v. Poland (no. 13621/08, \u00a7\u00a7 49-56, 17 April 2012).\n16. The provisions of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences concerning the imposition of the regime on convicted persons read as follows:\nArticle 88 \u00a7 3\n\u201cA convicted person posing a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison shall be placed in a prison with a closed regime in conditions ensuring increased protection of society and the security of the prison.\u201d\nArticle 88a\n\u201c1. The convicted person referred to in Article 88 \u00a7 3 shall be placed in a designated wing or in a cell of a prison with a closed regime. A penitentiary judge shall be informed about this placement.\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 above shall be applied to a convicted person whose characteristics, personal circumstances, motivations, behaviour when committing the offence, type of offence and its consequences, behaviour in prison, or degree of depravity pose a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison, and who:\n(2a) during the prior or current term of imprisonment posed a danger to the security of a prison or a remand centre in that he was a leader or an active participant in a collective remonstrance in a prison or a remand centre ...\u201d\n17. Article 88b of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences lays down specific arrangements applicable to convicted persons to whom the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime is applied. They are identical to those specified in Article 212b of the Code applicable to persons remanded in custody (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 106).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that he had been unlawfully classified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and subjected to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n19. The Government contested that allegation.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that the prolonged imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime had been in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In his opinion, there had been no reasonable grounds for applying the regime to him. He contested the allegation that he had been the leader of a collective protest. He had never been charged with or convicted of such an act. He admitted to having refused, on one occasion, to eat his breakfast while at the Opole Lubelskie Prison.\n22. The applicant submitted that he had been held mostly in solitary confinement. He referred to the prolonged and excessive isolation from his family, the outside world and other detainees, and to other restrictions, such as wearing \u201cjoined shackles\u201d, routine strip searches to which he had been subjected on a daily basis and, lastly, monitoring of his cell (including the sanitary facilities) via closed\u2011circuit television. The applicant stressed that all of his movements in the cell had been constantly monitored. The images had been recorded and stored for at least seven days. Every time he left or entered his cell, usually several times a day, he had been subjected to a degrading, exceptionally intrusive body search by at least three prison guards. Other inmates were often present during the strip search. Moreover, every time the applicant left his cell he was escorted and accompanied by guards, who were present also during medical examinations.\n##### 2. The Government\n23. The Government stressed that in the present case the treatment complained of had not attained the minimum level of severity required for a breach of Article 3.\n24. The Government maintained that the applicant had been classified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d in accordance with the relevant legal provisions. He had planned and led a collective protest in the Opole Lubelskie Prison \u2013 the prisoners\u2019 hunger strike. Moreover, the domestic authority considered that the applicant had been demoralised and had had a negative influence on other detainees.\n25. The application of \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d status to the applicant had been reviewed after three months. As soon as the commission noticed an improvement in the applicant\u2019s attitude \u2013 on 28 April 2011, after five months and twenty-three days \u2013 it lifted the regime. In those circumstances, the Government considered that subjecting the applicant to the regime had been legitimate and necessary for preventing a risk of disturbance in the prison and maintaining prison security.\n26. The Government stressed that the regime had been imposed on the applicant for a very short period of time during which he had been provided with adequate stimulation and human contact. In particular, twice a week he had the right to visit a library and a room equipped with a computer, a television and other means of entertainment. He was also entitled to receive visits. The Government concluded that the treatment to which he had been subjected had not been incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. They invited the Court to find no violation of that provision.\n##### 3. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) General principles deriving from the Court\u2019s case-law\n27. The relevant general principles deriving from its case-law were recently summarised in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Piechowicz v. Poland (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 158-65) and Horych v. Poland (Horych, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85-92).\n(b) Application of the above principles in the present case\n28. The Court notes that there is no dispute over the fact that from 5 November 2010 to 28 April 2011, that is, for five months and twenty-three days, the applicant was classified as a so\u2011called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and, in consequence, subjected to high\u2011security measures and various restrictions (see paragraphs 7-14 above). The main aspects of the regime raised by the applicant and specified below were not contested by the Government (see paragraphs 22 - 26 above). The details of the core aspects of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime were also extensively analysed in the Piechowicz judgment (cited above, \u00a7 166 with further references).\n29. The measures applied in the applicant\u2019s case comprised confinement in a special high-security prison wing and increased supervision of his movements within and outside the cell, which meant that he had to wear so\u2011called \u201cjoined shackles\u201d (handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains) whenever he was taken outside his cell. The measures involved his segregation from the prison community and restrictions on contact with his family. In addition, every time he left or entered his cell he was routinely subjected to a \u201cfull strip search\u201d \u2013 a thorough inspection of his body and clothes in which he was required to strip naked and make deep knee bends in order to enable an examination of his anus (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant submitted that the strip searches had been conducted in the corridor outside his cell and that other inmates had been able to see him. In addition, his cell, including the sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via closed-circuit television.\nThe Government did not contest those allegations. They underlined that the applicant had had access to facilities in the prison such as a library and an entertainment room. Moreover, they submitted that he had had the right to receive family visits, without specifying whether any visits had taken place during the period in question (see paragraph 26 above).\n30. The parties disagreed on whether the adverse consequences of the imposition of the above measures on the applicant had been serious enough to attain the minimum level of severity required for a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n31. The Court firstly notes that the facts of the instant case differ from the leading cases of Piechowicz and Horych, where the dangerous detainee regime was imposed on the basis of Article 212a \u00a7 3 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, which sets out strict, rigid rules for the imposition of the special regime in cases where the charges against the detainee are of a serious nature (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 105 and 177).\n32. In the present case the authorities justified their decision of 5 November 2010 imposing the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime on the applicant on account of the applicant\u2019s alleged participation in a planned collective remonstrance in the prison. The legal basis for the imposition of the regime was Article 88a \u00a7 2 (2a) of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (see paragraphs 7 and 16 above). The applicant explained that the prisoners, including himself, had refused to eat their breakfast. He denied his alleged leadership of any disturbances in the prison. He does not appear to have been convicted of a violent offence or linked with organised crime (contrast Horych, cited above, \u00a7 94). Nor does he appear to have received any disciplinary punishment for those events or to have been charged by the prosecutor.\nIn those circumstances the Court is not convinced that it was reasonable on the part of the authorities to consider that, for the sake of ensuring prison security, the applicant should be indiscriminately subjected to the full range of measures that were available to them under the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime.\n33. The Court notes that the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime was applied to the applicant for a total of five months and twenty-three days. Although it appears that at times the applicant was held in a solitary cell at a special high-security wing separated from the rest of the prison, he was not subjected to complete sensory and social isolation. The Government underlined that he had had the right to visit a library and other facilities in the prison and to receive family visits. There is no evidence that the applicant in reality benefited from any mental or physical stimulation, with the exception of a daily and solitary walk within the segregated area.\n34. In the Piechowicz case the Court did not accept that the continued, routine and indiscriminate application of the full range of measures that was available to the authorities under the so-called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime had been necessary in order to maintain prison security, or that their application was compatible with Article 3 of the Convention (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 170). Also in the present case, the Court is not convinced that shackling the applicant was necessary on each and every occasion (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 174).\n35. The Court has even more misgivings with regard to the full body search to which the applicant was likewise subjected daily, or even several times a day, whenever he left or entered his cell. Strip searches were carried out as a matter of routine and were not linked to any specific security needs, or to any specific suspicion concerning the applicant\u2019s conduct.\nThe Court has already stated in the Piechowicz case that while strip searches might be necessary to ensure prison security or to prevent disorder or crime, it was not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that such systematic, intrusive and exceptionally embarrassing checks performed daily, or even several times a day, were necessary to ensure safety in the prison (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 176).\n36. Given that the applicant was already being subjected to several other strict surveillance measures and that the authorities did not rely on any specific or convincing security requirements, the Court considers that the practice of daily strip searches applied to him for almost six months must have caused him feelings of inferiority, anguish and accumulated distress which went beyond the unavoidable suffering and humiliation involved in the execution of his prison sentence (see Horych, cited above, \u00a7 101, and Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 175 and 176).\n37. Lastly, the Court notes that in extending the regime on 3 February 2011, the commission gave no reason apart from the original one given three months earlier. This lack of a new justification for extending the regime was criticised by the Szczecin District Court, which quashed the decision of 6 December 2011 and ordered the commission to re-examine the matter (see paragraph 14 above). The Court has already noticed that the authorities, in extending that regime, were not in fact obliged to consider any changes in the applicant\u2019s personal situation and, in particular, the combined effects of the continued application of the impugned measures (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 177).\nThe Court considers that also in the instant case the authorities failed to sufficiently justify the extension of the regime and that the procedure for review of the applicant\u2019s \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d status was a pure formality, limited to a repetition of the same grounds.\n38. In conclusion, taking into account the cumulative effects of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime on the applicant, the Court finds that the authorities did not provide sufficient and relevant reasons which could justify, in the circumstances of the case, the severity of the measures taken. In particular, the authorities failed to show that the impugned measures were necessary in their entirety to attain the legitimate aim of ensuring prison security.\n39. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n40. The applicant complained of a violation of Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention. He complained about the manner in which the penitentiary commission had applied and extended the regime, and the alleged ineffectiveness of his appeals against the commission\u2019s decisions.\n41. The Government contested that argument.\n42. The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.\n43. The Court observes that at the heart of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention lies not only the prolonged imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime but also the procedure for reviewing his status (see paragraph 37 above). These issues have been examined and have resulted in the finding of a violation of that provision (see paragraph 38 above). In the circumstances, the Court considers that no separate issue arises under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention and makes no separate finding.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n45. The applicant claimed 9,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n46. The Government considered the claim excessive.\n47. The Court awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n48. The applicant, who received legal aid from the Council of Europe in connection with the presentation of his case, did not make any claim for costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n49. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 January 2016, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3\nRegistrar President", "001-61227": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MELLORS v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant complained of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in his trial and appeal. Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n25. The applicant was arrested on the rape charge on 30 October 1995 and his appeal was finally rejected on 22 July 1999. The criminal proceedings lasted three years, eight months and twenty three days.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n26. The applicant submitted that the case was not particularly complex. After conviction, his lawyers were not informed of the failure to cite the witness W. for some time and any delay or complication arising from that derived from the trial Advocate Depute's improper conduct in the first place. Thereafter, there was delay due to lack of availability of the Advocate Depute and the lack of time allocated in the appeal court. He did not refuse to go to the first listed appeal hearing; the prison unjustifiably preventing him from attending in civilian clothing. He claimed that there was no explanation for the delay of eight and a half months between the taking of W.'s evidence and the appeal hearing.\n27. The Government submitted that the period taken from 30 October 1995 to 22 July 1999 was reasonable in all the circumstances. The trial proceedings were complex and there were difficulties in obtaining samples from the applicant for forensic analysis. The appeal proceedings were also complex. Additional grounds of appeal were lodged and as a result the appeal court required to hear evidence, which had to be transcribed and reported upon. The appeal then had to be heard afresh on its merits. The applicant's conduct had contributed to the time taken, namely his refusal to come to court on 20 December 1996, the withdrawal of his counsel at the hearing set for 20 August 1998 and the request for adjournment of the appeal listed for January 1999. Any instances of delay by the authorities were minimal and were for justifiable reasons.\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court's case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n29. The importance of what was at stake for the applicant, a serious criminal conviction and a sentence of imprisonment, is not in doubt.\n30. As regards the complexity of the proceedings, these involved forensic investigation prior to the trial and on appeal, complications arose when the applicant's' representatives raised new grounds of appeal in light of their discovery of events at trial concerning the witness W. It cannot be considered however that the proceedings presented any exceptional problems or difficulty.\n31. Taking the period to the applicant's conviction on 2 July 1996, the Court observes that this occurred slightly more than eight months after the applicant was first questioned. This does not disclose any undue delay.\n32. The appeal proceedings are more problematic, accounting for three years and two weeks of the overall period. The applicant lodged his intention to appeal promptly on 8 July 1996 but it was not for over another three years that the appeal was determined. This is, on the face of it, a long period for one instance of appeal.\n33. The Government have argued that the applicant was responsible for part of the delay. While it appears however that the applicant failed to attend the first listing of his appeal on 20 December 1996, this was due to the refusal of the prison to allow him to leave in the civilian clothing which he was entitled to wear at his hearing. The following two adjournments cannot be regarded as attributable to the applicant, a hearing in May 1997 being vacated due to the absence abroad of the Advocate Depute for the Crown and a further hearing in October 1997 being adjourned due to pressure of business on the court itself. These last two adjournments resulted in a delay of over a year.\n34. When the case came to be heard on 13-14 January 1998, the applicant's representative introduced new grounds of appeal relating to the witness W. This, as the Government pointed out, inevitably lengthened the appeal proceedings further. Nonetheless, the appeal court partially upheld these complaints and the applicant cannot be regarded as automatically responsible for any delay that followed, it being incumbent on the judicial authorities to examine any new grounds of appeal with appropriate expedition.\n35. The decision was taken relatively quickly, on 13 February 1998, in response to the new grounds of appeal, to call the witness W. to give evidence. The applicant's counsel withdrew at the last moment from the initial hearing of evidence fixed in August 1998 and the lapse of time that followed until W. was heard on 16 October 1998 cannot be entirely attributed to the authorities. Lord Philip's note of evidence was drawn up on 20 November 1998. While the Government pointed out that the applicant's solicitors applied to adjourn the appeal hearing listed to follow on 8 January 1999, due to unavailability of counsel in that week, this does not explain why there was in fact a lapse of another five months before the case came back for its final hearing on 24 June 1999.\n36. Having regard therefore to overall length of time taken on the appeal, and taking into account the lapse of time in bringing the appeal on for hearing and in relisting the case after the hearing of the witness, W., the Court considers that the appeal did not proceed with the necessary expedition and failed to satisfy the reasonable time requirement. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Non-pecuniary damage\n38. The applicant submitted that he had been in custody during the whole period of delay and that he should be awarded 4,000 pounds sterling (GBP) as non-pecuniary damage.\n39. The Government argued that any delay was not such as justify an award of damages.\n40. In the present case, it is reasonable to assume that the applicant suffered some distress and frustration exacerbated by the unreasonable length of the proceedings. Taking account of the contributory delay imputable to the applicant, the Court awards 2,800 euros (EUR) under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n41. The applicant claimed GBP 4,455.46 for legal costs and expenses, inclusive of value-added tax (VAT).\n42. The Government submitted that this sum was excessive in the circumstances of this case.\n43. Taking account of the fact that the bulk of the applicant's complaints were rejected as inadmissible and deducting the sums paid by way of legal aid by the Council of Europe, the Court awards EUR 2,800 for legal costs and expenses, inclusive of VAT.\n#### C. Default interest\n44. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, in 1974 the applicant had not been the owner of any property located in northern Cyprus. Nor was he, according to the same source, the owner of any property at the present time. Given that in 1974 the applicant had had no right or interest in relation to the properties at issue, no question of a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could arise. Even assuming that the applicant had acquired the properties in question in 1990, this would have happened sixteen years after the events of 1974 and three years after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. Therefore, he should have known that access to the properties was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it.\n13. In the light of the above, the Government argued that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n14. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points. Administrative and judicial remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were therefore accessible to them.\n15. Law no. 49/2003 provided for the establishment of an independent Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission with jurisdiction to award compensation for Greek-Cypriot immovable properties in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, on the basis of the market value on 20 July 1974, plus compensation for the loss of use, loss of income and increases in the value of property. The decisions of this Commission could be appealed to the High Administrative Court. Given the existence of this remedy, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### B. The applicant\u2019s arguments\n16. The applicant observed that his parents had been the lawful owners of the properties in question in 1974. The Government could have ascertained this by consulting the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d. There had been the expectation that the applicant and his sister would, in due course, become the registered owners. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive the applicant\u2019s parents of their title (see Loizidou v. Turkey, (merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The applicant had become the legal owner of the properties on 20 April 1990 and this fact had been recorded by the official authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The donation could not have been recorded by the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d because the authorities of the \u201cTRNC\u201d considered that the properties had already been expropriated. The Government could not rely on the records of the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d to contest the applicant\u2019s title.\n17. Even assuming that the applicant had had no property rights until 20 April 1990, that would only mean that there had not been a continuing violation of his rights under Article 1 Protocol No. 1 between 1974 and that date. In order to establish that there had been a violation of these rights after 20 April 1990, it was sufficient to show that the applicant had not been allowed to enjoy his properties from that date onwards. In any event, the applicant had a proprietary interest in the properties in 1974 and the house were he had been living had been his home. The fact that in 1990 the applicant might have known that he would not have enjoyed his property was irrelevant.\n18. The applicant alleged that Law no. 49/2003 was aimed at providing a false and illusory domestic remedy in order to avoid the property claims of Greek Cypriots being adjudicated by the European Court of Human Rights. Furthermore, the objection of non-exhaustion had been raised after the application had been declared admissible. Law no. 49/2003 had not existed at the time when the application was lodged, did not provide a sufficient and effective remedy, was discriminatory and took as its basis that the expropriation was lawful. Furthermore, the applicant could lose his victim status only if the violation of the Convention was expressly recognised and fully remedied by the respondent Government\u2019s authorities. This had not happened in the present case.\n#### C. Third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n19. The Government of Cyprus submitted that the applicant had acquired his rights as owner in 1990, after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. He was therefore entitled to complain about any violation which had occurred after that date. The appropriate claimant in respect of earlier violations would have been the previous owner (the applicant\u2019s parents).\n20. The third-party intervener further submitted that the compensation available under Law no. 49/2003 did not alter the fact that the Court did not recognise the acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d as expropriation. In any event, the said law did not provide any redress for breaches of Article 8 of the Convention and applied only to an extremely restricted category of violations of the right of property. It could not be considered an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted in relation to claims introduced or declared admissible before it was enacted or enforced. Finally, its provisions were incompatible with Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention as well as with 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### D. The Court\u2019s assessment\n21. In its decision on the admissibility, the Court considered that the Government\u2019s objections that the application was incompatible ratione materiae and ratione temporis were closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaints and that they should be examined together with the merits of the application.\n22. In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the Government did not contest the applicant\u2019s statement that his parents had been the owners of properties in the District of Kyrenia. They argued, however, that the properties at issue had subsequently been expropriated by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. The Court recalls that in the case of Loizidou ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46) it held that it could not attribute legal validity for the purposes of the Convention to the provisions of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d fundamental law, concerning the acquisition by the \u201cTRNC\u201d of the immovable properties considered to be abandoned on 13 February 1975. It furthermore considered that Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, had left their properties in the northern part of the island in 1974 could not be deemed to have lost title to their property. It follows that until 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents had still been the owners of the properties described in paragraph 10 above. They were therefore capable of transmitting ownership to their descendants.\n23. The Court further notes that on 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents donated half of their properties to the applicant and that the latter registered his titles in the Land Registry of the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraph 9 above). In spite of this, he has been unable to make use of and have access to his properties. At the relevant time, Turkey had already recognised the right of individual petition. It is also to be recalled that the Court had duly examined and rejected the objection of inadmissibility by reason of lack of effective control over northern Cyprus raised by the Turkish Government in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 69-81, ECHR 2001-IV). It sees no reason to depart from its reasoning and conclusions in the instant case.\n24. Lastly, as regards the objections of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status raised by the Government in their further observations of 23 October 2003 relating to the Law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the Court notes that these objections were raised after the application was declared admissible. They cannot, therefore, be taken into account at this stage of the proceedings (see Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, \u00a7 20, 31 July 2003).\n25. It follows that the Government\u2019s preliminary objections should be dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus had prevented him from having access to his properties situated in that part of the island.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n27. The Government submitted that, due to the relocation of the populations, it was necessary to facilitate the rehabilitation of Turkish-Cypriot refugees. The Greek-Cypriot side had taken similar measures in respect of abandoned Turkish-Cypriot properties in the southern part of the island.\n28. It would be unrealistic and highly dangerous to recognise the right of the applicant to violate the United Nations \u201cbuffer zone\u201d and have access to his alleged properties. Property rights and the question of reciprocal compensation had to be dealt with through negotiations, within the context of inter-communal talks. There was a public interest in not undermining these talks. The applicant\u2019s complaints had been the consequence of the political situation in Cyprus and not of the 1974 Turkish intervention.\n##### 2. The applicant\n29. The applicant argued that the interference with his property rights could not be justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The policies of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not furnish a legitimate aim since the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d was an illegitimate act. In any event, the need to re-house displaced Turkish Cypriots could not justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that much of the property taken from Greek Cypriots had been used to house settlers from mainland Turkey. The fact that property rights had been one of the subjects under discussion in the inter-communal talks could not justify the taking of property without compensation.\n#### B. The third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n30. The Government of Cyprus observed that their Department of Lands and Surveys had provided certificates of affirmation to those persons who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title was entered in District Land Offices registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.\n31. The Government of Cyprus further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou ((merits), cited above), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### D. The Court\u2019s assessment\n32. The Court recalls that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64), it reasoned as follows:\n\u201c63. ... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.\n64. Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights which is imputable to Turkey.\nIt has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.\nNor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d\n33. In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (\u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189):\n\u201c187. The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cypriots to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n...\n189. .. there has been a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus are being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.\u201d\n34. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the conclusions which it reached in the Loizidou and Cyprus v. Turkey cases (op. cit.; see also Demades (merits), cited above, \u00a7 46).\n35. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been and continues to be a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that the applicant is denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of his properties as well as any compensation for the interference with his property rights.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\nThe applicant submitted that in 1974 he had had his home in Lapithos. As he had been unable to return there, he was the victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThis provision reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n36. The Government disputed this claim.\n37. The applicant submitted that, contrary to the applicant in the Loizidou case, he had had his principal residence in Lapithos. He claimed that any interference with his Article 8 rights had not been justified under the second paragraph of this provision.\n38. The Government of Cyprus submitted that where the applicant\u2019s properties constituted the person\u2019s home, there was a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n39. The Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon the applicant\u2019s statement that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, he was regularly residing in Lapithos and that this house was treated by him and his family as a home.\n40. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the house where the applicant was living qualified as \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention at the time when the acts complained of took place.\n41. The Court observes that the present case differs from the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above) since, unlike Mrs Loizidou, the applicant actually had a home in northern Cyprus.\n42. The Court notes that since 1974 the applicant had been unable to gain access to and to use that home. In this connection, the Court recalls that, in its judgment in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-175), it concluded that the complete denial of the right of Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to respect for their homes in northern Cyprus since 1974 constituted a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\u201c172. The Court observes that the official policy of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities to deny the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes is reinforced by the very tight restrictions operated by the same authorities on visits to the north by Greek Cypriots living in the south. Accordingly, not only are displaced persons unable to apply to the authorities to reoccupy the homes which they left behind, they are physically prevented from even visiting them.\n173. The Court further notes that the situation impugned by the applicant Government has obtained since the events of 1974 in northern Cyprus. It would appear that it has never been reflected in \u2018legislation\u2019 and is enforced as a matter of policy in furtherance of a bi-zonal arrangement designed, it is claimed, to minimise the risk of conflict which the intermingling of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities in the north might engender. That bi-zonal arrangement is being pursued within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary-General ...\n174. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the complete denial of the right of displaced persons to respect for their homes has no basis in law within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 173 above); secondly, the inter-communal talks cannot be invoked in order to legitimate a violation of the Convention; thirdly, the violation at issue has endured as a matter of policy since 1974 and must be considered continuing.\n175. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention by reason of the refusal to allow the return of any Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to their homes in northern Cyprus.\u201d\n43. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the above reasoning and findings in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (op. cit.; see also Demades v. Turkey (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37).\n44. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of the complete denial of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home.\n### VI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n45. The applicant complained of a violation under Article 14 of the Convention on account of discriminatory treatment against him in the enjoyment of him rights under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He alleged that this discrimination had been based on his national origin and religious beliefs.\nArticle 14 of the Convention reads as follows:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n46. The Government disputed these claims. They noted that the differentiation of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities had been a consequence of the political situation on the island which could not be an issue of discrimination under Article 14 of the Convention.\n47. The Government of Cyprus submitted that the policy of the Turkish authorities in the occupied area as far as Greek-Cypriot homes and properties were concerned had been based upon racial discrimination. This was incompatible with Article 14 of the Convention and illegal in terms of customary or general international law.\n48. The Court recalls that in the above-mentioned Cyprus v. Turkey case, it found that, in the circumstances of that case, the Cypriot Government\u2019s complaints under Article 14 amounted in effect to the same complaints, albeit seen from a different angle, as those considered in relation to Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Since it had found a violation of the latter provisions, it considered that it was not necessary in that case to examine whether there had been a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the alleged discriminatory treatment of Greek Cypriots not residing in northern Cyprus as regards their rights to respect for family life and home and to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions (\u00a7 199).\n49. The Court sees no reason in this case to depart from that approach. Bearing in mind its conclusion on the complaints under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, it finds that it is not necessary to carry out a separate examination of the complaint under Article 14 (see, mutatis mutandis, Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios v. Turkey, no. 16163/90, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 31 July 2003).\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n51. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, the applicant requested 695,625 Cypriot pounds (CYP \u2013 approximately 1,188,544 euros (EUR)) for pecuniary damage. He relied on an expert\u2019s report assessing the value of his losses which included the loss of annual rent collected or expected to be collected from renting out his properties, plus interest from the date on which such rents were due until the day of payment. The rent claimed was for the period dating back to January 1987, when the respondent Government accepted the right of individual petition, until 1999. The applicant did not claim compensation for any purported expropriation since he was still the legal owner of the properties. The valuation report contained a description of Lapithos village.\n52. The starting point of the valuation report was the annual rental value of the applicant\u2019s properties in 1974, calculated on the basis of a percentage (5 or 6%) of the market value of the properties or assessed by comparing the rental value of similar land at the relevant time. This sum was subsequently adjusted upwards according to an average annual rental increase of 12% or 5%. Compound interest for delayed payment was applied at a rate of 8% per annum, the total sum due for interest being CYP 226,344 (approximately EUR 386,731).\n53. According to the expert, the 1974 market and rental values of the applicant\u2019s properties listed above in paragraph 9 (a) \u2013 (j) were the following:\nProperty listed under (a): market value CYP 2,510 (approximately EUR 4,288); rental value CYP 150.61 (approximately EUR 257);\nProperty listed under (b): market value CYP 4,059.13 (approximately EUR 6,935); rental value CYP 243.55 (approximately EUR 416);\nProperty listed under (c): market value CYP 14,600.3 (approximately EUR 24,946); rental value CYP 876.03 (approximately EUR 1,496);\nProperty listed under (d): market value CYP 11,133.75 (approximately EUR 19,023); rental value CYP 668.03 (approximately EUR 1,141);\nProperty listed under (e): market value CYP 14,631 (approximately EUR 24,998); rental value CYP 877.86 (approximately EUR 1,500);\nProperty listed under (f): market value CYP 15,554 (approximately EUR 26,575); rental value CYP 778 (approximately EUR 1,329);\nProperty listed under (g): market value CYP 1,781.5 (approximately EUR 3,043); rental value CYP 106.89 (approximately EUR 182);\nProperty listed under (h): market value CYP 5 (approximately EUR 8.5); rental value CYP 0.3 (approximately EUR 0.5);\nProperty listed under (i): market value CYP 28,294 (approximately EUR 48,343); rental value CYP 1,414.7 (approximately EUR 2,417);\nProperty listed under (j): market value CYP 5,250 (approximately EUR 8,970); rental value CYP 315 (approximately EUR 538).\n54. In a letter of 28 January 2008 the applicant observed that a long lapse of time had passed since he had presented his claims for just satisfaction and that the claim for pecuniary losses needed to be updated according to the increase of the market value of land in Cyprus (between 10 and 15% per annum).\n55. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, the applicant claimed CYP 40,000 (approximately EUR 68,344) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He stated that this sum had been calculated on the basis of the sum awarded by the Court in the Loizidou case ((just satisfaction), cited above), taking into account, however, that the period of time for which the damage was claimed in the instant case was longer and that there had also been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention. He further claimed CYP 70,000 (approximately EUR 119,602) in respect of the moral damage suffered for the loss of his home.\n(b) The Government\n56. Following a request from the Court, on 22 September 2008 the Government filed comments on the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction. They observed that the Turkish Cypriot authorities had primary evidence as to the ownership of real estate in northern Cyprus, while the Greek Cypriot authorities only had secondary evidence. Under these circumstances, it could not be ruled out that the affirmations of ownership issued by the Republic of Cyprus had been based on bona fide errors which might have occurred in the reconstruction of the files in southern Cyprus. According to the searches made by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, in 1974 the properties listed in paragraph 10 (d), (e), (i) and (j) above had not been owned by the applicant\u2019s father (Mr Gregoris Orphanides). It followed that Mr Gregoris Orphanides could not have transferred to the applicant properties over which he had had no title of ownership.\n57. Furthermore, the applicant was only a co-owner of the properties which he had acquired in 1990. Before claiming an unfettered right to develop or lease such properties, he should satisfy the Court that at the domestic level the rights of the other co-owners had been respected. In particular, development or lease of co-owned properties depended on the other shareholders\u2019 consent. Without the latter, there could be no development and the property could not bring any profit.\n58. The applicant\u2019s father was not a party to the proceedings and the applicant was not entitled to claim damages on his behalf for the period before the date on which he had acquired ownership. As an annual increase of the value of the properties had been applied, it would be unfair to add compound interest for delayed payment. In any event, the alleged 1974 market value of the properties was exorbitant, highly excessive and speculative; it was not based on any real data with which to make a comparison and made insufficient allowance for the volatility of the property market and its susceptibility to influences both domestic and international. The report submitted by the applicant had instead proceeded on the assumption that the property market would have continued to flourish with sustained growth during the whole period under consideration.\n59. The Government further submitted that Turkey had recognised the jurisdiction of the Court on 21 January 1990, and not in January 1987, and that the question of compensation should be referred to the Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission, an organ which was in a better position to deal with complicated property issues.\n60. The applicant had been unable to establish a title of ownership over any source of water and in any event the freshwater spring referred to in the application had dried up. As water was very scarce in Cyprus, it could be assumed that any freshwater spring which had existed many years ago would have been compulsorily acquired by the Government of Cyprus.\n61. Finally, the Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s submissions under the head of non-pecuniary damage.\n##### 2. The third-party intervener\n62. The Government of Cyprus fully supported the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction.\n##### 3. The Court\u2019s assessment\n63. The Court first notes that the Government\u2019s submission that the records produced by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities showed that in 1974 the properties listed in paragraph 10 (d), (e), (i) and (j) above had not been owned by the applicant\u2019s father (see paragraph 56 above) is, in substance, a further objection of incompatibility ratione materiae with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an objection should have been raised before the application was declared admissible or, at the latest, in the context of the parties\u2019 observations on the merits. In any event, the Court cannot but confirm its finding that until 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents had been the owners of the properties described in paragraph 10 above (see paragraph 22 above).\n64. The Court further notes that the Government\u2019s submission that the damage suffered by the applicant should be determined by the Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission and not by the Strasbourg organs is, in substance, a repetition of the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. Such an objection has been rejected by the Court for the reasons indicated in paragraph 24 of the present judgment. The Court does not see any reason to depart from its conclusions on this issue.\n65. In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage is not ready for decision. It observes, in particular, that the parties have failed to provide reliable and objective data pertaining to the prices of land and real estate in Cyprus at the date of the Turkish intervention. This failure renders it difficult for the Court to assess whether the estimate furnished by the applicant of the 1974 market value of his plots of land is reasonable. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant (Rule 75 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n66. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, the applicant sought CYP 5,480 (approximately EUR 9,363) and 1,410.93 British pounds (\u00a3) (approximately EUR 1,780) for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. These sums (totalling EUR 11,143) included the cost of the expert report assessing the value of his properties.\n67. The Government did not comment on this point.\n68. In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of costs and expenses is not ready for decision. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n##### 1. Dismisses by six votes to one the Government\u2019s preliminary objections;\n2. Holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention;\n3. Holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n4. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine whether there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1;\n5. Holds unanimously that the question of the application of Article 41 is not ready for decision;\naccordingly,\n(a) reserves the said question in whole;\n(b) invites the Government and the applicant to submit, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement that they may reach;\n(c) reserves the further procedure and delegates to the President of the Chamber the power to fix the same if need be.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 January 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the dissenting opinion of Judge Karaka\u015f is annexed to this judgment.\nN.B.\nT.L.E.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE KARAKA\u015e\n(Translation)\nUnlike the majority, I consider that the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies raised by the Government should not have been rejected. Consequently, I cannot agree with the finding of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThe rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is intended to give Contracting States the opportunity to prevent or provide redress for violations alleged against them before such allegations are referred to the Court. That reflects the subsidiary nature of the Convention system.\nFaced with the scale of the problem of deprivations of title to property alleged by Greek Cypriots (approximately 1,400 applications of this type lodged against Turkey), the Court, in the operative part of its Xenides\u2011Arestis v. Turkey judgment of 22 December 2005, required the respondent State to provide a remedy guaranteeing the effective protection of the rights set forth in Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the context of all the similar cases pending before it. The State has a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, but also to select the general or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. The Government submitted that by enacting the Law on Compensation for Immovable Properties (Law no. 67/2005) and setting up a Commission to deal with compensation claims it had discharged that obligation (see also Xenides\u2011Arestis v. Turkey (just satisfaction), no. 46347/99, \u00a7 37, 7 December 2006). It is that domestic remedy which, in their submission, the applicant failed to exercise in the present case.\nThe exhaustion of domestic remedies is normally assessed at the time when an application is lodged with the Court. However, there are exceptions to the rule which may be justified by the particular circumstances of each case (see Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, 22 May 2001).\nExamples of such exceptions are to be found in the cases against Italy which raised similar questions and in which the Court found that certain specific facts justified departing from the general principle (see Brusco v. Italy (dec.), no. 69789/01, 6 September 2001).\nIn other examples the Court also took the view, in the light of the specific facts of the cases concerned, and having regard to the subsidiary nature of the Convention mechanism, that new domestic remedies had not been exhausted (see the following decisions: Nogolica v. Croatia, no. 77784/01, 5 September 2002; Slavi\u010dek v. Croatia, no. 20862/02, 4 July 2002; Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v. Slovakia, nos. 57984/00, 60226/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00 and 68563/01; and I\u00e7yer v. Turkey, no. 18888/02, 29 January 2002).\nIn situations where there is no effective remedy affording the opportunity to complain of alleged violations, individuals are systematically compelled to submit to the European Court of Human Rights applications which could have been investigated first of all within the domestic legal order. In that way, the functioning of the Convention system risks losing its effectiveness in the long term (the most pertinent example is the Broniowski case, no. 31443/96, 22 June 2004).\nIn my opinion the above examples provide an opportunity to review the conditions for admissibility in the event of a major change in the circumstances of the case. For the similar post-Loizidou cases, the Court can always reconsider its admissibility decision and examine the preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies.\nSince the Court may reject \u201cat any stage of the proceedings\u201d (Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention) an application which it considers inadmissible, new facts brought to its attention may lead it, even when examining the case on the merits, to reconsider the decision in which the application was declared admissible and ultimately declare it inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, taking due account of the context (see, for example, Medeanu v. Romania (dec.), no. 29958/96, 8 April 2003, and Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43, 28 April 2004).\nThe existence of a \u201cnew fact\u201d which has come to light after the admissibility decision may prompt the Court to reconsider that decision.\nI consider that the Law on Compensation for Immovable Properties (Law no. 67/2005) and the Commission set up to deal with compensation claims, which are based on the guiding principles laid down by the Court in the Xenides-Arestis case, are capable of providing an opportunity for the State authorities to provide redress for breaches of the Convention\u2019s provisions, including breaches alleged in applications already lodged with the Court before the Act\u2019s entry into force (see I\u00e7yer v. Turkey, cited above, \u00a7 72). That consideration also applies to applications already declared admissible by the Court (see Azinas, cited above).\nIn order to conclude whether there has or has not been a breach of the Convention, complainants must first exercise the new domestic remedy and then, if necessary, lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights, the international court. Following that logic, I cannot in this case find any violation of the Convention\u2019s provisions.", "001-79346": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF WASSDAHL v. SWEDEN\n(Application no. 36619/03)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n6 February 2007\nFINAL\n23/05/2007\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Wassdahl v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr A.B. Baka, President,\nMr I. Cabral Barreto,\nMr M. Ugrekhelidze,\nMrs A. Mularoni,\nMrs E. Fura-Sandstr\u00f6m,\nMs D. Jo\u010dien\u0117,\nMr D. Popovi\u0107, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that the length of the administrative proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n23. The period to be taken into consideration began on 28 May 1996 and ended on 11 September 2003. It thus lasted over seven years and three months for one administrative and three judicial levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not awaited the final outcome of the national compensation proceedings against the Swedish State before introducing the complaint before the Court. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court, pronounced on 9 June 2005, where the plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, there was an effective remedy available to the applicant which he should have been obliged to exhaust before complaining to the Court. In any event, they claimed that he should now be required to await the final outcome of the national compensation proceedings before his application was dealt with by the Court.\n25. The Court first observes that the judgment of the Supreme Court referred to by the Government was pronounced on 9 June 2005, i.e. almost one year and seven months after the applicant lodged the present application with the Court. Thus, at the time of introduction of the present application to the Court, there were no indications that there existed an effective remedy in Sweden for complaints relating to the length of proceedings. The Court therefore considers that the applicant had exhausted the domestic remedies available to him at the time when he complained to the Court.\n26. However, since the applicant in any event instituted compensation proceedings against the State and these are still pending before the Supreme Court, the question arises whether the outcome of these proceedings should be awaited before the Court deals with the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n27. In this respect, the Court notes that the case referred to by the Government concerned criminal proceedings, where the complainant had been acquitted of the charges against him, whereas the present case relates to administrative proceedings, involving tax surcharges, for which there does not yet exist any guiding judgment from the Supreme Court. Moreover, both the District Court and the Court of Appeal rejected the complaint about the length of the proceedings before the administrative courts without giving any reasons, but simply stating that they did not find the proceedings to have been of excessive length. Here, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was adopted in November 2005, i.e. after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment referred to by the Government, but without making any reference to it. Lastly, the Court notes that the compensation proceedings have already been pending for more than a year before the Supreme Court, awaiting its decision on whether to grant leave to appeal.\n28. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that, for the purposes of the present case, the Government have not shown that the pending compensation proceedings in Sweden can be considered to be an effective remedy for the applicant, and it would thus be unreasonable to prolong the proceedings before the Court even further. It follows that the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.\n29. The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n30. The Government left it to the Court to decide whether, on the merits, the complaint revealed a violation of the Convention.\n31. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n32. The Court considers that the present case did not concern matters of particular complexity and that the applicant was not responsible for any significant delays. On the contrary, it is of the opinion that there were prolonged periods of inactivity, in particular before the County Administrative Court, which were attributable to the national courts, and that their handling of the case did not promote its timely completion. In this respect, the Court observes that a significant amount of money (approximately SEK 147,000 in tax surcharges) was at stake for the applicant.\n33. Thus, in the light of the criteria laid down in its case-law and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings of which complaint is made was, overall, excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n34. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n35. The applicant claimed SEK 1,900,276 (approximately EUR 210,000) in respect of pecuniary damage and SEK 4,500,000 (approximately EUR 497,000) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n36. The Government contested these claims.\n37. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it considers that the applicant must have sustained some non-pecuniary damage because of the excessive length of the national proceedings. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him EUR 1,500 under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n38. The applicant also claimed SEK 35,000 (approximately EUR 3,900) for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and left it for the Court to assess a fair reimbursement for his costs incurred before the Court, stressing that he had spent many hours of his own time preparing his case since he had not been represented by a lawyer.\n39. The Government contested the claim.\n40. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and finds it reasonable to award the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, the sum of EUR 500 for costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n41. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Swedish kronor at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 6 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Hill v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr M.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2003 and on 6 April 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences and tariffs\n13. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. At the time of sentence, a \u201ctariff\u201d is imposed which represents the minimum period that the prisoner will have to serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. A life prisoner will not be released on licence until after the tariff period has been completed.\n#### B. Release on licence of mandatory life sentence prisoners\n14. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in Section 35(2):\n\u201cIf recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.\u201d\n15. On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on licence, the Secretary of State:\n\u201c...will consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.\u201d\n16. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (\u201cthe tariff\u201d) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see for example, R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 WLR135; R. v. Parole Board ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 AllER576).\n#### C. Recent developments\n17. Following the judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV), the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons on 17 October 2002 his decision to introduce interim measures applicable to the review and release of mandatory life sentence prisoners applicable to reviews from 1 January 2003. This allows for prisoners, whose tariff had expired, to apply for an oral hearing at which they may have representation, receive full disclosure of material relevant to the question of release and be able to examine and cross-examine witnesses.\n\u201cIf, at the end of the review process, the Parole Board favours the release of a mandatory life sentence prisoner once the minimum period has been served the Home Secretary will normally accept such a recommendation. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complains about the review procedure applying to his continued detention, invoking Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention which provides:\n\u201c4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n19. The applicant submitted that since his tariff expired he has not had any proper review of his continued detention, as the Parole Board had no power to order his release and none of his reviews involved an oral hearing. His first oral hearing had been scheduled to take place in November 2003, ten years after the expiry of his tariff. As held in Benjamin and Wilson v. the United Kingdom (no. 28212/95, judgment of 26 September 2002), it was not sufficient either that the Secretary of State agreed to abide by the Parole Board recommendations.\n20. The Government submitted that, insofar as Stafford v. United Kingdom (cited above) was relevant to the applicant's complaints, he would enjoy the benefit of the interim arrangements announced by the Secretary of State on 17 October 2002. Further, this case could be distinguished from Stafford in which the Parole Board had recommended the applicant's release on life licence, whereas no such recommendation had been made in the present applicant's case.\n21. The Court recalls that in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (cited above) it found that the continued detention of a mandatory life prisoner sentenced for murder depended, after the expiry of the tariff which was the punishment element of the sentence, on elements of risk and dangerousness that could change with the course of time. Article 5 \u00a7 4 therefore required that he should be able periodically to challenge the continuing legality of his detention in an appropriate procedure.\n22. In this case, the applicant's tariff under his mandatory life sentence expired in or about 1993. While the Parole Board reviewed the applicant's case in 2001, it did not have any power to order his release and could only make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Nor did any oral hearing take place, with the opportunity to examine or cross-examine witnesses relevant to any allegations that the applicant remained a risk to the public. The Government did not dispute that the lawfulness of the applicant's continued detention was not reviewed by a body with the power to order release or with a procedure containing the necessary judicial safeguards as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The fact that the Parole Board has never in fact recommended this applicant's release does not deprive him of the right to have a review by a body offering the requisite guarantees.\n23. The Court concludes that there has been in that respect a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cEveryone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\u201d\n25. The applicant submitted that he had further been denied an enforceable right to compensation as provided by Article 5 \u00a7 5 in respect of any breaches of the other provisions of Article 5.\n26. The Government made no submissions on the point.\n27. The Court has found above a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 in that the applicant did not receive a review of the lawfulness of his detention in accordance with the requirements of that provision. No possibility of obtaining compensation existed at the relevant time in domestic law in respect of that breach of the Convention. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 5.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicant claimed non-pecuniary loss, submitting that he had experienced particularly intense feelings of distress and frustration throughout the ten year period since his tariff has expired. As the Secretary of State rejected positive recommendations from the Parole Board, he was led to the conclusion that his prospects of securing release had been substantially damaged by the lack of a procedure to enable a court-like body to determine his release. He also referred to delays between those reviews which did take place. He proposed 4,000 pounds sterling (GBP).\n30. The Government denied that there was any causal connection between the alleged breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 and the applicant's detention since expiry of tariff. Any assertion that he would have been released earlier was purely speculative. They noted that he had asked for his latest Parole Board review to be postponed. They submitted that no award was appropriate.\n31. The Court notes that it has found a procedural breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 above and that there has been no finding of substantive unlawfulness. It is not possible to speculate as to the applicant's prospects of release if the procedures had conformed with Article 5 \u00a7 4. Nonetheless, it considers that the applicant must have suffered feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety from the situation which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of violation. Having regard to awards made in similar cases, the Court awards, on an equitable basis, 2,200 euros (EUR).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n32. The applicant claimed GBP 2,568 for legal costs and expenses, plus GBP 449.40 for value added tax (VAT), making a total of GBP 3,017.50. This included 10.70 hours work charged by his solicitor at GBP 240 an hour.\n33. The Government considered that the rate of GBP 240 was excessive and that the total sum could be reduced to GBP 1,500. They also pointed out that Council of Europe legal aid should be deducted.\n34. The Court considers that the amounts claimed by the applicant are not unreasonable as to hours charged or as to quantum overall. Taking into account the amount of legal aid paid by the Council of Europe, it awards EUR 3,827 for legal costs and expenses, inclusive of VAT.\n#### C. Default interest\n35.

Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n20. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1987 and 1996, when the applicant made his applications to the Office, this corresponded to 6,868 and 10,317 Swedish kronor (SEK), respectively.\n#### B. Procedure\n21. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Appeals may be made against the Office\u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act.\n22. The latter provision enables the Office to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision, provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court. Thus, the Office must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error, miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason. The question of changing a decision under section 10 a should, in principle, be raised within two years from the day the decision was taken. However, it may nevertheless be changed if it appears only after the elapse of this two-year period that it was based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or if there are other exceptional reasons. A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned.\n23. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n24. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n25. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal had constituted a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n27. The Government questioned whether the proceedings at issue had involved a determination of the applicant\u2019s civil rights and thus whether Article 6 was applicable in the case. They maintained that the proceedings before the Administrative Court of Appeal had concerned the issue of whether or not the applicant had been entitled to a review of the Office\u2019s original decision not to grant him disability benefits. They contended that that was mainly a procedural issue and noted, furthermore, that the appellate court had in fact not ruled on the merits of the case.\n28. Moreover, the Government claimed that it had been justified to dispense with an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case. They contended that a hearing would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they submitted that the issue to be examined by the Administrative Court of Appeal had mainly concerned points of law, as it had had to decide whether the Office\u2019s original decision had been based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or there had been other exceptional reasons to change the decision by virtue of chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act. They also pointed out that the applicant had stated, as reasons for his request for a hearing, that the person in charge of the case at the Office be heard. This had been irrelevant, as that official could hardly have been expected to provide any other information than what was already apparent from the Office\u2019s decision and the documents in the case. Furthermore, all the relevant evidence in the case had been in writing. The judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s need of assistance or his expenses due to his handicap by meeting him in person but had had to rely on the written medical evidence submitted in the case. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing his case in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under a social-insurance scheme, no questions of public interest had been involved.\n29. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold an oral hearing and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing, he had, at least tacitly, waived his right to have his case heard in public before that judicial instance.\n##### 2. The applicant\n30. The applicant maintained that the examination by the Administrative Court of Appeal under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act had necessarily comprised an assessment of the facts of the case and had thus involved a determination of his \u201ccivil rights\u201d. Article 6 was thus applicable.\n31. Moreover, the applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. He stated that the case had not mainly concerned points of law; rather, the assessment under chapter 20, section 10 a implied that the appellate court examine on the merits the new circumstances that had been invoked in the case. He claimed that the case could not have been decided only on the available medical certificates but had required also an assessment of the applicant\u2019s personal situation. It had therefore been indispensable to hold a hearing at which the applicant would have had an opportunity to complete the case file by giving an account of his medical situation and its effects on his everyday life, including his extra expenses and need of assistance. Also, the County Administrative Court had given judgment in his favour and the Administrative Court of Appeal had been divided in rejecting his case. Thus, the case had been of a borderline nature which had further emphasised the need for an oral hearing. The new procedural situation in the appellate court \u2013 with the Board acting as opposing party \u2013 had also called for a hearing.\n32. The applicant also found it remarkable that the appellate court had considered a hearing to be unnecessary without giving any further reasons. He therefore could not assess whether the decisions had been in compliance with the 1971 Act.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n33. The Court observes that the proceedings at issue concerned the applicant\u2019s claim to benefits under a social-security scheme. They determined the preliminary question whether the Office\u2019s decision of 24 April 1987 had been based on obviously incomplete material and thus whether there was a basis under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act to review that decision. It is true that the Administrative Court of Appeal, in finding that there was no such basis, did not formally examine the merits of the case. However, the preliminary question and the merits were indissociable in that an examination of the former necessarily involved an assessment of the merits. As is shown by the opinion of the dissenting judges in the appellate court and the judgment of the County Administrative Court, the conclusion that there was a basis to review the Office\u2019s original decision to refuse the applicant disability benefits necessarily led to a reversal of that decision and a finding that the applicant was entitled to the benefits in question. The Court further notes that, in appealing against the first instance judgment, the Board relied on the contention that it had not been shown that the applicant had a need of assistance or extra expenses which attained the level required under the 1962 Act and thus, in essence, argued on the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim. In the Court\u2019s opinion, these circumstances show that, in examining the Board\u2019s appeal and determining the preliminary question whether there was a basis for a review of the Office\u2019s original decision, the appellate court did not merely examine a procedural issue but in fact assessed the merits of the case. The Court therefore concludes that its examination involved a determination of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d and that the proceedings in the case accordingly fall within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53).\n##### 2. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1\n34. The Court first finds that the entitlement to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 necessarily implies a right to an \u201coral hearing\u201d. However, the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be done explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\nFurthermore, a hearing may not be necessary due to exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201111, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; and Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 44).\n35. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant did not request a hearing before the County Administrative Court. As Section 9 of the 1971 Act provided that the proceedings before the administrative courts were normally in writing, the applicant could have been expected to request a hearing before that court if he attached importance to it. He did not do so, however, and the Court therefore finds that he can reasonably be considered to have waived his right to a hearing before the County Administrative Court.\nMoreover, the Supreme Administrative Court only determined whether or not leave to appeal should be granted and, as a consequence of its refusal to grant leave, did not make a full examination of the applicant\u2019s case. Even assuming that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to the determination of this question, the Court finds that it could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the written submissions and that, accordingly, the absence of an oral hearing before the Supreme Administrative Court was justified.\n36. It remains to be determined whether the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal involved a breach of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance there is normally a right to a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment cited above, p. 20, \u00a7 64). However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36). Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance.\n37. The Court notes that no hearing was held at first instance since the applicant did not request the County Administrative Court to hold one. It acknowledges that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing is held already at first instance rather than only before the appellate court. Depending on the circumstances of the case, it might therefore be acceptable to reject a request for a hearing upon appeal, although no such hearing has been held at first instance.\n38. The Court further recognises that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\n39. In the applicant\u2019s case, the Court observes that the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not limited to matters of law but also extended to factual issues. The main issue in the case was whether the applicant\u2019s need of assistance and his additional costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. It is true that the written medical evidence was of considerable importance to the determination of this issue. However, this evidence, being clearly in the applicant\u2019s favour, was not a matter of dispute in the case. Instead, the outcome depended on an assessment of which needs and costs could be considered as deriving from the applicant\u2019s speech handicap and an estimation of the total amount of the various items. In requesting an oral hearing, the applicant stated, inter alia, that he wished to ask questions to the Board and that, in assessing his condition, the appellate court would benefit from having met him in person. In these circumstances, it appears that an oral hearing could have provided information of relevance to the determination of the case.\nThe Court also notes that the Administrative Court of Appeal gave judgment against the applicant whereas the County Administrative Court and a minority in the Administrative Court of Appeal found in favour of the applicant on the issue whether his needs and costs were such that he was eligible for a disability allowance.\n40. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court cannot find that there were exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with a hearing. Having expressly requested an oral hearing in the Administrative Court of Appeal, the applicant was thus entitled to such a hearing before that instance.\nThe refusal by the Administrative Court of Appeal to hold an oral hearing amounted therefore to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n41. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Legislative amendment\n42. The applicant asked the Court to order the Swedish Government to undertake a reform of the law by which it should \u201ctake measures to preclude the occurrence of breaches of the Convention, such as occurred in respect of the applicant, in the future\u201d.\n43. The Government maintained that legislative measures did not fall within the scope of Article 41 of the Convention.\n44. The Court notes that the Convention does not empower it to order a State to alter its legislation; the Court\u2019s judgment leaves to the State the choice of the means to be used in its domestic legal system to give effect to its obligation under Article 46 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Belilos v. Switzerland, judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 33, \u00a7 78).\n#### B. Damage\n45. The applicant submitted that he had sustained pecuniary damage in that the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment in his favour would not have been quashed by the Administrative Court of Appeal had the latter held an oral hearing in the case. He estimated that loss at SEK 86,123.\n46. The Government contended that there was no causal link between a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages.\n47. The Court rejects the applicant\u2019s claim as it cannot speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings had a hearing taken place before the appellate court.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n48. The applicant claimed SEK 41,250, including value-added tax (VAT), in legal fees for the domestic proceedings and SEK 103,000, excluding VAT, in legal fees and translation costs for the proceedings before the Commission and the Court. The legal fees corresponded to 41.25 hours of work for the applicant\u2019s first counsel in the domestic proceedings as well as 72 and 12 hours of work, respectively, for the two counsel in those before the Convention organs.\n49. The Government considered the number of hours of work stated by the applicant to be excessive. Noting that the invoices submitted were not specified and that the translation costs were not supported by any documentation, they submitted that the legal fees incurred in the domestic proceedings seemed to relate to the case as a whole and not only to work pertaining to the requests for an oral hearing. As regards the work undertaken in the proceedings before the Convention organs, the Government pointed out that part of the application had been declared inadmissible by the Court on 4 May 2000 and contended that the change of counsel had entailed additional costs. If the Court were to find a violation in regard to the question of an oral hearing, they regarded as appropriate the award of a sum not exceeding SEK 31,500 in respect of costs and expenses.\n50. The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, 10 May 2001, \u00a7 120). Moreover, compensation for costs incurred in the domestic proceedings may only be granted in so far as they were necessary in trying to prevent the violation found (see K\u00f6nig v. Germany (Article 50), judgment of 10 March 1980, Series A no. 36, p. 17, \u00a7 20). In the present case, the Court finds that only a smaller part of the stated costs incurred in the domestic proceedings can be considered to relate to the issue of an oral hearing. As regards the proceedings before the Convention organs, it further takes into account that the translation costs have not been substantiated and that the applicant was only partially successful with his application. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant by way of costs and expenses the global sum of EUR 5,000, including VAT.\n#### D. Default interest\n51. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], application no. 28957, \u00a7 124, to be published in ECHR 2002).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 November 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President\nN.B.\nM.O\u2019B.", "001-57899": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BONER v.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Presence of witness in court\n17. Under Scots law, a witness who has been present in court without the court\u2019s permission and without consent from the opposite party may still be allowed to give evidence provided that \u201cit appears to the court that the presence of the witness was not the result of culpable negligence or criminal intent, and that the witness had not been unduly instructed or influenced by what took place during his presence, or that injustice will not be done by his examination\u201c (section 140 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c).\n#### B. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n18. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n19. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the 1975 Act). No leave to appeal is required.\n20. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n21. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n22. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### C. Representation of appellants by counsel\n23. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### D. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n24. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n25. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n26. To extend legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n27. The Board takes its decisions on the basis of the documents before it, which normally include copies of the note of appeal, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the trial judge\u2019s report on the case. The views expressed by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and counsel will also be taken into account.\n28. Although the legislation does not provide for a formal review, the Board will, as a matter of practice, when requested to do so, reconsider an application which has been refused. Such reconsideration involves the application being referred to an external reporter, who was not involved in the Board\u2019s earlier decision and who reports to the Board on the merits of the application. Otherwise, Board decisions are subject to ordinary judicial review.\n29. If the appellant proceeds with his appeal without legal aid and the court considers that, prima facie, he may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds, the court must immediately adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the Board\u2019s decision be reviewed.\n30. The practice of the court in this regard was formalised following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Granger v. the United Kingdom of 28 March 1990 (Series A no. 174) by a Practice Note to this effect issued on 4 December 1990 by the Lord Justice General to all Appeal Court Chairmen and Clerks:\n\u201cIn any appeal where legal aid has been refused and the court considers that prima facie an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that the appellant should have legal representation in arguing his grounds, the court shall forthwith adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the decision to refuse legal aid should be reviewed.\u201c\n31. Where such a recommendation is made, legal aid is automatically granted. To this end, the Manual of Procedure of the Scottish Legal Aid Board provides in paragraph 6.12 that:\n\u201cIn these circumstances the Board will receive a letter from the High Court of Justiciary giving the details of the case where they are recommending a re-consideration of the decision to refuse. If we are asked to re-consider a decision in these circumstances, then the application should be granted automatically. The case need not be seen by a reporter or Board solicitor, but ought to be referred to the Assistant Manager for the appropriate action.\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n32. Mr Boner applied to the Commission on 4 April 1991. He relied on Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, complaining that he had been refused legal aid.\n33. The Commission declared the application (no. 18711/91) admissible on 9 December 1992. In its report of 4 May 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by seventeen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n34. At the hearing on 18 April 1993, the applicant invited the Court\n\u201cto find and declare that there has been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights in terms of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c), and that in the circumstances just satisfaction should be awarded in terms of Article 50 (art. 50) at such a sum as the Court deems appropriate\u201c.\nThe Government, for their part, requested the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 (art. 6).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) OF THE CONVENTION\n35. The applicant who had been sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment complained that he had been refused legal aid for his appeal against conviction in breach of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n... \u201c\nThis contention was accepted by the Commission but disputed by the Government.\n36. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3-c) attaches two conditions to an accused\u2019s right to receive legal aid. The first, \u201clack of sufficient means to pay for legal assistance\u201c, is not in dispute in the present case. The only issue before the Court is therefore whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c required that the applicant be granted such assistance free.\n37. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the manner in which paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) is to be applied in relation to appellate or cassation courts depends upon the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (see, inter alia, the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, para. 56).\n38. The Scottish system of criminal appeals grants all persons a right to appeal. No special leave is required (see paragraph 19 above). The High Court of Justiciary, in its appellate function, has wide powers to dispose of appeals (see paragraph 22 above). The procedure is not limited to specific grounds; any alleged miscarriage of justice may be challenged (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, the proceedings always involve an oral hearing at which the Crown is represented (see paragraph 21 above).\nHowever, not all appellants who qualify on financial grounds obtain legal assistance. An independent body (the Scottish Legal Aid Board) decides on the basis of a file whether an applicant has substantial grounds for taking an appeal and whether it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation (see paragraphs 24-29 above).\n39. According to the applicant and the Commission, the interests of justice required that Mr Boner be granted legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal on 24 January 1991 before the High Court of Justiciary. They referred to the Granger case previously cited, where the Court had found a violation, and concluded that there were substantial similarities between Granger and the present case.\n40. The Government sought to distinguish the two cases. In their contention, the appeal court in Granger, after hearing the appellant\u2019s submissions, considered that there was a point of substance which required further examination. Counsel for the Crown was required to present a long and elaborate argument, which the appellant could neither understand nor respond to. None of these features is to be found in the present case.\nThe Government further noted that the applicant was not obliged to address the court at the oral hearing and that counsel for the Crown does not appear to have made submissions before it.\nIn addition, Mr Boner could not, in any event, have found counsel willing to represent him, in view of the rules of professional ethics which impose a duty on counsel not to act for an appellant where they are satisfied that he had no proper basis for bringing an appeal (see paragraph 23 above).\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the Granger judgment, a safeguard had been introduced. The Practice Note by the Lord Justice General, dated 4 December 1990, taken in conjunction with the practice of the Scottish Legal Aid Board (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above), ensures that, in any appeal where legal aid has been refused, such aid is automatically granted where the court has reached the conclusion that, prima facie, an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and that it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds. Accordingly, under the new system, as soon as it becomes clear that an unrepresented appellant has a point which appears to be of substance, the appeal court must adjourn the appeal to enable the appellant to obtain representation and legal aid will in fact be granted. The effect is thus that there can be no repetition of the unfairness which was found to have occurred in the Granger case.\n41. The Court notes that, as the Government pointed out, there are indeed differences between the two cases. In addition, the introduction of a new practice more favourable to the unrepresented appellant is undoubtedly a positive development.\nThe legal issue in this case may not have been particularly complex. Nevertheless, to attack in appeal proceedings a judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in the course of a trial (see paragraph 8 above) requires a certain legal skill and experience. That Mr Boner was able to understand the grounds for his appeal and that counsel was not prepared to represent him (see paragraph 40 above) does not alter the fact that without the services of a legal practitioner he was unable competently to address the court on this legal issue and thus to defend himself effectively (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pakelli v. Germany judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 64, p. 18, para. 38).\nMoreover, the appeal court, as stated, had wide powers to dispose of his appeal and its decision was final. Of even greater relevance, however, the applicant had been sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. For Mr Boner therefore the issue at stake was an extremely important one.\n42. The Government maintained that a finding of a violation in this case might have as its consequence the ending of the automatic right of appeal, thereby effectively diminishing the rights of the accused.\n43. It is not the Court\u2019s function to indicate the measures to be taken by national authorities to ensure that their appeals system satisfies the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6). Its task is solely to determine whether the system chosen by them in this connection leads to results which, in the cases which come before it, are consistent with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) (see, inter alia, the Quaranta v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 205, p. 15, para. 30).\nThe situation in a case such as the present, involving a heavy penalty, where an appellant is left to present his own defence unassisted before the highest instance of appeal, is not in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6).\n44. Given the nature of the proceedings, the wide powers of the High Court, the limited capacity of an unrepresented appellant to present a legal argument and, above all, the importance of the issue at stake in view of the severity of the sentence, the Court considers that the interests of justice required that the applicant be granted legal aid for representation at the hearing of his appeal.\nIn conclusion, there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\n45. Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\nUnder this provision Mr Boner sought compensation for alleged non-pecuniary damage in an amount to be fixed by the Court. In the applicant\u2019s submission, such compensation should serve as \u201ca solatium for the injury to his feelings and state of mind\u201c resulting from the refusal of legal aid.\n46. The Court agrees with the Government that the non-pecuniary damage thus caused is sufficiently compensated by a finding that there had been a breach of Article 6 (art. 6).\n47. Mr Boner also claimed reimbursement of the costs and expenses entailed by the proceedings before the Convention institutions, which he quantified at \u00a310,955.22.\nThe Government objected to the method used to calculate the solicitors\u2019 estimated account of expenses and stated that they would accept a total of \u00a37,500.28 (value-added tax included). The applicant\u2019s representative explained at the hearing that she had been instructed not to insist on this aspect of the claim.\n48. The Court grants the last sum proposed, less 16,275.79 French francs already paid by way of legal aid.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention;\n2. Holds as regards the claim for non-pecuniary damage that the present judgment constitutes, in itself, sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention;\n3. Holds that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant, within three months, \u00a37,500.28 (seven thousand five hundred pounds sterling and twenty-eight pence) less FRF 16,275.79 (sixteen thousand two hundred and seventy-five French francs and seventy-nine centimes) to be converted into pounds sterling in accordance with the exchange rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment, in respect of legal costs and expenses;\n4. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 October 1994.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nHerbert PETZOLD\nActing Registrar\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the concurring opinions of Mr De Meyer and Sir John Freeland are annexed to this judgment.\nR. R.\n#### H. P.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\nThe \u201cinterests of justice\u201c normally require that a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201c be assisted by a lawyer.\nWithout such assistance very few people are able \u201cto present\u201c their \u201ccase in an adequate manner\u201c1 and \u201cto make an effective contribution to the proceedings\u201c2.\nThis is so at each stage of them, and even more so in the higher instances.\nIt has to be observed thereby that legal assistance is needed, not only in so far as it is \u201cuseful ... to the examination of the legal questions\u201c3 in a narrow sense, but also since it is proper to ensure that the facts be ascertained, understood and appraised in a legally relevant manner.\nThe burden of proving that the interests of justice require legal assistance must not be laid upon the accused person. In order legitimately to dispense with such assistance, if the person concerned has not knowingly and willingly waived it, it has to be clearly and convincingly established that they do not require it in the instance concerned.\nThere were no valid reasons for such an exception in the circumstances of the present case.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF SIR JOHN FREELAND\n1. I have voted with the other members of the Court for the finding that there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c), but the reasoning which has led me to this conclusion has in certain respects differed from theirs.\n2. On the one hand, the material before the Court has to my mind gone far to demonstrate that the possibility of Mr Boner\u2019s having in fact suffered any substantive injustice by virtue of his lack of legal representation at the hearing of his appeal is extremely remote. His solicitors and counsel had, in accordance with their rules of professional conduct, declined to continue to act for him because they had come to the view that the grounds of appeal could not be supported; and the Scottish Legal Aid Board had refused his application for legal aid for the appeal because it was not satisfied that there were substantial grounds for making the appeal. He nevertheless exercised the unfettered right of appeal to which every person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland is entitled. The appellate court judges would have been provided, well in advance of the hearing, with the appellant\u2019s written grounds of appeal, to which no answers were submitted by the prosecution, and with the other papers in the case. They would have known in advance that the appellant was to be unrepresented. In their prior consideration of the matter and at the hearing itself they would have taken particular care to determine whether any of the grounds advanced by him, however inexpertly argued, might raise a point of substance. In accordance with long tradition, they would have been at pains to ensure that he, as an appellant in person, was treated with courtesy and consideration and was not placed in a humiliating or distressing position as a result of his lack of legal expertise. Counsel for the Crown, who apparently took no active part in the hearing, would have been under a duty to draw to the court\u2019s attention any substantial arguments of which he was aware that might weigh in the appellant\u2019s favour. Lastly, if at any stage the court had concluded that Mr Boner might have had substantial grounds for taking the appeal, then, in conformity with the practice introduced in the wake of the Granger case, it would have immediately adjourned the hearing and legal assistance would have been provided.\n3. On the other hand, even if, as I believe, no substantive injustice has been established, that does not dispose of the question whether, in the words of sub-paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c), \u201cthe interests of justice\u201c required that Mr Boner should be given free legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal. As we were reminded in argument, justice should not only be done, it should also be seen to be done. The appeal raised a legal issue concerning the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion and Mr Boner\u2019s conviction had led to the imposition of a sentence of eight years\u2019 imprisonment. As regards the view taken by Mr Boner\u2019s solicitors and counsel and by the Legal Aid Board of the prospects of success of an appeal, lawyers may of course disagree; and it was clear from the pleadings of the Government themselves that there have been cases in which legal aid has been refused yet counsel has subsequently appeared for an appellant and won his appeal. More importantly, the Crown was represented at the hearing of the appeal (as it is in all comparable cases) by counsel who was present and able to advance a legal argument if called upon by the court to do so. Admittedly he was not called upon; but that might be simply because the absence of legal assistance left Mr Boner unable to persuade the court that he had an argument which required a response. Given that there was a legal issue to be addressed on Mr Boner\u2019s appeal and that, having regard to the severity of his sentence, so much was at stake for him, I am satisfied that his lack of legal representation for the hearing, when counsel for the Crown was present, produced at least the appearance of injustice.\n4. I have therefore, on balance, concluded that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c should have been regarded as requiring the grant to him of free legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal and that failure to grant such assistance amounted, in the circumstances, to a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).", "001-89821": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF GENCER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. According to Article 24 \u00a7 1 of Law no. 3083, persons who are convicted of the offences defined in the first Section of the second Part of the Criminal Code and in Articles 312 \u00a7 2, 536 and 537 of the Criminal Code cannot benefit from the distribution of land. Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the same Law provides that land shall be taken back, had the right holder been convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the first paragraph subsequent to the acquisition of land.\n17. Article 38 \u00a7 3 of the Regulations on the Application of Law no. 3083 provides that, in view of the particularities and security of a region and subsequent to obtaining the opinion of the security institutions, the Directorate General is authorised to make amendments in the right holders list prepared by the Commission.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n18. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies given that he had not requested the rectification of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision and that he had not raised an objection to the Gaziantep Administrative Court\u2019s decision to dismiss his request for a stay of execution.\n19. As regards the first part of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected similar objections in previous cases (see, in particular, Da\u011ftekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 70516/01, \u00a7 22, 13 December 2007, and G\u00f6k and Others v. Turkey, nos. 71867/01, 71869/01, 73319/01 and 74858/01, \u00a7\u00a7 47- 48, 27 July 2006). It finds no particular circumstances, in the present application, which would require it to depart from that conclusion. Consequently, it rejects this part of the Government\u2019s objection.\n20. As regards the second limb of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court recalls that, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it may only deal with an issue after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies only requires that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances.\n21. In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s complaint related to the alleged unjust termination of his lease. In this respect, the applicant brought an action in the administrative courts to obtain the annulment of the Directorate General\u2019s decision dated 11 May 2000 and, meanwhile, sought interim measures to secure a stay of execution of that decision. However, the applicant\u2019s requests were dismissed by the Gaziantep Administrative Court. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the fact the applicant did not object to the dismissal of his request for a stay of execution is not material; it is not the case that his claim was thereby rejected for failure to comply with a procedural requirement. Having regard to the fact that the applicant\u2019s case was examined by the domestic courts who delivered a final and binding decision on the matter, the Court concludes that he must be regarded as having exhausted domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and this part of the Government\u2019s objection cannot be upheld.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n##### 1. As regards the length of the proceedings\n22. The applicant alleged that the length of the domestic proceedings exceeded the reasonable time requirement, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n23. The Court notes that the proceedings in question commenced on 11 May 2000 and ended on 15 April 2002. They thus lasted for approximately two years at two levels of jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court concludes that, in the present case, the length of the proceedings cannot be regarded as exceeding the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n##### 2. As regards the fairness of the proceedings\n25. The applicant complained that the failure of the Directorate General to submit the documents pertaining to the annulment of his right holder status to the domestic courts violated his right to a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a) and (b) of the Convention.\n26. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s claim. They submitted that, pursuant to Article 20 \u00a7 3 of the Law on Administrative Procedure, the Prime Minister or other Government Minister may refrain from submitting information or documents to an administrative court if the information or documents in question pertain to the security or vital interests of the State. According to the Government, in the instant case, the administration had used its discretionary power under Article 24 of Law no. 3038 and Article 38 of the Regulations of implementation. Thus, having regard in particular to the security of the region concerned, it had amended the list of right holders.\n27. The Court considers that, in the instant case, it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 globally due to the overlapping nature of the issues and since the sub-paragraphs of Article 6 \u00a7 3, which apply solely in the criminal sphere, may nonetheless sometimes be regarded as general elements of the fairness guarantee of the first paragraph in civil cases.\n#### A. Admissibility\n28. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n29. The Court notes that it has examined a similar case in the past and has concluded that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Da\u011ftekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 31-35). In that case, it observed that the national authorities had cancelled the applicants\u2019 right to lease farm land in south-east Turkey following a security investigation, the results of which were never communicated to the applicants or to the domestic courts. Furthermore, the result of this security investigation had important consequences for the applicants since at no stage of the domestic proceedings were they given an opportunity to learn the reason as to why their contracts had been annulled. Nor were they given an effective opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the annulment of their right holder status.\n30. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the instant case. It notes that, as a result of the impugned security investigation, the applicant was deprived of his right to cultivate the farm land in question, which was the main source of income to sustain his family, and was never given any reasons for the annulment of his contract. Nor was he given an effective opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the annulment of his right holder status, since the results of the security investigation were not communicated to the domestic courts either (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). As a result, the applicant was deprived of sufficient safeguards against any arbitrary action on the part of the authorities (see, Da\u011ftekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 34).\n31. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the non-disclosure of the security investigation report infringed the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Accordingly, there has been a violation of this provision.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant further complained, under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, that, as a result of the unfair decisions of the domestic authorities, he had been deprived of his land which he had leased from the domestic authorities.\n33. The Government submitted that the domestic authorities had not acted arbitrarily in cancelling the applicant\u2019s right holder status. They further argued that the applicant did not have \u201cpossessions\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n34. The Court notes that this complaint is linked to that already examined above and must likewise be declared admissible.\n35. The Court further notes that the main Convention question raised in the instant application was the fairness of the domestic proceedings pursuant to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Having found a violation of this provision (paragraphs 29-31 above), the Court considers that there is no need to make a separate ruling on the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Da\u011ftekin and Others, cited above, \u00a7 39).\n### IV. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n36. On the basis of these same events, the applicant alleged a further violation of his rights protected by Articles 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention.\n37. The Government contested these allegations.\n38. However, the Court finds nothing in the case file which might disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly-ill founded and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n39. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n40. The applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction. Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning the fairness of the proceedings and his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions admissible, and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the fairness of the proceedings;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine separately the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 25 November 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-59527": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF BECK v.

In the proceedings before the Court, the Government drew attention to certain case-law of the Norwegian Supreme Court, according to which a 64-year-old man had been sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and gross embezzlement totalling NOK 5 ,000,000 (Norsk Retstidende \u2013 \u201cRt\u201d1964, p. 773); a man without a previous criminal record had been sentenced to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment for economic crimes, including gross fraud, amounting to NOK 100,000,000 (Rt 1990, p. 641); a person had been sentenced to 4 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 9,500,000 (Rt 1992, p. 106), and a person had been sentenced to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 1,200,000 with respect to over 20 victims (Rt 1992, p. 1016).\nThe applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention, inter alia, to Supreme Court rulings in which a lawyer\u2019s secretary had been sentenced to 1 year and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and embezzlement with respect to NOK 1,100,000 (Rt 1995, p. 1962) and another decision where two men, aged 43 and 28, with previous criminal records, had been sentenced to 8 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross tax fraud amounting to NOK 1,500,000 (Rt 1995, p. 250).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complains that the criminal proceedings against him \u2013 which lasted from the end of January 1987 to 13 September 1994, thus over 7 years and 7 months \u2013 were not concluded within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by a ... tribunal....\u201d\n#### A. Arguments before the Court\n##### 1. The applicant\n19. The applicant maintained that the case was not very complex, no more so than any other case of this nature, and that the delay in the proceedings was not attributable to his own conduct. Any delay caused by Mr D.R.\u2019s escape to Spain should not be counted against the applicant. In his opinion, it should have been possible for the police to interview Mr D.R. between 7 November 1990 and 8 July 1991, while he was detained in Spain. At all times during the investigations the applicant was available for inquiries by the police. Rather, as pointed out by the City Court, the delay was caused by the changes of police investigators in the case. However, this factor was only one of three mitigating circumstances taken into account. The sentence imposed was only a little lower than the average sentence for the kind of offences in question, which could be explained by the factors referred to by the City Court other than the length. Thus, as his sentence had not been sufficiently reduced, it could not be said that he had obtained adequate redress for the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention occasioned by the excessive duration of the proceedings in his case.\n##### 2. The Government\n20. The Government point out that the maximum sentence with respect to the offences for which the applicant was convicted was 9 years\u2019 imprisonment and that, having regard to the seriousness of the proscribed conduct and the suffering inflicted on the aggrieved individuals, the trial court considered that the sentence had to be severe. Considering, inter alia, the length of the proceedings as a mitigating circumstance, the court fixed the sentence at no more than 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. It was clear from the court\u2019s reasoning that the length of the proceedings was a decisive factor in the leniency of the sentence. Thus the mitigation on grounds of length was measurable and could not be viewed as an unverifiable declaration of good intent. Given the level of sentences imposed in comparable cases, one could reasonably assume that in the applicant\u2019s case the mitigating circumstances represented a reduction in sentence of at least 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. At least one year\u2019s reduction was attributable to the length of the proceedings alone, the City Court having attached less importance to the other two mitigating factors. Thus, bearing in mind the aggravating circumstances in the case, the reduction in sentence must be deemed substantial. The applicant was thus afforded adequate redress by the competent national authorities and could not claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n21. In any event, the Government submit that no delay occurred in the proceedings which could justify a finding of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In particular, there were two factors beyond the control of the authorities which had contributed to the length of the proceedings:\nFirstly, one of the two leading figures in the criminal activity concerned and a key witness against the applicant, Mr D.R., had disappeared after the interviews in 1987 and was only arrested in Spain in November 1990 and extradited to Norway in February 1992. Since the charges against the defendants were based on the same facts, it was in the interests of the proper administration of justice to hear the case against all the accused at the same time. In view of the links between the charges against Mr D.R. and the applicant, the delays in the case against the latter were inevitable and fully acceptable.\nSecondly, the proceedings were delayed another 5\u00bd months because counsel for the defendants were unable to start the main hearing on 22 April 1992 as suggested by the City Court and accepted by the prosecution.\n#### B. Court\u2019s assessment\n22. The Court notes that between 4 September 1991, when the criminal proceedings against the applicant were instituted before the City Court, and 13 September 1994, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, his case had been heard at two levels of jurisdiction, including an oral hearing lasting 20 days at first instance and a further hearing on appeal (see paragraphs 12-15 above). The hearing at first instance had initially been scheduled for 22 April 1992 but had, at the request of certain defendants, been postponed until 5 October 1992. It does not appear that there were any periods of inactivity during these proceedings before the national courts which would warrant criticism of the competent authorities.\n23. However, the same cannot be said in respect of the period of over 4 years and 6 months which elapsed from the opening of the criminal investigation at the end of January 1987 until the institution of proceedings before the City Court on 4 September 1991 (see paragraphs 10-12 above).\n24. On this point the Court observes that the investigation concerned over a thousand complaints about a large scale international fraudulent business, based on a sophisticated pyramid scheme involving several thousand persons, and engaged the police authorities of no fewer than four different countries. Parallel to the criminal case, there were also bankruptcy and tax proceedings (see paragraphs 8-10 above). The criminal proceedings required the hearing of oral evidence over 20 days by the City Court (see paragraph 14 above). The Court accepts the Government\u2019s argument that the case was very complex.\n25. As regards the applicant\u2019s conduct, the fact that he moved to Switzerland pending the investigations must have caused some inconvenience to the investigating authorities, even though the police were informed of his address in Switzerland and of his preparedness to go to Oslo if requested to do so (see paragraph 10 above). However, the Court does not find it established that this fact unduly prolonged the proceedings against him.\n26. As regards the conduct of the authorities, the Court observes that there were no periods of inactivity in 1987. Nor does it appear unreasonable for the investigators to have awaited the reports from the bankruptcy and VAT proceedings before completing the police investigation (see paragraph 10 above). Moreover, it is noted that one of the two leading figures in the criminal business in question, Mr D.R., disappeared after the initial interview in 1987 until his arrest by the Spanish police in November 1990. To some extent this fact, which was not the responsibility of the authorities of the respondent State, must have contributed to prolonging the investigation.\nHowever, in the Court\u2019s view, this does not sufficiently explain why it took nearly 2 years from the issue of the formal indictment in August 1989, when \u2013 according to the Government \u2013 the investigation was essentially completed, until the institution of proceedings before the City Court in September 1991 (see paragraph 12 above). In this regard the Court notes that the City Court, after having apprised itself of all the evidence before it, observed that the lateness of the investigation was not so much caused by Mr D.R.\u2019s sojourn abroad as by a change of investigators in the case (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above).\n27. The question remains whether the applicant may continue to claim to be a victim of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on the grounds of the length of the criminal proceedings against him. In this regard the Court recalls that the mitigation of a sentence on the ground of the excessive length of proceedings does not in principle deprive the individual concerned of his status as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. However this general rule is subject to an exception when the national authorities have acknowledged in a sufficiently clear way the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement and have afforded redress by reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner (see the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, \u00a7 66).\n28. Applying these principles in the present case, the Court notes in the first place that the City Court expressly upheld the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time.\nSecondly, the Court is satisfied that the applicant was afforded adequate redress for the alleged violation. On this point it should be recalled that, despite the gravity of the offences in question, the applicant was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment which was at the lower end of the scale of punishment authorised by the relevant penal provisions and appreciably less than in comparable cases (see paragraph 17 above). The Court is not convinced by the applicant\u2019s argument that the length factor had been of minor or negligible importance in the sentencing. The City Court held expressly that it attached a \u201cnot insignificant\u201d weight to this third factor and little weight to a second factor regarding the uncritical attitude of banks in giving loans. The age mitigating factor did not apply to all the defendants, yet they all received comparable sentences according to their respective responsibilities. Thus, the time/delay element stood out as being the primary mitigating factor. Although the City Court\u2019s reasoning could have been more precise, the Court is satisfied, given the particulars on comparable sentencing practices submitted by the parties, that the reduction in sentence on account of the length factor was measurable in the present case, and had a decisive impact on the applicant\u2019s sentence.\n29. Against this background, the Court does not find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 26 June 2001, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n12. A description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Salduz v. Turkey judgment ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 27 November 2008) and G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey judgment ([GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7\u00a7 27-32, ECHR 2002\u2011V).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had not been communicated to him, and that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer while in police custody. Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, in so far as relevant, read as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; ...\u201d\n#### A. The non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation\n14. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had not been communicated to him.\n15. The Government submitted that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor was not binding on the Court of Cassation, as it was free to decide on appeals regardless of the Prosecutor\u2019s opinion. They further maintained that the applicant\u2019s representative had had the right to consult the case file and examine the documents. Finally, the Government pointed out that, on account of the recent amendment of 27 March 2003, Article 316 of the Code of Criminal Procedure now provides that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation must be sent to the parties.\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes in the first place that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n17. It further observes that it has already examined the same grievance in the case of G\u00f6\u00e7 and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-58). In that judgment, the Court held that, having regard to the nature of the principal public prosecutor\u2019s submissions and to the fact that the applicant had not been given an opportunity to make written observations in reply, there had been an infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to adversarial proceedings.\n18. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned G\u00f6c judgment.\n19. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n#### B. Access to a lawyer during police custody\n##### 1. Admissibility\n20. The Government maintained in the first place that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since at no stage of the domestic proceedings did he rely on the fact that he had been deprived of his right to legal assistance during police custody. In the alternative, they stated that this part of the application was introduced outside the six months time-limit, since the applicant\u2019s police custody had ended on 20 April 2000, whereas the application was introduced on 8 December 2001 with the Court.\n21. The Court notes that the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was in accordance with section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. Furthermore, the Court observes from the documents in the case file that, on 20 April 2000, the applicant\u2019s lawyer applied to the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court for permission to see the applicant; however this request was rejected. Moreover, in his petition submitted to the Izmir State Security Court on 4 December 2000, the applicant\u2019s lawyer stated that the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance had constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Convention. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection regarding remedies.\n22. As to the objection concerning the failure of the applicant to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months of the delivery of the final decision by the Court of Cassation. He therefore lodged his application to the Court within the six months time-limit, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In conclusion, this objection cannot be upheld either.\n##### 2. Merits\n23. The applicant stated that the restriction on his right to legal assistance during his police custody had breached his right to a fair trial. He argued that the domestic court judgment was based on his statement given before the investigating judge, which was taken in the absence of a lawyer.\n24. The Government argued that the applicant had been represented by a lawyer during the proceedings and his statement to the investigating judge was not the sole basis for his conviction.\n25. The Court reiterates the basic principles laid down in the case of Salduz (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 50-55). It will examine the present case in the light of those principles.\n26. The Court repeats that, in the present case, the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was systematic and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. Even though the applicant repeatedly denied the content of his statements taken during this initial period of detention, the Izmir State Security Court used his statement taken before the investigating judge for his conviction. Thus, in the present case, the applicant was undoubtedly affected by the restrictions on his access to a lawyer. Therefore, neither the assistance provided subsequently by a lawyer not the adversarial nature of the ensuing proceedings could cure the defects which had occurred earlier.\n27. In sum, even though the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the evidence against him at the trial and subsequently on appeal, the absence of a lawyer while he was in police custody irretrievably affected his defence rights.\n28. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n30. The Court points out that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, \u201cfailing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part\u201d.\n31. In the instant case, the applicant failed to submit his claims for just satisfaction within the prescribed time-limit, and they were not, therefore, admitted to the file.\n32. Nevertheless, where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted in criminal proceedings which were found to be in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant, as far as possible, be put in the position in which he would have been had this provision not been disregarded (see \u015eirin v. Turkey, no. 47328/99, \u00a7 30, 15 March 2005). The Court therefore considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the re-trial of the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should the applicant so request (see, mutatis mutandis, Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003, and Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 72).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in respect of the non-communication to the applicant of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation;\n3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, on account of the lack of legal assistance to the applicant while he was in police custody;\n4. Dismisses the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 February 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-110271": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BALOGUN v.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n16. Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n17. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n18. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n19. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:\n\u201c353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\nA fresh claim, if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of State, and if refused, gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits. If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim, their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim.\n#### B. Relevant case-law\n20. In J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n21. The Court of Appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test. It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3. Fifthly, an important factor in determining whether removal would breach Article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill-treatment in the receiving State, if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide, was objectively well-founded. A fear found not to be objectively well-founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of Article 3. Finally, the Court of Appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and/or receiving States had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide. The existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of Article 3 as a result of removal.\n22. The Court of Appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages, namely, in the United Kingdom, in transit, and in the receiving State. The threshold for Article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving State was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the United Kingdom. In the case of the particular appellant, the Court of Appeal found that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the United Kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities; that the Secretary of State would provide appropriately qualified escorts and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport; and that in light of the finding that the applicant\u2019s fears of return to Sri Lanka were not objectively well-founded, and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that State, the risk of suicide in Sri Lanka would not reach the very high threshold of Article 3.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n24. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. According to the Government, the applicant could have argued that he was a suicide risk and raised Article 3 of the Convention in the context of his appeal against deportation, but did not do so, relying instead only upon Article 8. He could also have raised the fact of his risk of suicide in his application for judicial review but, again, did not do so. He also failed to renew his application for judicial review. The first time that the applicant claimed to be at risk of suicide was in his request to this Court for interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n26. The Government referred to their letter of 2 December 2009 to the Court, which outlined the special protective measures that had been put in place in the detention centre in respect of the applicant, once notice of his previous suicide attempt had been received. The Government stated that, on the one subsequent occasion when concerns had arisen whilst the applicant was detained, namely on 29 December 2009 when he had claimed to have taken an overdose of paracetamol, he had been assessed by a medical team and found not to be in danger. Apart from that incident, the applicant had not attempted suicide in detention or following his release. However, the Government would put in place precautionary measures should the applicant be detained again prior to deportation, and the contractor responsible for his removal would be made aware of the applicant\u2019s circumstances. Special measures would be taken, including a medical escort if necessary, to mitigate any risk of suicide during the removal process and the applicant would be accompanied until the point of arrival in Nigeria. There was sufficient psychiatric treatment available in Nigeria, should the applicant require it. The Government therefore submitted that, given that all reasonable steps had been and would be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of suicide, the applicant had not been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, and nor would his deportation amount to such treatment.\n##### 2. The applicant\n27. The applicant, on the other hand, contended that the risk of suicide had only arisen after his application to revoke the deportation order was refused, and that there had been no right of appeal against this decision. The applicant\u2019s first suicide attempt had taken place on 13 August 2009, which was the same day on which his application for judicial review had been lodged by his representatives. Although no mention of the applicant being at risk of suicide had been made in the judicial review application, he claimed that his representatives had raised this matter in letters to both the Secretary of State and the High Court dated 18 September 2009, but that the letter to the Secretary of State had received no response, and that the High Court, in refusing his judicial review application on 30 October 2009, had not addressed the matter either. As regards the applicant\u2019s failure to renew his application for judicial review, he submitted that he had been apprehended on 10 November 2009 and served with removal directions before he was able to renew the application.\n28. The applicant contended that the Government had been made aware of his attempted suicide on 13 August 2009. He also submitted that he made a further suicide attempt on 11 December 2009 or 29 December 2009 whilst detained in the immigration detention centre. He claimed that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. The Court notes the Government\u2019s preliminary objection and also recalls its finding in NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 90, 17 July 2008 that in expulsion cases judicial review is in principle an effective remedy which applicants should be required to exhaust before applying to this Court. However, the Court considers it unnecessary to rule on whether the present applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this complaint since, in any event, it considers the complaint to be manifestly ill-founded.\n30. It is well-established that expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country. Article 3 is absolute and it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 138, ECHR 2008-...).\n31. The Court further recalls that it has reserved to itself sufficient flexibility to find a violation of Article 3 even where the treatment in question arises not from the intentional acts of public authorities or non-State actors in the receiving State, but from the applicant\u2019s own physical or mental health (see Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2001\u2011I). However, the Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law (see D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011III), aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in principle claim any right to remain in the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of assistance provided by that State, unless such exceptional circumstances pertain as to render the implementation of a decision to remove an alien incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Finally, the Court recalls that in order to violate Article 3, treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. This applies regardless of whether the risk of harm emanates from deliberate acts of State authorities or third parties; from a naturally occurring illness (see N., cited above, \u00a7 29); or even from the applicant himself (see Kharsa v. Sweden, no. 28419/95, Commission\u2019s decision of 26 October 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR)). The Court recalls that in previous cases involving a risk of suicide, it has found not only that the high threshold for Article 3 applies to the same extent as it does in other types of cases, but that appropriate and adequate steps taken by the relevant authorities to mitigate a risk of suicide will weigh against a conclusion that the high threshold of Article 3 has been reached (see Nikovic v. Sweden, no. 28285/95, Commission decision of 7 December 1995, (DR)).\n32. The Court notes that it is the risk to the applicant at the time of the proceedings before the Court that is relevant for the purposes of determining whether his deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above). The Court must therefore examine the situation as it would be were the applicant to be deported at this point in time. In this regard, the Court observes that the Government have set out, in their letter to the Court of 2 December 2009, the precautionary measures that would be taken should the applicant be re-admitted to immigration detention and the deportation order against him enforced. The Government addressed the risk that might arise at three stages: i) when the applicant is notified of the decision to remove him to Nigeria; ii) during his actual removal; and iii) after he has arrived in Nigeria. The Court notes that this is the approach espoused by the Court of Appeal in J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, cited above, and which the Court considers is entirely consistent with the requirements of Article 3.\n33. As to the first stage, the Government state that, if detained and if assessed as being at risk of suicide, the applicant would be put under constant watch and that trained staff, aware of the applicant\u2019s circumstances, would be on hand at the detention centre. As regards the second stage, the Government state that the contractor responsible for executing the applicant\u2019s removal from the United Kingdom to Nigeria would be informed of the risk of suicide, as well as the applicant\u2019s medical history and previous suicide attempts. Suitable escorts trained in suicide and self-harm awareness and prevention and, if necessary, medical escorts, would be provided for the applicant\u2019s flight. The applicant would be accompanied up until the point of arrival in Nigeria. As to the third stage, the Government point out that adequate psychiatric treatment would be available to the applicant, should he require it, in Nigeria. The Government refer in this regard to a fact-finding mission to Nigeria conducted jointly by the United Kingdom Border Agency and the Danish Immigration Service in 2008, the findings of which were, inter alia, that there was psychiatric treatment available throughout the country and that psychiatric hospitals were able to treat all illnesses, including depression and suicidal tendencies. Hospitals were apparently well-staffed and staff well-trained.\n34. The Court finds that, whatever concerns there may be as to the previous handling of the applicant\u2019s case by the Government, the Government are now fully aware of the risk posed by the applicant to himself and can be relied upon to take the steps outlined in paragraph 33. The Court emphasises the high threshold for Article 3, as described in N., cited above, and which applies with equal force in cases involving a risk of suicide as in other cases (see Kharsa, cited above). In the light of the precautions to be taken by the Government and the existence of adequate psychiatric care in Nigeria, should the applicant require it, the Court is unable to find that the applicant\u2019s deportation would result in a real and imminent risk of treatment of such a severity as to reach this threshold. It therefore follows that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 is manifestly ill-founded and thus inadmissible, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT\n35. In view of the above, it is appropriate to discontinue the application of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant further complained that his deportation would breach Article 8 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society...for the prevention of disorder or crime...or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\na) The applicant\n39. The applicant contended that he had been in the United Kingdom continuously since the age of three, with indefinite leave to remain from 2003 until the order for his deportation was signed. He was without home or person to return to in Nigeria. The applicant claimed to enjoy family life in the United Kingdom with his half-brother, with whom he had been living since his release from detention; his aunt, whom he claimed was like a mother to him; and his girlfriend, a British citizen with whom he had been in a relationship since 2005. He also claimed to enjoy private life in the United Kingdom, given his length of residence there, comprising, inter alia, his relationship with his girlfriend and other friendships; his previous studies and employment; and the fact that all of his links were with the United Kingdom rather than with Nigeria. In the light of the young age at which he entered the United Kingdom, his lack of ties to Nigeria and the strength of his ties to the United Kingdom, the applicant contended that his deportation would gravely interfere with both his private and family life.\n40. Furthermore, the applicant submitted that the nature and seriousness of his offending history were not sufficiently grave as to render this interference proportionate for the purposes of Article 8. He pointed in particular to the fact that all of his offences had been committed before his twenty-first birthday and that he had not offended since his release from prison. He had also tested negative for drugs whilst in prison and claimed no longer to be abusing drugs. As regards the risk he posed to the public in terms of future offending, he stated that the Government had not conducted any risk assessment to determine the level of risk of recidivism. However, the applicant claimed to have learnt his lesson and to be determined not to commit further criminal offences in future but to establish a law-abiding life for himself with his girlfriend and resume his studies.\nb) The Government\n41. The Government submitted that the applicant did not enjoy family life in the United Kingdom, being a single adult and not part of any family unit. The Government referred to the findings of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (see paragraph 10 above) with regard to the applicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend, namely that it was not sufficiently settled, serious or long-term to amount to family life.\n42. The Government accepted, on the other hand, that the applicant enjoyed private life in the United Kingdom and that his deportation would represent an interference with that private life. However, that interference would be justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8, being in accordance with law and taken in pursuit of the legitimate aims of protecting public safety, the prevention of crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government also contended that the interference was proportionate given the nature and seriousness of the applicant\u2019s offences, which were, for the most part, drugs offences, which the Government considered to be particularly grave given the issues of public protection that they raised. The Government pointed in particular to the fact that the applicant\u2019s last offence had been of sufficient gravity to attract a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant had committed his offences when he was already an adult and his case could therefore be distinguished from that of the applicant in Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, 23 June 2008, whose offences by contrast could be characterised as \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d. The Government considered the young age at which the applicant had entered the United Kingdom and the fact that he had stronger ties with that country than with Nigeria to be relevant factors, but maintained that his deportation would have a relatively minor impact on the applicant given that he did not have family life in the United Kingdom and could re-establish private life in Nigeria. In this regard, the Government pointed to the applicant\u2019s good health, high intelligence and the fact that he had lived alone since the age of eighteen with little support. As such, and having regard to the importance of protecting the public from drugs-related crime, the Government were of the view that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Nigeria would represent a proportionate interference with his private life in terms of Article 8.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na) General principles\n43. The Court recalls that, as Article 8 protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants such as the applicant and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. Indeed it will be a rare case where a settled migrant will be unable to demonstrate that his or her deportation would interfere with his or her private life as guaranteed by Article 8 (see Miah v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 53080/07, \u00a7 17, 27 April 2010). Not all settled migrants will have equally strong family or social ties in the Contracting State where they reside but the comparative strength or weakness of those ties is, in the majority of cases, more appropriately considered in assessing the proportionality of the applicant\u2019s deportation under Article 8 \u00a7 2. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 63). However, the Court has previously held that there will be no family life between parents and adult children or between adult siblings unless they can demonstrate additional elements of dependence (Slivenko v. Latvia [GC], no. 48321/99, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2003 X; Kwakye-Nti and Dufie v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 31519/96, 7 November 2000).\n44. An interference with a person\u2019s private or family life will be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention unless it can be justified under paragraph 2 of that Article as being \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, as pursuing one or more of the legitimate aims listed therein, and as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve the aim or aims concerned. The Grand Chamber has summarised the relevant criteria to be applied, in determining whether an interference is necessary in a democratic society, at \u00a7\u00a7 57-58 of \u00dcner, cited above:\n\u201cEven if Article 8 of the Convention does not therefore contain an absolute right for any category of alien not to be expelled, the Court\u2019s case\u2011law amply demonstrates that there are circumstances where the expulsion of an alien will give rise to a violation of that provision (see, for example, the judgments in Moustaquim v. Belgium, Beldjoudi v. France and Boultif v. Switzerland, cited above; see also Amrollahi v. Denmark, no. 56811/00, 11 July 2002; Y\u0131lmaz v. Germany, no. 52853/99, 17 April 2003; and Keles v. Germany, 32231/02, 27 October 2005). In the case of Boultif the Court elaborated the relevant criteria which it would use in order to assess whether an expulsion measure was necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. These criteria, as reproduced in paragraph 40 of the Chamber judgment in the present case, are the following:\n- the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant;\n- the length of the applicant\u2019s stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled;\n- the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant\u2019s conduct during that period;\n- the nationalities of the various persons concerned;\n- the applicant\u2019s family situation, such as the length of the marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a couple\u2019s family life;\n- whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship;\n- whether there are children of the marriage, and if so, their age; and\n- the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled.\n58. The Court would wish to make explicit two criteria which may already be implicit in those identified in the Boultif judgment:\n- the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the difficulties which any children of the applicant are likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled; and\n- the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.\u201d\n45. These criteria are relevant, where applicable, regardless of the age of the person concerned or their length of residence in the expelling State, as the Grand Chamber also confirmed in \u00dcner, cited above:\n\u201c55. The Court considers that these principles apply regardless of whether an alien entered the host country as an adult or at a very young age, or was perhaps even born there. In this context the Court refers to Recommendation 1504 (2001) on the non\u2011expulsion of long-term immigrants, in which the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite member States, inter alia, to guarantee that long-term migrants who were born or raised in the host country cannot be expelled under any circumstances (see paragraph 37 above). While a number of Contracting States have enacted legislation or adopted policy rules to the effect that long-term immigrants who were born in those States or who arrived there during early childhood cannot be expelled on the basis of their criminal record (see paragraph 39 above), such an absolute right not to be expelled cannot, however, be derived from Article 8 of the Convention, couched, as paragraph 2 of that provision is, in terms which clearly allow for exceptions to be made to the general rights guaranteed in the first paragraph.\u201d\n46. However, the age of the person is of significant relevance when applying certain of the criteria. For instance, when assessing the nature and seriousness of the offences committed by an applicant, it has to be taken into account whether he or she committed them as a juvenile or as an adult. The age at which the person entered the host country is also of relevance, as is the question of whether they spent a large part or even all of their childhood in that country (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-73). The Court has previously found that for a settled migrant who has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her childhood and youth in the host country, very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion (ibid, \u00a7 75).\nb) Application to the facts of the case\n47. The Court notes that the applicant claims that he enjoys family life in the United Kingdom, whilst the Government deny that assertion. The Court is of the view, having had regard to the findings of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal which heard the applicant\u2019s appeal against deportation, that the applicant\u2019s relationships with his girlfriend and relatives in the United Kingdom do not amount to family life. However, it is clear, and not disputed by the Government, that the applicant enjoys private life in the United Kingdom and that his various relationships form part of, and strengthen, that private life. The Court will therefore consider whether the interference with his private life which would be caused by the applicant\u2019s deportation would infringe Article 8.\n48. The Court further notes that it is not in dispute between the parties that the applicant\u2019s deportation would be \u201cin accordance with law\u201d and in pursuit of a legitimate aim, namely the prevention of crime. It only remains for the Court to determine, therefore, whether the deportation would be \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. Having regard to the criteria expressed by the Grand Chamber in \u00dcner, cited above, and set out at paragraph 44, the Court finds that the following criteria are of relevance in the applicant\u2019s case: i) the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant; ii) the length of the applicant\u2019s stay in the country from which he is to be expelled; iii) the time that has elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant\u2019s conduct during that period; and iv) the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.\n49. Having regard to the first of the relevant criteria, the Court observes that the offence which gave rise to deportation proceedings against the applicant, namely possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply, was undoubtedly very serious, as evidenced by the fact that it gave rise to a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. The Court notes that the Secretary of State takes an especially grave view of offences involving drugs, and accepts that she is entitled to do so, particularly given the destructive effects of such offences on society as a whole (see Dalia v. France, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011I). It is also noted that the deportation offence was not the applicant\u2019s first; he had several previous convictions, some of which were also for drug-related offences. The nature of the applicant\u2019s offending and the fact that, with the exception of the conviction for possession of drugs in February 2004, all of his offences appear to have been committed when he was over the age of eighteen and hence, an adult, mean that his case can clearly be distinguished from that of the applicant in Maslov, cited above. In that case, the applicant\u2019s offences could be characterised as \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d, but Mr Balogun\u2019s offences merit far more serious characterisation. The Court does, however, observe, with regard to the third of the relevant criteria listed above, that the applicant does not appear to have committed any further offences since his release from prison.\n50. Turning now to the second of the criteria listed above, namely the applicant\u2019s length of stay in the United Kingdom, the Court observes that this is a matter of some dispute. Whilst the applicant has always maintained that he was brought to the United Kingdom at the age of three and has remained there since, the Government reject this claim, stating that there is no record of the applicant being present in the United Kingdom until he was eight years old. The Court notes that even the application for leave to remain made on behalf of the applicant by social services stated that he had arrived at the age of three. This was long before the issue of the applicant\u2019s deportation arose. The Court therefore takes the view that the applicant\u2019s consistency as to the age at which he entered the country outweighs the lack of documentary evidence of his presence, and therefore accepts that he has been in the United Kingdom since he was three. Furthermore, while the Court notes the Government\u2019s point that regardless of how long the applicant has been in the United Kingdom, only four years of his stay were with valid leave, the Court is of the view that the applicant, given the young age at which he was brought into the country and the unfortunate circumstances of his childhood, should not be penalised for his guardians\u2019 failure to regularise his status earlier. Given that the applicant can be classed as a settled migrant who has spent virtually the whole of his childhood in the host country, the Court finds that very serious reasons would be required to justify his expulsion (see Maslov, cited above, \u00a7 75).\n51. Finally, the Court has given close scrutiny to the fourth of the criteria listed above, namely the respective solidity of the applicant\u2019s ties to the host country and the destination country. The main tie to Nigeria that the applicant may have, given the young age at which he left the country and consequent lack of memories or cultural experience, is the fact that his mother appears to reside there. The applicant claims not to be in contact with his mother or to have any knowledge of her whereabouts, and given that he does not appear to have lived with her since his arrival in the United Kingdom, the Court accepts that this is not a strong familial tie. However, it is one that could be pursued and strengthened by the applicant if he chose. The remainder of the applicant\u2019s relatives, namely, his half brother, the aunt with whom he lived as a child \u2013 and from whom it is presumed the applicant is now estranged \u2013 and a second aunt and her family, reside in the United Kingdom and have settled immigration status. His father is deceased. The applicant\u2019s family ties in both the United Kingdom and Nigeria can therefore be characterised as limited. The Court is, however, of the view that his social and cultural ties to his host country are undoubtedly stronger than those to Nigeria, given his length of residence in the United Kingdom, the fact that he has both studied and worked there and his relationship, now of several years\u2019 duration, with his girlfriend.\n52. The Court has taken note, in assessing the applicant\u2019s respective ties to the United Kingdom and Nigeria, of the specific circumstances of his upbringing. He was left at the age of three with an aunt who, according to the applicant and to social services, ill-treated the applicant. He was thrown out by this aunt at the age of fifteen and was thereafter taken into foster care. He has therefore not only spent by far the greater part of his childhood in the United Kingdom and been entirely educated in that country, but has been partly brought up in the care of the United Kingdom\u2019s social services. These elements of the applicant\u2019s background contribute significantly to the Court\u2019s finding that his ties to the United Kingdom are stronger than those to Nigeria. However, while the Court views with sympathy the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s formative years, the fact remains that he is responsible for his own actions. Particularly in light of the fact that the majority of the applicant\u2019s offences were committed when he was already an adult, the Court finds that the applicant cannot excuse his past criminal conduct by reference to his upbringing.\n53. As previously stated, very strong reasons are required to justify the deportation of settled migrants. In the case of this particular applicant, moreover, it is not in doubt that his deportation to Nigeria will have a very serious impact on his private life, given his length of residence in the United Kingdom and his limited ties to his country of origin. However, the Court has paid specific regard to the applicant\u2019s history of repeated, drugs-related offending and the fact that the majority of his offending was committed when he was an adult, and also to the careful and appropriate consideration that has been given to the applicant\u2019s case by the domestic authorities. With these factors in mind, the Court finds that the interference with the applicant\u2019s private life caused by his deportation would not be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case. It therefore follows that his deportation to Nigeria would not amount to a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Declares unanimously the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds by five votes to two that there would be no violation of Article 8 of the Convention if the applicant were to be deported to Nigeria.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 10 April 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge De Gaetano and the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Garlicki and David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson are annexed to this judgment.\n#### L.G.\nT.L.E.\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE DE GAETANO\n1. I have voted, not without some misgivings, with the majority in this case. The reason for my initial hesitation is that the instant case is not easily reconcilable with, and not convincingly distinguishable from, cases like Nunez v. Norway (28 June 2011, no. 55597/09) and A.A. v. the United Kingdom (20 September 2011, no. 8000/08) if these cases are viewed solely from the perspective of the doctrine of the margin of appreciation. In Nunez all the facts were before the Norwegian judicial authorities who gave relevant and sufficient reasons for their decision to uphold Mrs Nunez\u2019s expulsion. Likewise in A.A. all the facts were before the Immigration Tribunals and the Court of Appeal, and it was not for a moment suggested that these had erred in law or in fact (although in A.A. the UK Border Agency dragged its feet for more than two and a half years after the decision of the Court of Appeal).\n2. The reality is, however, that no one case is identical to another. When applying the principle of proportionality, in order to decide whether the impugned (expulsion) measure is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d, the various criteria set out in \u00dcner v. the Netherlands ([GC] 18 October 2006, no 46410/99, at \u00a7\u00a7 54-58) and Maslov v. Austria ([GC] 23 June 2008, no 1638/03, at \u00a7 71) all exert a different gravitational pull such that it is often difficult to decide on which side the scales should tip. Factor in also the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d (as was the case in Nunez) and the case can spiral out of orbit (see also the joint dissenting opinion in Antwi and Others v. Norway (14 February 2012, no. 26940/10)).\n3. In my view the decisive factor in the instant case is the seriousness of the offences committed after the applicant had become an adult. The applicant knew perfectly well that, although he could be considered as a settled migrant, as an alien he had no \u201cabsolute right\u201d to stay in the United Kingdom, and he must have known that in the event of serious brushes with the law, he risked being expelled. As was pointed out in Maslov \u201c...Article 8 provides no absolute protection against expulsion for any category of aliens...including those who were born in the host country or moved there in their early childhood...\u201d (\u00a7 74). The applicant simply brought the expulsion upon himself \u2013 imputet sibi. Article 8 should not be construed as an automatic safety valve for overriding immigration control on general (as opposed to specific and compelling) compassionate grounds or where there would be some harshness resulting from removal.\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES GARLICKI AND\nDAVID TH\u00d3R BJ\u00d6RGVINSSON\nWe have voted with the majority as concerns the inadmissibility of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, we agree, like the majority, with the findings of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal that his relationship with his girlfriend and the presence of his relatives in the United Kingdom do not amount to family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention (see \u00a7 47). However, we disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that there would be no violation of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his private life if he were to be deported to Nigeria.\nIt is pointed out in \u00a748 of the judgment that the following represent the relevant criteria to be applied to the case: i) the nature and seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant; ii) the length of the applicant\u2019s stay in the United Kingdom; iii) the time that has elapsed since the date of the applicant\u2019s last offence and his conduct during that period; and iv) the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.\nAs regards the first point it is clear that the applicant has a history of offending. This is an important element justifying his deportation from the United Kingdom. However, according to the case file the applicant\u2019s date of birth is 5 April 1986, which means that he turned 18 on 5 April 2004. Two of the convictions were in 2004, one - possession of Class A and C drugs - occurred in February 2004, before he was 18, and the other - handling stolen goods - two days after he turned 18. However, from the record of his convictions it transpires that both offences were actually committed in 2003, when he was still a minor. As regards the dates on which the offences were committed and for which he was convicted in 2005 and 2007, we can only assume they were committed after he had turned 18, especially the 2007 conviction. Whatever the exact dates, it clearly transpires that all offences were in any event committed when the applicant was still a very young man and three of them when he was still a minor.\nAs regards the second point we simply emphasise that the applicant entered the United Kingdom at the age of three. We agree with the majority\u2019s finding in \u00a7 50 that the applicant is a settled migrant who has spent virtually all his childhood and adult life in the United Kingdom. We agree, moreover, with the majority that under these circumstances very serious reasons would be required to justify his expulsion from the United Kingdom.\nAs regards the third point we simply point out that at least five years have elapsed since the applicant last offended. Moreover, there is nothing in the file to indicate that his conduct has not been good since then, both during the three-year period he spent in prison and the two years that have elapsed after he completed his sentence.\nAs regards the fourth point we believe that there can be little doubt that the applicant\u2019s ties with the United Kingdom are much stronger than with Nigeria. Indeed, we believe that the applicant, having spent virtually all his life in the United Kingdom and with little recollection of time spent in Nigeria, has no meaningful social, cultural or familial ties with that country. In this regard we find the arguments advanced in \u00a7 51 as regards the applicant\u2019s possibilities to pursue and strengthen \u201cfamilial ties\u201d with his mother, with whom he has not been in any contact from the age of three, if not longer, to be highly speculative and artificial. Moreover, we would like to add that we find it somewhat contradictory to suggest as relevant possible limited \u201cfamilial ties\u201d with his mother in Nigeria, since such ties would not be accepted as relevant \u201cfamilial ties\u201d under Article 8 of the Convention had his mother been living in the United Kingdom. These ties, if they existed, could not be used by the applicant to support his claim to be allowed to stay in that country, unless some additional elements of dependence could be established (see \u00a7 43 of the judgment). Therefore, we fully agree with what is said in \u00a7 53 of the judgment, namely that there is no doubt that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Nigeria will have a very serious impact on his private life.\nIn sum we believe, having in mind the young age at which the offences were committed, the strong ties the applicant has with the United Kingdom and the corresponding lack of ties with Nigeria, and the overall and very serious impact deportation will have on the applicant, that his right to respect for his private life under Article 8 of the Convention would be breached if he were to be deported to Nigeria.", "001-170347": "\ufeff\nGRAND CHAMBER\nCASE OF HUTCHINSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 57592/08)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n17 January 2017\nThis judgment is final but it may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber), sitting as a Grand Chamber composed of:\nAndr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3, President,\nI\u015f\u0131l Karaka\u015f,\nJosep Casadevall,\nLuis L\u00f3pez Guerra,\nMirjana Lazarova Trajkovska,\nAngelika Nu\u00dfberger,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nGanna Yudkivska,\nPaulo Pinto de Albuquerque,\nLinos-Alexandre Sicilianos,\nErik M\u00f8se,\nHelena J\u00e4derblom,\nPaul Mahoney,\nFaris Vehabovi\u0107,\nKsenija Turkovi\u0107,\nBranko Lubarda,\nYonko Grozev, judges,\nand Johan Callewaert, Deputy Grand Chamber Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 October 2015 and 10 October 2016,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts). At the hearing in the present case, the Government indicated that there were on that date 56 prisoners serving whole life sentences. No prisoner in this category has been released since the date of the Vinter judgment.\n#### A. The Human Rights Act 1998\n14. The Human Rights Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201cSection 2 - Interpretation of Convention rights.\n(1) A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any\u2014\n(a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights,\n...\nSection 3 - Interpretation of legislation.\n(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\n...\nSection 6 - Acts of public authorities.\n(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\u2014\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\n(3) In this section \u201cpublic authority\u201d includes\u2014\n(a) a court or tribunal, and\n(b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,\nbut does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.\n...\nSection 7 - Proceedings.\n(1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may\u2014\n(a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or\n(b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,\nbut only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.\n...\nSection 8 - Judicial remedies.\n(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\n...\u201d\n#### B. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997\n15. Section 30 of the Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\u201d\n#### C. Prison Service Order 4700\n16. The policy of the Secretary of State for Justice on the exercise of the power of release on compassionate grounds is set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued as Prison Service Order 4700. The criteria, as formulated in April 2010, provide as follows:\n\u201cthe prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stoke;\nand\nthe risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\nfurther imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\nthere are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\nearly release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family\u201d.\n#### D. Court of Appeal decision in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin\n17. A special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear these appeals, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge. It gave its decision (\u201cMcLoughlin\u201d) on 18 February 2014, in light of the judgment of this Court in the Vinter case.\n18. The appellant Newell challenged as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention the whole life order imposed on him for a murder committed while he was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder. The McLoughlin case took the form of a reference by the Attorney General under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1986, who contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The trial judge had instead imposed a life sentence with a tariff of forty years for a murder committed by a man with previous convictions for murder and manslaughter.\n19. In its decision, the Court of Appeal traced the development of the whole life sentence and the review of such sentences. It stated at paragraph 7 (citations omitted):\n\u201ci) On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (...).\n\u201cIn addition, I have decided that for those life sentence prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by their remaining in prison for the whole of their life, there will in future be an additional ministerial review when the prisoner has been in custody for 25 years. The purpose of this review will be solely to consider whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a tariff of a determinate period. The review will be confined to the considerations of retribution and deterrence. Where appropriate, further ministerial reviews will normally take place at five-yearly intervals thereafter. Existing prisoners who fall into this category and who have already served 25 years or more in custody will not be disadvantaged. Their cases will be reviewed by ministers as soon as is practicable and after any representations they may wish to make.\u201d\nii) That policy was modified by a different Home Secretary on 10 November 1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written answer):\n\u201cSo far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.\u201d\niii) In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley [...] that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was unlawful, this had been corrected by the 1997 policy which permitted the taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison. In the appeal to the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of exceptional circumstances (...) Lord Steyn, when approving the legality of the Home Secretary\u2019s 1997 policy, recorded the way in which the policy had been clarified (...):\n\u201c.... counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the policy of imposing a whole life tariff merely involves the expression of the current view of the Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution and deterrence make it inappropriate ever to release such a prisoner. It does not rule out reconsideration. The Secretary of State envisages the possibility of release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of State is prepared to reconsider any whole life tariff decision from time to time.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal then set out the relevant criteria of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), commenting that these were \u201chighly restrictive\u201d (paragraph 11 of the McLoughlin decision). It raised the question whether the statutory scheme was compatible with Article 3. In answering the question, it stated:\n\u201c(b) Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life order is imposed?\n19. The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self-evident, that there is no violation of Article 3 if a prisoner in fact spends the whole of his life in prison. One example is an offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life.\n20. However, the Grand Chamber considered that the justification for detention might shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might cease to be just after the passage of many years. It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of its judgment that for a life sentence to be compatible with Article 3, there must therefore be both a prospect of release and a possibility of review. It added at paragraph 122:\n\u201cA whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d\n21. It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124:\n\u201cHowever, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.\u201d\n22. Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a whole life order as just punishment, it concluded that a legal regime for a review during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed.\n23. Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the Strasbourg Court did not determine that the imposition of a whole life tariff itself violates Article 3, we return briefly to the arguments advanced contingently on the hypothesis that it did. In our judgment section 3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs. That is because section 269(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion that no order for early release should be made because of the seriousness of the offence alone or in combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply. That being so, section 6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public authority to act compatibly with the Convention.\n24. The only remedy available in the domestic courts on this hypothesis would be a declaration of incompatibility, the discretionary remedy available under section 4 of the Human Rights Act when primary legislation is found to be incompatible with the Convention. Such a remedy is not available in the Crown Court and would not, in any event, affect the continuing operation of the statutory scheme.\n(c) Is the regime under section 30 a regime for reducibility which is in fact compliant with Article 3?\n25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of section 30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under section 30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u201cAt present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u201d\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of section 30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u201cThe fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his section 30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u201d\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that section 30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u201cAt the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.\u201d\n29. We disagree. In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to \u201cpossible exceptional release of whole life prisoners\u201d. As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to exercise his power under section 30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.\n30. As we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that the policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence. It is important, therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is.\n31. First, the power of review under the section arises if there are exceptional circumstances. The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that although the whole life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances have since arisen. It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is of itself sufficiently certain.\n32. Second, the Secretary of State must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds. The policy set out in the Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will be considered by the Secretary of State. The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds. He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the Lifer Manual. In the passages in Hindley to which we have referred at paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions of section 30 of the 1997 Act, require the Secretary of State to take into account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds.\n33. Third, the term \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d must be read, as the court made clear in R v Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3. They are not restricted to what is set out in the Lifer Manual. It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis.\n34. Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review.\n35. In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender \u201chope\u201d or the \u201cpossibility\u201d of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\n36. It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable. We find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life. But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases. The interpretation of section 30 we have set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of exceptional release.\nConclusion\n37. Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the CJA 2003 and in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 21. Although we were told by Mr Eadie QC that it might be many years before the applications might be made under section 30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer justifiable penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would not discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n20. The Court makes reference to the materials referred to in the Vinter judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 59-81). It refers in particular to one of the Council of Europe texts mentioned there, Recommendation Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on conditional release (parole). This provides, as relevant:\n\u201cDiscretionary release system\n16. The minimum period that prisoners have to serve to become eligible for conditional release should be fixed in accordance with the law.\n17. The relevant authorities should initiate the necessary procedure to enable a decision on conditional release to be taken as soon as the prisoner has served the minimum period.\n18. The criteria that prisoners have to fulfil in order to be conditionally released should be clear and explicit. They should also be realistic in the sense that they should take into account the prisoners\u2019 personalities and social and economic circumstances as well as the availability of resettlement programmes.\n...\n20. The criteria for granting conditional release should be applied so as to grant conditional release to all prisoners who are considered as meeting the minimum level of safeguards for becoming law-abiding citizens. It should be incumbent on the authorities to show that a prisoner has not fulfilled the criteria.\n21. If the decision-making authority decides not to grant conditional release it should set a date for reconsidering the question. In any case, prisoners should be able to reapply to the decision-making authority as soon as their situation has changed to their advantage in a substantial manner.\n...\n### VIII. Procedural safeguards\n32. Decisions on granting, postponing or revoking conditional release, as well as on imposing or modifying conditions and measures attached to it, should be taken by authorities established by law in accordance with procedures covered by the following safeguards:\na. convicted persons should have the right to be heard in person and to be assisted according to the law;\nb. the decision-making authority should give careful consideration to any elements, including statements, presented by convicted persons in support of their case;\nc. convicted persons should have adequate access to their file;\nd. decisions should state the underlying reasons and be notified in writing.\n33. Convicted persons should be able to make a complaint to a higher independent and impartial decision-making authority established by law against the substance of the decision as well as against non-respect of the procedural guarantees.\u201d\n21. The Court also refers to the 2006 European Prison Rules, in particular Rule 30.3 which provides:\n\u201cPrisoners shall be informed about any legal proceedings in which they are involved and, if they are sentenced, the time to be served and the possibilities of early release.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that his whole life order violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. The Chamber judgment\n23. The Chamber noted that the Government initially considered themselves not to be in a position to submit observations on the merits of the case, as they recognised that the principles set out in the Vinter case were applicable. The Government changed their stance following the McLoughlin decision, arguing that a whole life sentence was now to be regarded as reducible. The Chamber examined the McLoughlin decision and recalled that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic law. It further observed that it was a well\u2011entrenched and necessary part of the legal tradition of the United Kingdom to develop the law through judicial interpretation. As the Court of Appeal had specifically addressed the doubts raised in Vinter regarding the clarity of the applicable domestic law, and set out an unequivocal statement of the legal position, that interpretation had to be accepted by the European Court. It concluded that the power of release under section 30 of the 1997 Act, exercised in the manner delineated in McLoughlin, was sufficient to comply with the requirements of Article 3.\n#### B. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n24. The Government agreed with the Chamber judgment. They maintained that the Court of Appeal had set out, authoritatively and conclusively, the operation of domestic law in clear and unequivocal terms. By virtue of sections 3 and 6 of the Human Rights Act, section 30 of the 1997 Act had to be interpreted and applied broadly enough so as to comply with Article 3 in every case. The Lifer Manual did not and could not restrict or in any way fetter this obligation. Therefore, as the Court of Appeal had stated, the fact that the text of the Manual had not been revised was of no legal consequence. The Manual remained valid inasmuch as it laid out the approach to be taken where release was sought on grounds of advanced terminal illness or severe incapacity. The McLoughlin decision had further clarified that the Secretary of State was obliged under domestic law to consider all relevant circumstances of each case in a manner compatible with Article 3 \u2013 there was no remaining unclarity as to the law in this regard. Section 30 operated in precisely the way that the Vinter judgment had held would be sufficient to satisfy with the requirements of Article 3.\n25. As for the basis for the Secretary of State\u2019s review of sentence, it was clear that the term used in section 30, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, encompassed exceptional progress towards rehabilitation. The relevant yardstick in the Secretary of State\u2019s review would be that stated in Vinter, i.e. whether there had been any changes in the life of the prisoner and such progress towards rehabilitation that continued detention could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. A whole life prisoner therefore knew what he must do to have a prospect of release, and what criteria would apply to the review. No greater specificity was required; it was neither necessary nor practicable to seek to lay down in greater detail what a prisoner must be able to demonstrate to be considered for release or reduction of sentence. The European Court itself had not identified specific criteria in its Article 3 case law, but expressed itself in more general terms. In every individual case, therefore, all the relevant circumstances of the prisoner would be taken into account. This permitted the necessary flexibility in the review, adapting it to each set of individual circumstances.\n26. The domestic law was both accessible and foreseeable for prisoners. It was enough that they sought legal advice, which was available to them, or asked the prison administration, and they would receive an explanation of the applicable legal provisions. To every request the Secretary of State was required to give a reasoned response, which would be subject to judicial review. That review would not merely react to the decisions of the Secretary of State, but would bear on the merits of the case. The procedure had the capacity to develop the practical working out of the relevant considerations in this context, such as what amounted to a legitimate penological ground. Nor would successful judicial review merely mean the Secretary of State taking the decision again. It was within the power of the courts to directly order the release of a prisoner, if this was warranted.\n27. Regarding the timing of the review, the Government recalled that Vinter had regarded this matter as being within the margin of appreciation of the domestic authorities, which should not now be narrowed. That judgment did not prescribe a review after twenty-five years, but simply observed that the comparative and international materials reflected clear support for this particular arrangement. In any event, identifying such a timeframe was more relevant to a system which did not provide for a review for a very long period, which was not the case in the domestic system. Legal certainty did not require a specific time constraint on sentence review, when that review was premised on the ability of the prisoner to make a case that their detention was no longer justified. This they could do at any time; they were not obliged to wait an indeterminate number of years. That could be regarded as more advantageous to the prisoner than being required to serve a long, minimum term of years before being permitted to apply for review. Regarding the circumstances of the applicant, they noted that he had not suggested at any stage that there was no legitimate penological ground for his continued detention. There was nothing to stop him applying to the Secretary of State at any time in the future for a review of sentence.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant disagreed with the Chamber judgment, which he criticised as being inconsistent with Vinter, as well as with other cases decided by this Court since that judgment. He considered that the situation in domestic law remained contrary to Article 3, the McLoughlin decision having failed to remedy the deficiencies identified in Vinter. The Court of Appeal had proceeded on the incorrect assumption that the European Court was mistaken in its analysis of domestic law. Consequently, McLoughlin had merely sought to correct that perceived error, without developing the de jure situation. The review of whole life sentences was still based on a vague discretion vested in a Government minister. He considered that the Court should now rule that such a function must be entrusted to judges not politicians, this proposition finding clear support in the relevant international and comparative materials referred to in Vinter, and being implicit in the Vinter reasoning itself. He drew an analogy in this respect with the evolution that took place both in domestic case-law and Convention case-law requiring the removal of any role for the executive in the determination of sentences. Even if executive review could still be accepted in principle, the domestic system was deficient since the review was conducted by a partisan political figure, as illustrated by public remarks made by the then-Secretary of State following the McLoughlin decision. The procedure therefore did not offer any prospect of fairness, balance and certainty.\n29. The McLoughlin decision had indicated that the statutory terminology was to be given a broad meaning, but this should not be regarded as sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 3, as laid down in Vinter and subsequent judgments of this Court. The meaning of the terms \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d had not been elucidated. Greater specificity was required for the sake of legal certainty; without it, a prisoner\u2019s motivation to attempt rehabilitation would be completely undermined. The only detailed point of reference for whole life prisoners remained the Lifer Manual, the restrictive wording of which had been criticised in Vinter.\n30. Concerning the timing of the review, this issue was still affected by legal uncertainty. It was not stipulated in any legal provision, and had not been addressed in the McLoughlin decision. Whole life prisoners had no clarity as to when their sentences would be reviewed. The applicant recalled that prior to 2003, such sentences were systematically reviewed after twenty-five years, and that the proposal had been made in Parliament (a proposal put forward by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2013 and debated in the House of Lords in 2014) to reintroduce this practice via legislation. The Court\u2019s post-Vinter cases confirmed that a specific timeframe must be provided for in domestic law. Were the Court to now find no violation of Article 3, this would cause chaos in the relevant Convention case-law.\n31. Nor had the situation improved de facto since the Vinter judgment. The applicant criticised the Government\u2019s refusal to revise the Lifer Manual despite the criticism expressed by this Court and subsequently by the Court of Appeal. As a matter of fact, no whole life prisoner had ever been released in the way envisaged in Vinter. It could only discourage such prisoners from making the huge effort required to achieve rehabilitation to know that ultimately their fate would be decided by political decision, rather than an independent and impartial judge.\n32. The applicant further submitted that the system of sentence review should not be treated as falling within the margin of appreciation of the respondent State. This was, first, because of the absolute nature of Article 3. Further, to find a violation in the present case would not impose any particular solution on the United Kingdom. The domestic system had included a twenty-five year review in the past, which could easily be re\u2011introduced and entrusted to the Parole Board. This was not in any way complicated, as the legislative proposal made in Parliament showed. A violation would not mean that the whole life order as such was contrary to the Convention \u2013 the requirement was that it be reducible. Nor would it mean that the applicant should be released; this was a quite separate issue to be assessed elsewhere at another time.\n##### 3. The third party intervener\n33. The EPLN underlined the need for the law relating to the consideration of the release of whole life prisoners to be clear, foreseeable and accessible to those affected by it. Imposing an irreducible life sentence could no longer be regarded as a matter within the margin of appreciation of States, since Article 3 required reducibility. It was only regarding certain details of the requisite review that the State could claim a margin of appreciation, although it was ultimately for the Court to determine whether the review included the necessary procedural safeguards, having regard to the international consensus in this area and the great importance of what is at stake for the prisoner. Any margin available should be narrow.\n34. Referring to the relevant international instruments cited in the Vinter judgment, the EPLN argued that purely punitive or retributory sentencing is not compatible with human rights principles. Rehabilitation must be at the heart of sentencing, implying some prospect of release for life prisoners. For this to be a realistic prospect, there must be sentence planning, the opportunity to progress through the prison system, and structured reviews. The relevant international instruments identified certain basic procedural standards, demanding clarity and foreseeability as regards the timing of the review and the criteria governing it. These points had been endorsed in the Vinter judgment. In subsequent cases they had been reiterated and further developed. It was not just a question of rehabilitating the prisoner, but a matter of personal safety as well. A prisoner with no real prospect of ever being released risked the destruction of his personality, posing real danger to himself and to those in contact with him in the prison environment. To illustrate this point, a statement from a serving life prisoner was also submitted.\n35. The EPLN submitted that the Vinter judgment was not based on any misunderstanding of the domestic system, but had correctly revealed its shortcomings, i.e. the lack of a fixed timeframe and clear, published criteria. No steps had been taken domestically to develop the review into something more than mere compassionate release, already held to be insufficient. This stood in contrast to German constitutional law, cited in Vinter, which held that the preconditions for release and the procedures must be stipulated in law. The Court of Appeal had failed to identify and embed the essential procedural requirements of Article 3 in domestic law.\n36. The statutory duty on the Secretary of State to act compatibly with Article 3 was not sufficient, as it only concerned the point in time when the review took place. It had no bearing on the processes and procedures that must be in place prospectively. There were still no clear published criteria at the domestic level, nor any specific timeframe, contrary to foreseeability and legal certainty, and to the emerging international consensus. Nor were any procedural safeguards provided for, such as disclosure, the right to make oral representations at a review hearing, or the right to be given the reasons for a negative decision. It had not been shown that, notwithstanding these flaws, the system in fact operated in a Convention-compliant way.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n37. The parties\u2019 submissions were confined to the issue whether, in light of the McLoughlin ruling, the applicant\u2019s situation in relation to his whole life sentence is in keeping with the requirements of Article 3 as these were laid down in the Vinter judgment (Vinter and Others, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 123\u2011131). In this connection, the Court will examine, first, whether the unclarity in the domestic law has now been dispelled, and, if so, whether the relevant requirements are now met in the applicant\u2019s case. No separate examination will be made as to a possible violation of Article 3 in the period of the applicant\u2019s imprisonment prior to the McLoughlin ruling.\n##### 1. Whether the domestic law has been clarified\n38. In Vinter, the Court considered that section 30 of the 1997 Act could, by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above), be read as imposing a duty on the Secretary of State to release a whole life prisoner where it could be shown that continued detention was no longer compatible with Article 3, for example where it could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. It noted that this was the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal in the Bieber and Oakes cases, which would be consistent with the requirements of Article 3 as these were set down in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008. However, in addition to the relevant judicial dicta the Court also had regard to the published official policy and to the application of the law in practice to whole life prisoners. It found that the policy set out by the Secretary of State in the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above) was too restrictive to comply with the Kafkaris principles. It further pointed out that the Lifer Manual gave whole life prisoners only a partial picture of the conditions in which the power of release might be exercised. It concluded that the contrast between section 30, interpreted by the domestic courts in a Convention\u2011compliant manner, and the narrow terms of the Lifer Manual meant such a lack of clarity in the law that the whole life sentence could not be regarded as reducible for the purposes of Article 3.\n39. In the McLoughlin decision the Court of Appeal responded explicitly to the Vinter critique. It affirmed the statutory duty of the Secretary of State to exercise the power of release compatibly with Article 3 of the Convention. As for the published policy, which it too regarded as highly restrictive (at paragraphs 11 and 32 of McLoughlin, see paragraph 19 above), the Court of Appeal clarified that the Lifer Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release under section 30. Nor can the published policy fetter the Secretary of State\u2019s discretion by taking account only of the matters stipulated in the Lifer Manual. The failure to revise official policy so as to align it with the relevant statutory provisions and case law is, the Court of Appeal explained, of no consequence as a matter of domestic law.\n40. The Court considers that the Court of Appeal has brought clarity as to the content of the relevant domestic law, resolving the discrepancy identified in the Vinter judgment. Although Vinter contemplated that the policy might be replaced or quashed in the course of judicial review proceedings (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 129), the Court notes the Government\u2019s submission that the Lifer Manual retains its validity in relation to release on compassionate (in the narrow sense of humanitarian) grounds. What is important is that, as confirmed in McLoughlin, this is just one of the circumstances in which the release of a prisoner may, or indeed must, be ordered (see paragraphs 32-33 of McLoughlin at paragraph 19 above).\n41. Having satisfied itself that the applicable domestic law has been clarified, the Court will now pursue its analysis of it.\n##### 2. Whether the domestic law meets the requirements of Article 3\na. General principles established in the Court\u2019s case law on life sentences\n42. The relevant principles, and the conclusions to be drawn from them, are set out at length in the Vinter judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-122; recently summarised in Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100, ECHR 2016). The Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence on those convicted of especially serious crimes, such as murder. Yet to be compatible with Article 3 such a sentence must be reducible de jure and de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review. The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner. These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. The balance between them is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of a sentence, so that the primary justification for detention at the outset may not be so after a lengthy period of service of sentence. The importance of the ground of rehabilitation is underlined, since it is here that the emphasis of European penal policy now lies, as reflected in the practice of the Contracting States, in the relevant standards adopted by the Council of Europe, and in the relevant international materials (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-81).\n43. As recently stated by the Court, in the context of Article 8 of the Convention, \u201cemphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration has become a mandatory factor that the member States need to take into account in designing their penal policies\u201d (Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2015; see also the cases referred to in Murray, cited above, \u00a7 102). Similar considerations apply under Article 3, given that respect for human dignity requires prison authorities to strive towards a life sentenced prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104). It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113\u2011116). A review limited to compassionate grounds is therefore insufficient (ibid., \u00a7 127).\n44. The criteria and conditions laid down in domestic law that pertain to the review must have a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty, and also reflect the relevant case-law of the Court. Certainty in this area is not only a general requirement of the rule of law but also underpins the process of rehabilitation which risks being impeded if the procedure of sentence review and the prospects of release are unclear or uncertain. Therefore prisoners who receive a whole life sentence are entitled to know from the outset what they must do in order to be considered for release and under what conditions. This includes when a review of sentence will take place or may be sought (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122). In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68, 118, 119 and 120). It has however also indicated that this is an issue coming within the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States in the matters of criminal justice and sentencing (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104, 105 and 120).\n45. As for the nature of the review, the Court has emphasised that it is not its task to prescribe whether it should be judicial or executive, having regard to the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 120). It is therefore for each State to determine whether the review of sentence is conducted by the executive or the judiciary.\nb. Application of these principles\ni. Nature of review\n46. In England and Wales the review of sentence is entrusted to the Secretary of State. The applicant submitted that this was wrong in principle, arguing that the review ought to be judicial in nature. He further argued that systems of presidential clemency should be distinguished from the domestic system on the ground that State Presidents can be regarded, by the nature of their office, as non-partisan figures who are above the political fray and thus less susceptible to the pressures of public opinion. Entrusting sentence review to a Government minister left little hope for fair, thorough and consistent assessment of the grounds for releasing a whole life prisoner.\n47. The Court observes that a judicial procedure brings with it a series of important guarantees: the independence and impartiality of the decider, procedural safeguards and protection against arbitrariness. In two cases, the Court found that due to the existence of a judicial procedure of sentence review the domestic law was in keeping with Article 3 of the Convention (see \u010ca\u010dko v. Slovakia, no. 49905/08, 22 July 2014, and Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, 13 November 2014).\n48. In the Bodein case, the Court discounted the power of presidential clemency (cited above, at \u00a7 59). Similar systems in Hungary and Bulgaria were likewise found not to meet the requisite standard: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar v. Hungary, no. 73593/10, 20 May 2014, and Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts) (referring to the system of presidential clemency in the period up to January 2012). However, it was because of various shortcomings in the procedures and not the executive nature of the review as such that the States in question were found to be in violation of Article 3. Moreover, in the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case the Court made some suggestions regarding the measures to be taken to execute the judgment but without suggesting that a judicial mechanism was required (at \u00a7 71 of that judgment; see in the same sense \u00d6calan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03, 197/04, 6201/06 and 10464/07, \u00a7 207, 18 March 2014).\n49. That an executive review can satisfy the requirements of Article 3 is shown by the Court\u2019s assessment of the systems in Cyprus and Bulgaria. Regarding the former, the power of the President of Cyprus, in light of the practice followed, was found to be sufficient (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 102\u2011103). Regarding the latter, the power vested in the President of Bulgaria was likewise found to be in compliance with Article 3, following reform in 2012 (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 257\u2011261). The Court notes here that the relevant European standard does not exclude executive review but refers to decisions on conditional release being taken by the \u201cauthorities established by law\u201d (paragraph 32 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22, see paragraph 20 above).\n50. It is therefore clear from the case-law that the executive nature of a review is not in itself contrary to the requirements of Article 3. The Court sees no reason to depart from this.\n51. As for the applicant\u2019s criticisms of the domestic system, the Court considers that these are countered by the effect of the Human Rights Act. As recalled in McLoughlin (see paragraph 29 of that decision, set out at paragraph 19 above), the Secretary of State is bound by section 6 of that Act to exercise the power of release in a manner compatible with Convention rights. He or she is required to have regard to the relevant case-law of this Court and to provide reasons for each decision. The power or, depending on the circumstances, the duty of the Secretary of State to release a prisoner on compassionate grounds cannot therefore be regarded as akin to the broad discretion conferred on the Head of State in certain other jurisdictions and found to be insufficient for the purposes of Article 3 in the cases referred to above.\n52. Furthermore, the Secretary of State\u2019s decisions on possible release are subject to review by the domestic courts, themselves bound by the same duty to act compatibly with Convention rights. The Court notes here the Government\u2019s statement that judicial review of a refusal by the Secretary of State to release a prisoner would not be confined to formal or procedural grounds, but would also involve an examination of the merits. Thus the High Court would have the power to directly order the release of the prisoner, if it considered this to be necessary in order to comply with Article 3 (see paragraph 26 above).\n53. Although the Court has not been provided with any examples of judicial review of a refusal by the Secretary of State to release a life prisoner, it is nonetheless satisfied that a significant judicial safeguard is now in place (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 181\u2011A). The absence of any practice to date, which is unsurprising given the relatively brief period since the McLoughlin decision, does not necessarily count against the domestic system, just as it did not count against the Slovak and French systems, both found to be in conformity with Article 3 without reference to any judicial practice (see in particular \u00a7 60 of Bodein).\nii. Scope of review\n54. In the McLoughlin decision, the Court of Appeal took the view, as did this Court in Vinter, that the policy set down in the Lifer Manual was a highly restrictive one. It reiterated the position stated in Bieber that the Secretary of State must exercise his power of release in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3 of the Convention (see, respectively, paragraphs 32 and 29 of McLoughlin, set out at paragraph 19 above).\n55. In addition, and crucially, it specified, having regard to the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter, that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d referred to in section 30 cannot legally be limited to end-of-life situations as announced in the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), but must include all exceptional circumstances that are relevant to release on compassionate grounds. Although the Court of Appeal refrained from specifying further the meaning of the words \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in this context, or to elaborate criteria, it recalled earlier domestic case-law to the effect that exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in prison is to be taken into account (per Lord Bingham CJ in the 1998 judgment R v Home Secretary ex parte Hindley, and also Lord Steyn when that same case was decided by the House of Lords in 2001 \u2013 see paragraph 19 above). The Court further notes that in Bieber, when explaining the time at which an Article 3 challenge could be brought by a whole life prisoner, the Court of Appeal referred to \u201call the material circumstances, including the time that he has served and the progress made in prison\u201d (reproduced in Vinter and Others, cited above, at \u00a7 49). Having regard to all of these dicta, it is evidently part of the established law of England and Wales that exceptional progress towards rehabilitation comes within the meaning of the statutory language and is thus a ground for review.\n56. As for the other term used in section 30, \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d, here too the narrow emphasis put upon it in the Lifer Manual has been corrected by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed that the term is not limited to humanitarian grounds but has a wide meaning, so as to be compatible with Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 33 of McLoughlin, set out at paragraph 19 above). In this respect too, the role of the Human Rights Act is of importance, section 3 of the Act requiring that legislation be interpreted and applied by all public bodies in a Convention\u2011compliant way.\n57. These clarifications are sufficient to satisfy the Court as to the existence of a review that not only can but also must consider whether, in light of significant change in a whole life prisoner and progress towards rehabilitation, continued detention can still be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 125).\niii. Criteria and conditions for review\n58. The Court must next examine the criteria and conditions for review of whole life sentences. McLoughlin did not elaborate further on the meaning of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, the Court of Appeal deeming it sufficiently certain in itself. The applicant was critical of this, arguing that it left him in a state of uncertainty. The Government considered that matters were sufficiently clear, no greater degree of specificity being possible or feasible. As the Court has already noted above, the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d encompasses the progress by the prisoner during the service of sentence (see paragraph 55 above). The relevant question is whether those serving life sentences in the domestic system can know what they must do to be considered for release, and under what conditions the review takes place (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122; see also paragraph 18 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22 and Rule 30.3 of the European Prison Rules, at paragraphs 20 and 21 above).\n59. Both parties referred to cases decided by Chambers of this Court after the Vinter ruling. These judgments are indeed relevant here, in that they illustrate the application by the Court of the Vinter case-law. In the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case, it was the lack of specific guidance as to the criteria and conditions for gathering the prisoner\u2019s \u201cpersonal particulars\u201d and for assessing them that was criticised. As there was no duty on the executive to give reasons for a decision, it meant that prisoners did not know what was required of them in order to be considered for release (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58). Under Article 46, the Chamber called for a reform that would ensure the relevant review, and that life prisoners would know \u201cwith some degree of precision\u201d what they must do (at \u00a7 71). In the Harakchiev and Tolumov case, the Court faulted the system as it was pre-2012 for its opacity, for the lack of publicly-available policy statements, for the absence of reasons on individual requests for clemency, and also for the complete lack of formal and informal safeguards (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 262). In another case, Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, ECHR 2014 (extracts), the Chamber based its finding of a violation of Article 3 on the absence of a sentence review mechanism operating on the basis of \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria of which the prisoner had precise cognisance at the time of imposition of the life sentence\u201d (\u00a7 137). The applicant relied on this statement in particular. The Court observes that while there is some variation in the formulations employed in these judgments, the essential point is the same in each of them, namely that there needs to be a degree of specificity or precision as to the criteria and conditions attaching to sentence review, in keeping with the general requirement of legal certainty.\n60. Consideration must equally be given to the post-Vinter cases in which the Court concluded that the domestic system was in conformity with the requirements of Article 3 as regards the reducibility of life sentences. There are three such judgments, and they demonstrate that a high degree of precision is not required in order to satisfy the Convention.\n61. The first is the Harakchiev and Tolumov case, in which the Court considered that as from 2012 there was adequate clarity surrounding the presidential power of clemency. Although, by its nature, the procedure was not subject to statutory criteria, the Constitutional Court derived guiding principles from constitutional values, namely \u201cequity, humanity, compassion, mercy, and the health and family situation of the convicted offender, and any positive changes in his or her personality\u201d (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, see \u00a7 258). It is only the last of these that concerns progress by the prisoner. Although the procedure did not provide for the giving of reasons in individual cases, transparency was nonetheless ensured by other means. The Clemency Commission, created to advise on requests for clemency, functioned in accordance with published Rules of Procedure. These required it to take account of the relevant case-law of international courts on the interpretation and application of the relevant international human rights instruments. The rules also required the Clemency Commission to publish activity reports, which it did monthly and yearly, detailing its examination of requests for clemency, its advice to the Vice-President and the latter\u2019s decision on such requests (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-107). The Court found that these measures increased the transparency of the clemency procedure and constituted an additional guarantee of the consistent and transparent exercise of the presidential power (ibid., \u00a7 259).\n62. In the \u010ca\u010dko case, the Court noted that the criteria for early release were that the prisoner \u201chas demonstrated improvement by fulfilling his or her obligations and by good behaviour\u201d and that \u201cit can be expected that the person concerned will behave in an appropriate manner in the future\u201d (\u010ca\u010dko, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the Bodein case, the Chamber noted that the review in French law was based on the dangerousness of the prisoner as well as any changes in his personality during the service of sentence (Bodein, cited above, \u00a7 60).\n63. The Court does not regard the domestic system as deficient in this particular respect for two closely-related reasons. First, the exercise of the section 30 power will, as is clear from McLoughlin and by virtue of the Human Rights Act, be guided by all of the relevant case-law of this Court as it stands at present and as it may be further developed or clarified in future. By setting out its relevant case-law in the preceding paragraphs, the Court\u2019s purpose is to aid the Secretary of State and the domestic courts to fulfil their statutory duty to act compatibly with the Convention in this area.\n64. The second reason is that, as the Court of Appeal stated and the Chamber accepted, it can be expected that the concrete meaning of the terms used in section 30 will continue to be further fleshed out in practice. The duty on the Secretary of State to give the reasons for each such decision, subject to judicial review, is of significance here, being a guarantee of the consistent and transparent exercise of the power of release.\n65. The Court sees fit to add, however, that a revision of the Lifer Manual (and other official sources of information) so as to reflect the law as it has been clarified by the Court of Appeal, and to reflect also the relevant Article 3 case-law, would be desirable so that the applicable law is readily accessible. The Court refers once again to the relevant standard defined by the Council of Europe (see paragraph 18 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22, at paragraph 20 above).\niv. Timeframe for review\n66. One particular aspect of legal certainty is the timeframe for sentence review, the Court having stated in Vinter that a prisoner should not be obliged to wait and serve an indeterminate number of years before being permitted to mount an Article 3 challenge (see paragraph 44 above).\n67. In general, providing for an automatic review of sentence after a specified minimum term represents an important safeguard for the prisoner against the risk of detention in violation of Article 3. The Court refers in this respect to the \u00d6calan (no. 2) case. It found there that domestic law clearly prohibited the applicant from applying at any point in his sentence of aggravated life imprisonment for release on legitimate penological grounds. The Turkish authorities were therefore required to establish a procedure to review whether the applicant\u2019s incarceration remained justified after a minimum term of detention (\u00d6calan (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 204 and \u00a7 207). The domestic system in this case differs in that the process of review can be initiated by the prisoner at any time. The Court recalls that it took note of a similar arrangement in Cyprus, where life prisoners could benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103). It is possible to regard this as being in the interest of prisoners, since they are not required to wait for a set number of years for a first or subsequent review. In light of the very serious nature of the crimes committed by persons in this category though, it has to be expected that their period of detention will be lengthy.\n68. In two of the post-Vinter cases decided by this Court, the domestic system included a review of sentence after a set period \u2013 25 years in \u010ca\u010dko and 30 years in Bodein (effectively 26 years in that applicant\u2019s case). In the Harakchiev and Tolumov case though, the domestic system subsequent to the 2012 reforms did not include a fixed timeframe for review of sentence. Furthermore, the Court found a violation of Article 3 in the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case and gave indications under Article 46 as to the necessary measures without referring to the question of the timing of the review in either context.\n69. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court does not consider that the concern expressed in Vinter regarding indeterminacy, and the repercussions of this for a whole life prisoner (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122) can be said to arise for the applicant at present. As is stated in section 30 of the 1997 Act, the Secretary of State may order release \u201cat any time\u201d. It follows, as the Government have confirmed, that it is open to the applicant to trigger, at any time, a review of his detention by the Secretary of State. It is not for the Court to speculate as to how efficiently such a system, which has minimum regulation, might generally operate in practice. It is the individual situation of the applicant that is the focus of these proceedings, and he has not suggested that he is prevented or deterred from applying to the Secretary of State at any time to be considered for release. Before concluding, though, the Court refers once again as it did in the Vinter case to the relevant comparative and international materials that show \u201cclear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter\u201d (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 120; see more recently and in the same sense Murray, cited above, \u00a7 99).\nv. Conclusion\n70. The Court considers that the McLoughlin decision has dispelled the lack of clarity identified in Vinter arising out of the discrepancy within the domestic system between the applicable law and the published official policy. In addition, the Court of Appeal has brought clarification as regards the scope and grounds of the review by the Secretary of State, the manner in which it should be conducted, as well as the duty of the Secretary of State to release a whole life prisoner where continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. In this way, the domestic system, based on statute (the 1997 Act and the Human Rights Act), case\u2011law (of the domestic courts and this Court) and published official policy (the Lifer Manual) no longer displays the contrast that the Court identified in Vinter (cited above, \u00a7 130). Further specification of the circumstances in which a whole life prisoner may seek release, with reference to the legitimate penological grounds for detention, may come through domestic practice. The statutory obligation on national courts to take into account the Article 3 case-law as it may develop in future provides an additional important safeguard.\n71. As the Court has often stated, the primary responsibility for protecting the rights set out in the Convention lies with the domestic authorities (see for example O.H. v. Germany, no. 4646/08, \u00a7 118, 24 November 2011). It considers that the Court of Appeal drew the necessary conclusions from the Vinter judgment and, by clarifying domestic law, addressed the cause of the Convention violation (see also Kronfeldner v. Germany, no. 21906/09, \u00a7 59, 19 January 2012).\n72. The Court concludes that the whole life sentence can now be regarded as reducible, in keeping with Article 3 of the Convention.\n73. As indicated at the outset (see paragraph 37 above), given that the parties\u2019 submissions were confined to the current state of the domestic law, the Court has not found it necessary to examine separately whether the requirements of Article 3 in relation to whole life sentences, as laid down in the Vinter judgment, were complied with in the applicant\u2019s case prior to the McLoughlin decision. It would nevertheless observe, as the Government themselves in effect recognised before the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment in McLoughlin, that at that time the material circumstances regarding the applicant\u2019s whole life sentence were indistinguishable from those of the applicants in the Vinter case (see paragraph 23 above).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\nHolds, by fourteen votes to three, that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 17 January 2017.\nJohan Callewaert Andr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3\nDeputy to the Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) Dissenting opinion of Judge L\u00f3pez Guerra;\n(b) Dissenting opinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque;\n(c) Separate opinion of Judge Saj\u00f3.\n#### A.S.\n#### J.C.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE L\u00d3PEZ GUERRA\nMy dissent derives from the final statement in the Grand Chamber judgment (see paragraph 73), that is, its refusal to examine the applicant\u2019s situation as it stood prior to the domestic R. v. McLoughlin decision. As I see it, that situation (which began, in contrast to the Grand Chamber\u2019s assessment, with the applicant\u2019s sentencing in 1984, thus encompassing a span of thirty years) represents a violation of Article 3 of the Convention, as the applicant was denied any hope of one day (however far in the future) being released from prison. On the contrary, the certainty that he would remain imprisoned for the rest of his life was borne down upon him.\nThe applicant was sentenced in 1984 to a term of life imprisonment. As shown in the facts in the Grand Chamber judgment, his was defined as a \u201clife case\u201d by the trial judge in 1988, and the Lord Chief Justice recommended that the applicant should never be released. In 1994 the Secretary of State informed the applicant that he had decided to impose a whole life term. In 2008 the High Court found there was no reason to depart from the Secretary of State\u2019s decision. That finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal. It was in that same year that the application was submitted to this Court. Five years later, in 2013, while the present application was still pending, the Court issued its ruling in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts)), which addressed the compatibility of the conditions of life imprisonment in the United Kingdom with Article 3 of the Convention. In that judgment, the Court, interpreting Article 3, established that the Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence; nonetheless, in order to be compatible with Article 3 such a sentence must be reducible de jure et de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 42). Such an interpretation was reiterated very recently in Murray v. the Netherlands ([GC], no. 10511/10, ECHR 2016). Such is therefore the consolidated (for the time being) interpretation by this Court of Article 3 of the Convention, an interpretation which is not disputed by the applicant. This interpretation is not, therefore, the object of the case, nor of the applicant\u2019s claim.\nThe basis for the present application, introduced, as noted above, in 2008, was that the whole life order was in breach of Article 3. Before the Grand Chamber, the applicant maintains that even since the McLoughlin judgment, the United Kingdom\u2019s legal order with regard to life imprisonment continues to be contrary to that article, and does not meet the requisites established by this Court in Vinter.\nThe present Grand Chamber judgment considers that the current situation in this respect derives from the lines established in the case-law of the United Kingdom courts, notably by the Court of Appeal in the McLoughlin case. It accepts that the principles established in that judgment in 2014 have dispelled the deficiencies identified in Vinter with regard to the United Kingdom\u2019s legal system in respect of life imprisonment and its compatibility with Article 3, namely concerning the possibility of a review of the terms of a life sentence, the scope of such a review, the criteria and conditions to be applied and the timeframe for the review. Therefore, it concludes that, at the present time and as a consequence of McLoughlin, the whole life sentence imposed on the applicant can now be regarded as reducible, in keeping with Article 3 of the Convention. There is now, according to the Grand Chamber, no violation of that article. Notwithstanding the applicant\u2019s submissions, I see no reason to differ from the detailed reasoning of the Grand Chamber on this point.\nBut of course, this conclusion (and the use of the term \u201cnow\u201d in paragraph 72 of the judgment is revealing) refers to the situation existing at the present moment, and more precisely to the situation existing now (in 2016) as a consequence of the McLoughlin judgment in 2014.\nEven admitting that, in the opinion of the Grand Chamber, there is not at present a violation of Article 3 with respect to the applicant as a result of the above ruling, an issue remains concerning his situation between the point that he was sentenced to a whole life term and the date on which the McLoughlin judgment was delivered, thus translating into the United Kingdom\u2019s legal system the principles set out by this Court in Vinter.\nIn the latter judgment, the Court found that the situation in the United Kingdom concerning life imprisonment was in contradiction with the standards of Article 3. As it transpires from the Grand Chamber\u2019s considerations in the present case, such a situation persisted until 2014, the date of the McLoughlin judgment. Therefore, the applicant was subject from his sentencing to a whole life term until that date (that is, for thirty years) to a situation which in itself represented a violation of Article 3.\nI find it somewhat puzzling that the Grand Chamber considers that the applicant\u2019s claim was confined \u201cto the present state of the domestic law\u201d (see paragraph 73), given that he submitted his application in 2008 and then only after having unsuccessfully attempted for many years to obtain a remedy, on many occasions, before the United Kingdom authorities. During this time, the applicant, sentenced to a whole life term, was deprived of any prospect of review, or of mitigation of that penalty. He was therefore subjected to what was defined by the Court in Vinter as inhuman treatment, and I consider that the Grand Chamber in its present judgment should have recognised that fact and found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE PINTO DE ALBUQUERQUE\nTable of Contents\n### I.

Conclusion (\u00a7\u00a7 48-50)\n### I. Introduction (\u00a7 1)\n1. I beg to disagree with this judgment. I find that the McLoughlin decision should not be regarded as complying with the requirements of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) as exposed in the Vinter and Others judgment. The majority\u2019s ingenious effort to reconcile the letter and spirit of Vinter and Others with McLoughlin raises not only questions of linguistic precision, logical coherence and legal certainty that were left unanswered in the present judgment, but also the fundamental issue of the compatibility of section 2 of the Human Rights Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), as applied in the present case by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d), with the Convention. The purpose of this dissent is to reply to these questions.\nFirst Part (\u00a7\u00a7 2-25)\n### II. The Convention law on parole (\u00a7\u00a7 2-10)\n#### A. The acknowledgment of the right to parole in Vinter (\u00a7\u00a7 2-6)\n2. On 9 July 2013 the European Court of Human Rights (\u201cthe Court\u201d) held, in Vinter and Others, that whole life orders violate Article 3 of Convention. The Court\u2019s critique concerned two interconnected issues: the lack of clarity as to the law at the relevant time concerning the prospect of release for life prisoners given the discrepancy between various sources, as well as the absence of any dedicated parole mechanism for whole life orders. In view of both of these deficiencies in the domestic law, the Court found that the applicants\u2019 life sentences could not be regarded as reducible for the purposes of Article 3 of the Convention.\n3. For the Court, the discrepancy between domestic case-law as stated in Bieber and the official policy set out in the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (the \u201cLifer Manual\u201d)0 made it unclear \u201cat the present time\u201d whether \u201cthe Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber\u201d0. The Court did not find the possibility of judicial review of any ministerial refusal to release a life prisoner, in the course of which the legal framework would come to be clarified, sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity existing at the relevant (\u201cpresent\u201d) time as to the state of applicable domestic law.\n4. The Court further added that, for a whole life order to be compatible with Article 3, a parole mechanism has to be in place at the time that a sentence is imposed. States must establish a mechanism to review the justification of continued imprisonment on the basis of the penological needs of the prisoner sentenced to a whole life order. The parole review must take place within a pre-determined, reasonable timeframe, but this does not prevent it being sought at the prisoner\u2019s initiative at any point after sentencing.\n5. The criteria and conditions, including timing, for assessing the appropriateness of parole must be established by law in a clear and foreseeable manner and be based primarily on rehabilitation (i.e. special prevention) considerations and secondarily on deterrence (i.e. general preventive) considerations. The criteria should not be limited to the prisoner\u2019s mental or physical infirmity or closeness to death. Such \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d are clearly too restrictive. According to the Court, that was the case with section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the Lifer Manual.\n6. The logical conclusion from the above is that, if a parole mechanism must be available to those convicted of the most heinous crimes, a fortiori it must be available to other prisoners. It would fly in the face of justice if offenders convicted of less serious offences could not be paroled whenever they are apt to reintegrate society, while such an opportunity would be afforded to offenders convicted of more serious crimes. In other words, the Convention guarantees a right to parole, if and when the legal requisites of parole obtain. Furthermore, parole is not a release from the sentence, but a modification of the form of State interference with the sentenced person\u2019s liberty, by way of supervision of his or her life at large, and this supervision may take a very stringent form, with strict conditions attached, according to the needs of each paroled person.\n#### B. The statement of the \u201crelevant principles\u201d on parole in Murray (\u00a7\u00a7 7-10)\n7. In Murray, the Court was even more explicit. According to paragraphs 99 and 100 of that judgment, the parole mechanism must comply with the following five binding, \u201crelevant principles\u201d:\n(1) the principle of legality (\u201crules having a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty\u201d, \u201cconditions laid down in domestic legislation\u201d);\n(2) the principle of the assessment of penological grounds for continued incarceration, on the basis of \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria\u201d, which include resocialisation (special prevention), deterrence (general prevention) and retribution;\n(3) the principle of assessment within a pre-established time frame and, in the case of life prisoners, \u201cnot later than 25 years after the imposition of the sentence and thereafter a periodic review\u201d;\n(4) the principle of fair procedural guarantees, which include at least the obligation to give reasons for decisions not to release or to recall a prisoner;\n(5) the principle of judicial review.\n8. In Murray, the Court reaffirmed that, as a matter of principle, the criteria on which to assess the appropriateness of parole must be established by law in a clear and foreseeable manner. Beyond Vinter and Others, the authorities confirmed by the Grand Chamber were Trabelsi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar and Harakchiev and Tolumov. This position is also provided for by paragraph 10 of the Committee of Ministers Resolution (76) 2, paragraphs 3, 4 and 20 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2003)22, and paragraph 34 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2003)23, and, on the world stage, by Article 110 of the 1998 Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute) and Rule 223 (Criteria for review concerning reduction of sentence) of its Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Thus, according to the Grand Chamber, the parole assessment criteria are not left to the discretion of the member States. The parole review mechanism must be based on \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria\u201d, namely those \u201clegitimate penological grounds\u201d explicitly established in paragraph 100 of the Murray judgment. Most importantly of all, the Court restated that penological grounds do not equate to, and should not be confused with, \u201ccompassionate grounds for reasons of health related to ill-health, physical integrity and old age\u201d0.\n9. According to Murray, the parole review must take place within a pre\u2011determined, reasonable timeframe. The authority invoked by the Court was Bodein v. France. This position is in line with paragraph 9 of the Committee of Ministers Resolution (76) 2 and paragraph 5 of the Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2003)22 and also, at the global level, with Article 110 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Rome Statute. In the event that parole is not determined at the time of the initial review, the prisoner\u2019s situation should be reviewed at reasonable, not too widely spaced intervals, as also indicated by paragraph 12 of Committee of Ministers Resolution (76) 2, and paragraph 21 of Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2003)22.\n10. Finally, still in the light of the Murray \u201crelevant principles\u201d, the parole decision must be taken in a fair and adversarial procedure, reasoned and amenable to judicial review. This is also provided by paragraph 32 of Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2003)22, Article 110 \u00a7 2 of the Rome Statute and Rule 224 of its Rules of Procedure and Evidence.\nTo sum up, having established the above-mentioned \u201crelevant principles\u201d, it could be expected that the Court had reached in Murray a point of no return in its standard-setting function for the protection of human rights of prisoners in Europe. Unfortunately this expectation proved to be wrong in the present case.\n### III. The UK legal framework on parole for whole life sentence (\u00a7\u00a7 11\u201126)\n#### A. The reaction of the Court of Appeal to Vinter (\u00a7\u00a7 11-18)\n11. In McLoughlin, the Court of Appeal was specifically constituted to consider the issue of compatibility of a whole life order with the Convention. It found that the Vinter and Others judgment did not prevent imposition of whole life orders for \u201cheinous crimes\u201d, since the law of England and Wales did provide for reducibility as the conditions set out in the Lifer Manual, although \u201cexceptional\u201d, were not too restrictive and indeed had a \u201cwide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case-by-case basis\u201d. In other words, the Court of Appeal held that the Grand Chamber was wrong in its interpretation of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the Lifer Manual.\n12. The Court of Appeal addressed the critique of Vinter and Others in the following terms: \u201cAs we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence.\u201d0 Hence, it is implicit in the Court of Appeal\u2019s formulaic reasoning that it would be unlawful for the Secretary of State to follow his own published policy, which the Court of Appeal also regarded as \u201chighly restrictive\u201d0. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s understanding, if an offender subject to a whole life order can establish that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d have arisen subsequent to the imposition of the sentence, the Secretary of State must consider all the relevant circumstances, in a manner compatible with Article 3. Any decision by the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to judicial review, which would serve to elucidate the meaning of the terms \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d, as is the usual process under the common law.\n13. The fact that the national court specifically addressed the first critique expressed by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others as to the clarity and certainty of the state of domestic law is not the end of the matter. The domestic court\u2019s interpretation of domestic law raises rather serious linguistic, logical and legal questions, as the applicant argued. In terms of linguistic precision, the thorny question to be put is the following: what does \u201ccompassion\u201d have to do with \u201cjustifiable penological grounds\u201d0 for continued imprisonment? It is plain that the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation of the letter of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances of Prison Service Order 4700 chapter 12 simply does not square with the meaning of the concept of \u201ccompassion\u201d in Western culture. Is the \u201cwide meaning\u201d of compassionate grounds so wide that it has no connection with the dictionary meaning of the word \u201ccompassion\u201d? In this respect, Lord Atkin\u2019s judgment in Liversidge v Anderson should not be forgotten:\n\u201cI view with apprehension the attitude of judges who on a mere question of construction, when face to face with claims involving the liberty of the subject, show themselves more executive-minded than the executive. Their function is to give words their natural meaning, not perhaps in war time leaning towards liberty, but following the dictum of Pollock C.B. in Bowditch v. Balchin (1850, 5 Ex. 378), cited with approval by my noble and learned friend Lord Wright in Barnard v. Gorman (1941, 3 All E.R., at p. 55), \u2018in a case in which the liberty of the subject is concerned, we \u201ccannot go beyond the natural construction of the Statute.\u2019\u201d0\n14. In terms of logical coherence, the unavoidable question is the following: How can it be logically sustained that a \u201chighly restrictive\u201d0 provision like Prison Service Order 4700 chapter 12 can be interpreted with a \u201cwide meaning\u201d? How can a \u201chighly restrictive\u201d rule on \u201cexceptional conditions\u201d0 capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State\u2019s power under section 30 be interpreted extensively? The golden rule of interpretation is that restrictive rules, with exhaustive terms, must be interpreted narrowly. And this for a basic reason, one that already appeared in the Humpty-Dumpty story: \u201cWhen I use a word, it means just what I intended it to mean, and neither more nor less\u201d. \u201cBut\u201d, said Alice, \u201cthe question is whether you can make a word mean different things.\u201d \u201cNot so\u201d, said Humpty-Dumpty, \u201cthe question is which is to be the master. That\u2019s all.\u201d Figuratively, the master, that is, the Secretary of State, may know what \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d are when he sees them, but prisoners, lawyers and even judges will find it difficult to anticipate his or her judgment.\n15. The linguistic and logical fragility of the Court of Appeal\u2019s line of argument necessarily impacts on its legal force. In purely legal terms, the crucial question is this: What can be more unclear, uncertain and therefore unpredictable than a discretionary power to release in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d which is converted into an obligation to release with a \u201cwide meaning\u201d in accordance with the principles set out in the Court\u2019s case-law on Article 3 of the Convention? What can be more unclear, uncertain and therefor unpredictable than \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d with a \u201cwide meaning\u201d? How can judges and lawyers, even experienced ones, apply such an unpredictable system and how can prisoners rely on it? No answer to these questions is to be found in the majority\u2019s judgment in the present case.\n16. On the face of it, it is evident that the review mechanism provided for by section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the Lifer Manual, even when read in the light of the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation, does not provide for \u201ca review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds\u201d0. As already indicated, the violation in Vinter rests on two grounds, the first one being the lack of certainty and the second one being the absence of a dedicated review mechanism. They remain untouched.\n17. First, the lack of clarity and certainty of the legal framework was not dispelled by McLoughlin. The Court of Appeal did not clearly state what are the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that are capable of triggering the review mechanism, or what are the grounds on which this review can be sought. On the contrary, it stated that \u201cthe term \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 is of itself sufficiently certain\u201d0. In spite of the fact that the relevant provision of the Lifer Manual is still headed \u201cCompassionate release on medical grounds\u201d, which plainly shows what section 30 was intended for, the Court of Appeal contended that the \u201cwide meaning\u201d of \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d encompasses \u201clegitimate penological reasons\u201d. The contention is not new. It had already been made by the Government and explicitly rejected by the Grand Chamber in paragraph 129 of the Vinter judgment. This way, the dialogue between courts risks becoming two parallel monologues until one of them gives up.\n18. Second, the Court of Appeal did not provide the slightest hint on the features of the dedicated parole process by which a prisoner may be or may not be eligible to apply for review of his or her whole life order, including the time when he or she can expect to be able to make such an application for review, who should conduct the review and the periodic availability of further reviews after the first one.\n#### B. The duty to take into account the Convention (\u00a7\u00a7 19-25)\n19. The Court of Appeal argued that by virtue of sections 3 and 6 of the Human Rights Act, section 30 of the 1997 Act had to be interpreted and applied broadly enough so as to comply with Article 3 of the Convention in every case. The Lifer Manual did not and could not restrict or in any way fetter this obligation. Here lies the crux of the case. This argument raises a more general, and fundamental issue: that of the compatibility of section 2 of the Human Rights Act, as applied in the present case by the Court of Appeal, with the Convention obligations of the United Kingdom.\n20. The Act lays a general duty on all public authorities to respect Convention rights (section 6), adding to their general duty to act in accordance with administrative law principles. They are domestic rights and their formal source is the Act. Being \u201cpublic authorities\u201d, the duty applies to the domestic courts as much as to the Secretary of State. To fail to observe Convention rights and freedoms is to act unlawfully, giving rise to appropriate judicial relief (sections 6 and 8). The Act places the domestic courts under a duty to \u201ctake into account\u201d the case-law of this Court (section 2). Section 3 of the Act is a crucial provision, laying down the obligation to read and give effect to legislation, primary and secondary, in a way that is compatible with Convention rights, so far as it is possible to do so. Section 3 does not affect the validity of any incompatible primary legislation or of any secondary legislation if in the latter case primary legislation prevents the removal of incompatibility (save for the possibility of revocation). The purpose behind the Act is to delegate to the courts the bulk of the work of ensuring Convention-compliant application of domestic law. In short, declarations of incompatibility should be the last resort.\n21. Hence, the Convention was given legal effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act and a constitutional status in the legislation establishing the devolution of legislative power in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. It did not supersede the human-rights protection afforded by common law or statute, or create a discrete body of law based upon the judgments of the European court. In spite of the critique that the Act would represent \u201cA field day for crackpots, a pain in the neck for judges and a gold mine for lawyers\u201d0, domestic courts have sought, in their interpretation and application of the Convention, to take greater responsibility for the implementation of the Convention rights and freedoms. They did this in the belief that it could not have been Parliament\u2019s intention that Convention rights and freedoms enshrined in the Human Rights Act were to remain set in stone as they were when the Act was passed.\n22. In Ullah, Lord Bingham enunciated the \u201cmirror principle\u201d, stating that national courts must \u201ckeep pace with the Strasbourg jurisprudence as it evolves over time: no more, but certainly no less\u201d0. In McCaughey, Lady Hale shared the same insight, stating that\n\u201cIf the evolutive interpretation of the Convention rights means that they now mean something different from what they meant when the 1998 Act was passed, then it is our duty to give effect to their current meaning, rather than to the one they had before\u201d0.\nFurthermore, where no specific case-law exists regarding the respondent State, the domestic courts are supposed, under the Human Rights Act, to take into consideration the Court\u2019s decisions concerning similar legal problems and \u201cseek to extract specific principles from those decisions, and then apply them to the facts of the cases before us\u201d0, or in other words, to respect the res interpretata effect of the Court\u2019s decisions for all Contracting parties.\n23. It should be noted that the domestic courts have been prepared to go to great lengths, and to adopt more expansive interpretations of legislative language in order to comply with the statutory command to achieve compatibility with the Convention. In the leading House of Lords case Ghaidan v. Godin-Mendoza0, the House held, reversing earlier case-law, that the phrase \u201ca person who was living with the original tenant as his or her wife or husband shall be treated as the spouse of the original tenant\u201d must be read as including same-sex partners. Lord Nicholls wrote:\n\u201cThe mere fact the language under consideration is inconsistent with a Convention\u2011compliant meaning does not of itself make a Convention-compliant interpretation under section 3 impossible. Section 3 enables language to be interpreted restrictively or expansively. But section 3 goes further than this. It is also apt to require a court to read in words which change the meaning of the enacted legislation, so as to make it Convention-compliant. In other words, the intention of Parliament in enacting section 3 was that, to an extent bounded only by what is \u2018possible\u2019, a court can modify the meaning, and hence the effect, of primary and secondary legislation.\u201d 0\nHence, the role of the courts in United Kingdom is not, as in traditional statutory interpretation, to find the true meaning of the provision, but to find, if possible, the meaning which best accords with Convention rights and freedoms. Accordingly, even when the words of an Act of Parliament are, approaching them literally, clear and unambiguous, they can still be departed from, added to or ignored under Section 3 of the Human Rights Act if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve compatibility with a Convention right.\n24. Yet some cases have arisen were the domestic courts have preferred to say that the beams were in the eyes of others. Pointing the finger to some unclear and inconstant case-law on the part of the Court, Lord Slynn set the tone for the future as far back as in R (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions:\n\u201cIn the absence of some special circumstances it seems to me that the court should follow any clear and constant jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.\u201d0\nIn R v Horncastle, Lord Philips went a step further:\n\u201cThere will, however, be rare occasions where the domestic court has concerns as to whether a decision of the Strasbourg court sufficiently appreciates or accommodates particular aspects of our domestic process. In such circumstances, it is open to the domestic court to decline to follow the Strasbourg decision, giving reasons for adopting this course\u201d.0\nThe following year, Lord Neuberger summarised in Manchester City Council v Pinnock this apparently settled view in the following terms:\n\u201cThis court is not bound to follow every decision of the European court. Not only would it be impractical to do so: it would sometimes be inappropriate, as it would destroy the ability of the court to engage in the constructive dialogue with the European court which is of value to the development of Convention law: see eg R v Horncastle [2010] 2 AC 373. Of course, we should usually follow a clear and constant line of decisions by the European court: R (Ullah) v Special Adjudicator [2004] 2 AC 323. But we are not actually bound to do so or (in theory, at least) to follow a decision of the Grand Chamber. As Lord Mance pointed out in Doherty v Birmingham City Council [2009] AC 367, para 126, section 2 of the 1998 Act requires our courts to \u2018take into account\u2019 European court decisions, not necessarily to follow them. Where, however, there is a clear and constant line of decisions whose effect is not inconsistent with some fundamental substantive or procedural aspect of our law, and whose reasoning does not appear to overlook or misunderstand some argument or point of principle, we consider that it would be wrong for this court not to follow that line.\u201d0\n25. There are limits to this process, as Lord Mance (with whom Lord Hope, Lord Hughes and Lord Kerr concurred) clearly admitted in Chester, \u201cparticularly where the matter has been already to a Grand Chamber once or, even more so, as in this case, twice\u201d, referring to the two Grand Chamber judgements of Hirst and Scoppola (no. 3)0. His Lordship added:\n\u201cIt would have then to involve some truly fundamental principle of our law or some most egregious oversight or misunderstanding before it could be appropriate for the Court to contemplate an outright refusal to follow Strasbourg authority at the Grand Chamber level.\u201d\nLord Sumption made much the same point when he wrote:\n\u201cIn the ordinary use of language, to \u201ctake into account\u201d a decision of the European Court of Human Rights means no more than to consider it, which is consistent with rejecting it as wrong. However, this is not an approach that a United Kingdom court can adopt, save in altogether exceptional cases... A decision of the European Court of Human Rights is more than an opinion about the meaning of the Convention. It is an adjudication by the tribunal which the United Kingdom has by treaty agreed should give definitive rulings on the subject. The courts are therefore bound to treat them as authoritative expositions of the Convention which the Convention intends them to be, unless it is apparent that it misunderstood or overlooked some significant feature of English law or practice which may, when properly explained, lead to the decision being revised by the Strasbourg Court.\u201d0\nIn other words, the domestic authorities\u2019 ultimate test for acceptance of the Court\u2019s judgments guidance seems to be determined by an apparently strict logic of norm/exception, according to which only in \u201crare cases\u201d or \u201cexceptional cases\u201d when particularly important aspects of the domestic legal order are ignored or misunderstood the authorities will venture to say that the Court\u2019s judgments should not be followed. This was precisely the understanding underlying the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.\nSecond Part (\u00a7\u00a7 26-47)\n### IV. The State obligation in the present case (\u00a7\u00a7 26-34)\n#### A. The position of the respondent Government (\u00a7\u00a7 26-29)\n26. The Government argue that the applicant\u2019s point about the dictionary meaning of the word \u201ccompassion\u201d is beside the point. In its statutory context the term \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d should now be understood in light of the requirements of Article 3 in this regard. Even assuming, for the sake of the discussion, that this should be the case under the Human Rights Act, the question still remains that the Court of Appeal declined to give more precise or concrete meaning to the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, finding it to be sufficiently certain of itself. Where Vinter and Others invoked the principle of legal certainty, the Court of Appeal found it \u201centirely consistent with the rule of law\u201d to consider requests on an individual basis against the criterion of an exceptional change in circumstances. It should be recalled that in Bieber, which remains good law, the Court of Appeal referred to \u201call the material circumstances, including the time ... served and the progress made in prison\u201d. No more specific indication appears to exist in domestic case-law regarding the criteria to be taken into account in reviewing a whole life sentence. Instead of specificity, as required by the principle of legality, there is breadth.\n27. The Court\u2019s standard on the definition of the relevant parole grounds is much more demanding. In Harakchiev and Tolumov, the Court emphasized the importance of official policy statements and the general criteria guiding the authorities in the exercise of the power of clemency. It emphasized the importance of the transparency of the procedure. In the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case which followed Vinter, the Chamber faulted the lack of specific guidance as to the governing criteria and applicable conditions for the exercise of presidential clemency (the gathering and organisation of personal particulars and the assessment of the request). The suggested remedy, in the Article 46 part of that judgment, was to introduce legislation enabling prisoners \u201cto foresee, with some degree of precision, what they must do to be considered for release and under what conditions\u201d. The point was put even more exactingly in Trabelsi, where the Chamber referred to \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria of which the prisoner had precise cognisance at the time of imposition of the life sentence, whether, while serving his sentence, the prisoner has changed and progressed to such an extent that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds\u201d0.\n28. The Government disagree with the statement in Trabelsi that there need to be \u201cpre-established criteria\u201d for the review of sentence. They consider it neither necessary nor practicable to describe what a whole life prisoner must do, such as in terms of progress towards rehabilitation. In the view of the Government rather, all relevant circumstances must be taken into consideration. The Government\u2019s position does not sit comfortably with Recommendation Rec (2003) 22, in which it is emphasised that the criteria which prisoners have to fulfil in order to be conditionally released should be clear and explicit and Rule 30.3 of the European Prison Rules, which provides that prisoners who are sentenced shall be informed about the time to be served and the possibilities of early release. Likewise, Article 110 (4) of the Rome Statute provides that the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that there are factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the reduction of sentence. These factors are further elaborated in Rules 223 and 224 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence where the following examples are given: the conduct of the sentenced person while in detention, which shows a genuine dissociation from his or her crime; the prospect of the resocialisation and successful resettlement of the sentenced person; whether the early release of the sentenced person would give rise to significant social instability; any significant action taken by the sentenced person for the benefit of the victims as well as any impact on the victims and their families as a result of the early release; individual circumstances of the sentenced person, including a worsening state of physical or mental health or advanced age.\n29. Already at paragraph 128 of Vinter and Others, the Court observed that those directly affected are only given a partial picture of the exceptional conditions which might lead to the exercise of the Secretary of State\u2019s power under section 30. As stated by the applicant, the Lifer Manual is still the only text that is accessible to whole-life prisoners on the subject of the possibility of release. There are still no published criteria. Yet the Court\u2019s case-law gives examples of the factors that are relevant to determining whether a whole-life sentence ought to be reviewed. In Harakchiev and Tolumov, the judgment noted that in the Bulgarian system the circumstances taken into consideration include equity, humanity, compassion, mercy, the health and family situation of the convicted offender, and any positive changes in his or her personality. In \u010ca\u010dko, the basis in domestic law for review is where the prisoner \u201chas demonstrated improvement by fulfilling his or her obligations and by good behaviour, and where it can be expected that the person concerned will behave in an appropriate manner in the future\u201d0. In Bodein, the judgment considered that the prisoner\u2019s application for reduction or variation of sentence will be assessed in the light of the degree of danger he or she poses, his or her behaviour and the evolution in his or her personality. These factors have been regarded by the Court as sufficient to fulfil the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention.\n#### B. The position of the Grand Chamber (\u00a7\u00a7 30-34)\n30. It is true that in the present judgment the Grand Chamber confirms the overarching role of the principle of legality in prison law and specifically in the domain of parole, as well as the prison authorities\u2019 obligation to strive towards a life-sentenced prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation. It is also true that the Grand Chamber adds that the Secretary of State is required to take reasoned decisions on whether to release or not to release in a manner compatible with the Convention, that these decisions are to be judicially appealable, and that this judicial review must involve an \u201cexamination of the merits\u201d of the prisoners\u2019 penological needs. Finally, it is true that the Grand Chamber restates that there should be an automatic parole review after a specific minimum term, in principle 25 years after the imposition of the life sentence, without prejudice to a parole review requested by the prisoner at any time. It is good news that the majority is not prepared to leave the details of such questions to the domestic authorities. But this is only half the picture.\n31. The other, less positive half is that the Grand Chamber is satisfied with the Court of Appeal\u2019s vague reference to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d without any further substantive specification or clarification of these circumstances. The Court of Appeal provided no guidance as to the criteria, respective weight and procedure for assessing the penological needs of further detention of the whole-life prisoner. The Court of Appeal stated that the section 30 power should and would be read in compliance with the Convention and the Court\u2019s case-law. Yet the Court of Appeal did not say what exactly that reading would be. In fact, the Court of Appeal gave a ch\u00e8que en blanc to the Secretary of State, and the Court has nothing to say on this matter in the present judgment. Like Lord Atkin in his dissent in Liversidge v Anderson, I protest against strained construction put by the Court of Appeal and the majority upon words, with the practical effect of giving a Minister boundless power over the liberty of women and men.\n32. This condescendence is further evidenced by the lack of any domestic application of the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation to date. The Government could not provide one single example since the entry into force of section 30 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, or at least since Bieber, of release of a whole-life sentenced individual on the basis of penological grounds. Nor could the Government point to any practice showing that, notwithstanding these flaws, the system does in fact operate in a Convention-compliant way, in terms of basic procedural safeguards, such as disclosure, the right to make oral representations at the review hearing and the right to be given reasons for a negative decision. The absence of any case where the mentioned interpretation was applied only shows that it was, and still is, purely virtual. As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation even contradicts the Government\u2019s policy as stated black on white, urbi et orbi, on the web pages of the United Kingdom Government (\u201cthe person\u2019s never considered for release\u201d)0 and the Sentencing Council, which is a public body of the Ministry of Justice (\u201cthey will never be released from prison\u201d)0. Indeed, the practice of the courts remains faithful to the strict punitive policy of the Government and its Sentencing Council and has paid no heed to the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation, as it is shown in the Sentencing Remarks of Sir John Griffiths Williams, in R v Christopher Halliwell, Bristol Crown Court, 23 September 2016:\n\u201cI am satisfied your offending is exceptionally high and satisfies the criteria for a whole life term and that the Transitional Provisions do not require me to impose a minimum term. Were I to impose a minimum term it would be of such length that you would in all probability never be released. I sentence you to Life Imprisonment and direct there will be a whole life order\u201d;\nthe Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Wilkie, in R v Thomas Mair, Central Criminal Court, 23 November 2016:\n\u201cI have considered this anxiously but have concluded that this offence, as I have described it, is of such a high level of exceptional seriousness that it can only properly be marked by a whole life sentence. That is the sentence which I pass. You will, therefore, only be released, if ever, by the Secretary of State exercising executive clemency on humanitarian grounds to permit you to die at home. Whether or not that occurs will be a matter for the holder of that office at the time\u201d;\nand the Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw, in R v Stephen Port, Central Criminal Court, 25 November 2016:\n\u201cThe sentence therefore upon the counts of murder is a sentence of life imprisonment; I decline to set a minimum term; the result is a whole life sentence and the defendant will die in prison.\u201d\n33. It bears mention at this stage that the Grand Chamber itself admitted the \u201cinaccessibility\u201d of the Court of Appeal\u2019s interpretation in paragraph 65 of the present judgment, in what is obviously a complacent understatement of reality. This complacency goes hand in hand with the diminished role assigned to the Court by the pivotal paragraph 63 of the judgment. In it, the majority is supposed to provide the ultimate justification for not finding a violation. The paragraph disappoints the reader. The present lack of clarity and certainty in the domestic legal framework is saved by the Court\u2019s generous assumption that the Secretary of State will follow a certain policy while exercising section 30 powers, different from that which he has deliberately maintained in force since Vinter and Others.\n34. It is odd that the majority pretend that a future clarification of the law is capable of remedying its present lack of clarity and certainty and thus the violation that exists today, but it is even odder to assume that this clarification will result from the adhesion of the Secretary of State to the Court\u2019s desired policy. In any event, like Judge Kalaydjieva in the Chamber, I fail to see the bearing of the progressive development of the law since the Bieber decision in 2009 on the applicant\u2019s situation a year earlier, in 2008, when his complaints were submitted to the Court, or at the time of their examination by the Chamber in 2015 and the Grand Chamber in 2016.\n### V. What lies ahead for the Convention system? (\u00a7\u00a7 35-47)\n#### A. The seismic consequences of the present judgment for Europe (\u00a7\u00a7 35-40)\n35. The Court of Appeal stated that it was right in Bieber and that the Court was wrong in Vinter and Others. Now, the Grand Chamber is backtracking from Vinter and Others and admitting that the Court of Appeal was right and English law already had, since at least Bieber, a Convention\u2011compatible parole mechanism for lifers. This is not an isolated event. In Al-Khawaja and Tahery, the Grand Chamber accepted the principle set out in the Supreme Court\u2019s Horncastle judgment, and in Horncastle v. the United Kingdom, the Chamber found no violation of Article 6 despite the use of hearsay evidence leading to the conviction. After the Al-Khawaja and Tahery retreat on the issue of conviction based solely or to a decisive extent on hearsay evidence, the RMT regression in the role of other international sources of law in the interpretation of the Convention labour rights, the Animal Defenders reversal on the issue of prohibition of political advertisement, and still suffering from the ongoing Hirst saga on the voting rights of prisoners, the Court is faced with an existential crisis. The pre-catastrophic scenario is now aggravated by the unfortunate spill\u2011over effect of Hirst on the Russian courts.\n36. No great effort is needed to identify the source of the crisis. It lies in the attractive force of the Horncastle \u201crare occasions\u201d argument. The problem is that \u201crare occasions\u201d tend to proliferate and become an example for others to follow suit. Domestic authorities in all member States will be tempted to pick and choose their own \u201crare occasions\u201d when they are not pleased with a certain judgment or decision of the Court in order to evade their international obligation to implement it, especially when the issue is about the protection of minorities, such as prisoners, LGBT people, asylum seekers, migrants, aliens, Roma and other non-State peoples living in Contracting Parties, such as, for example, the Kurdish people, to mention but a few. There is always a minority that the majority is prone to treat as a scapegoat for all the ills in society, by imposing on them objectionable restrictions and limitations on the exercise of Convention rights and freedoms.\n37. The risk of self-interested manipulation becomes intolerably high when domestic authorities pretend that they are only bound by a \u201cclear and constant\u201d line of Strasburg case-law, denying the res interpretata effect to \u201cincongruous\u201d, \u201cstray\u201d, \u201coverly broad\u201d Chamber judgments or even Grand Chamber judgments. The domestic authorities\u2019 test for acceptance of the Court\u2019s judgments guidance then becomes even more discretionary, based on an admittedly very fluid distinction between clear/unclear, constant/not constant case-law, allowing for the rejection of the binding and interpretative force of any Court judgment on new or polemic issues. As if the Convention system did not have its own internal mechanisms for guaranteeing consistency and coherence, including, inter alia, referral to the Grand Chamber and the office of the Jurisconsult. As if any attempt by the Court to enter unchartered waters or to change course had to be accorded an ex post fiat by domestic authorities. As if, ultimately, the domestic authorities were entrusted with the power of Article 19 of the Convention, and not the Court.\n38. In this context, the present judgment may have seismic consequences for the European human-rights protection system. The majority\u2019s decision represents a peak in a growing trend towards downgrading the role of the Court before certain domestic jurisdictions, with the serious risk that the Convention is applied with double standards. If the Court goes down this road, it will end up as a non-judicial commission of highly qualified and politically legitimised 47 experts, which does not deliver binding judgments, at least with regard to certain Contracting Parties, but pronounces mere recommendations on \u201cwhat it would be desirable\u201d for domestic authorities to do, acting in an mere auxiliary capacity, in order to \u201caid\u201d them in fulfilling their statutory and international obligations. The probability of deleterious consequences for the entire European system of human-rights protection is heightened by the current political environment, which shows an increasing hostility to the Court. As one commentator put it:\n\u201cThe Court has never, in its 50-year history, been subject to such a barrage of hostile criticism as that which occurred in the United Kingdom in 2011. Over the years certain governments have discovered that it is electorally popular to criticise international courts such as the Strasbourg court: they are easy targets, particularly because they tend, like all courts, not to answer back.\u201d0\nLord Mance confirms this assessment:\n\u201cI have heard it said that, when the Strasbourg court disagrees with a decision taken in France, the blame is France is directed at the French decision-maker, whereas, in the United Kingdom, it would be directed at the Strasbourg court.\u201d0\nLord Moses is of the same view:\n\u201cCriticism of our judges has been diverted onto foreign judges in an international court... It was hoped that by increasing the power of judges to construe and apply the Convention in solving domestic challenges to the actions of public authorities, the power of the judges in Strasbourg would be reduced. What a paradox, that the attempts to diminish the force of Strasbourg influence should thereafter have merely strengthened vociferous complaint as to the invasive growth of what is condemned as alien jurisprudence!\u201d0\nLord Neuberger calls this campaign \u201cexaggerated\u201d and \u201cslanted\u201d0. In fact, the Strasbourg-sceptic rhetoric is not really new. The easy, superficial scepticism indulged in by the cynics and the contemptuous, inconsequent criticism expanded by the scoffers has always been there. It reflects a deep\u2011rooted attitude vis-a-vis international law and courts, which disputes the universality of human rights.\n39. The fact is that some domestic authorities have always been reluctant to learn from the Court, considering the good of human rights as being for export only, not for import. To put it in the words of Lord Hoffmann:\n\u201c[W]hen we joined, indeed, took the lead in the negotiation of the European Convention, it was not because we thought it would affect our own law, but because we thought it right to set an example for others and to help to ensure that all the Member States respected those basic human rights which were not culturally determined but reflected our common humanity\u201d0.\nIn his 2009 Judicial Studies Board Annual Lecture, Lord Hoffmann made the point even clearer, pledging against uniformity of the application of the Convention \u201cabstract rights\u201d and attacking in severe words \u201cthe basic flaw in the concept of having an international court of human rights to deal with the concrete application of those rights in different countries.\u201d0 The avowed purpose was to put in question the authority of the Court to set European-wide human-rights standards. This approach squares perfectly with a certain Weltanschauung which was aired by Milton\u2019s The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce in these terms: \u201cLet not England forget her precedence of teaching nations how to live.\u201d0\n40. Seen through these lens, the relationship between national law and the Convention is peculiarly unbalanced: the impact of national law on the Convention should be maximised, whereas the impact of the Convention on the domestic law should be minimised, if not downright rejected, sometimes even with an explicit call for solutions that are supposedly home-grown and sensitive to Britain\u2019s legal inheritance and that would enable people to feel they have ownership of their rights. In this context, the \u201chuman rights diversity\u201d argument reveals its real face as a politically unidirectional, sovereigntist card, played with regard to the import of human rights and justifying the refusal of \u201calien\u201d, i.e., Convention standards imposed by an international court. At the same time, the \u201chuman rights diversity\u201d card is consciously downplayed with regard to the export of human rights and the imposition, by means of an international court, of domestic values and policies on the other Contracting Parties. Of course, this also entails a biased understanding of the logical obverse of the doctrine of the \u201cdiversity of human rights\u201d, namely the doctrine of the margin of appreciation0: the margin should be wider for those States which are supposed \u201cto set an example for others\u201d and narrower for those States which are supposed to learn from the example. This evidently leaves the door wide open for certain governments to satisfy their electoral base and protect their favourite vested interests. In my humble view, this is not what the Convention is all about.\n#### B. Argentoratum locutum, iudicium finitum (\u00a7\u00a7 41-47)\n41. Two different situations must be distinguished. When the level of domestic protection of human rights is higher than the one afforded by the Convention, it may be convincingly argued that the European standards set out by the Court are supererogatory. The Convention itself allows for this (Article 53). Nothing prevents the domestic authorities from leaping ahead of the Strasbourg standard in the protection of human rights, and not only on issues that the Court had declared to be within the national margin of appreciation. The \u201cgreater danger\u201d, perceived by Lord Brown, \u201cin the national court construing the Convention too generously in favour of the Applicant than in construing it too narrowly\u201d0, misunderstood this point: from the Strasbourg perspective, there is never an erroneous, \u201ctoo generous\u201d domestic interpretation of the Convention, simply because domestic courts may err on the side of caution, but they certainly do not err on the progressive side. When domestic authorities, courts included, choose the path of a more pro persona Convention interpretation, this interpretation is safeguarded by Article 53.\n42. Also from the UK perspective, the Ullah-type reticence, according to which domestic courts should not go where Strasbourg has not yet gone, or in the words of Lord Brown, should do \u201cno less but certainly no more\u201d0, seems unfounded, and this for a variety of reasons. Firstly, in Ullah Lord Bingham was not concerned with the situation where Strasbourg had not yet pronounced. Secondly, the lack or insufficiency of Strasbourg case-law should not be used to inhibit domestic courts from giving full effect to Convention rights. Such an agnostic, passive position would defraud the obligations of the Contracting Parties as frontline administrators of the Convention. Thirdly, the Human Rights Act itself was meant to allow British judges to \u201ccontribute to this dynamic and evolving interpretation of the Convention\u201d0, in other words, to the development of Convention law on human rights in new directions. So it is entirely correct to hold in this context that Strasbourg is not \u201cthe inevitable and ultimate source of all wisdom\u201d0. One could say, further amending Lord Kerr\u2019s amendment, \u201cArgentoratum non locutum, nunc est nobis loquendum \u2013 Strasbourg has not spoken, now it is our time to speak\u201d0.\n43. But when the domestic level of human-rights protection is lower than that of the Court, when the domestic reading of the Convention rights is more circumscribed than that of Strasbourg, the domestic authorities, courts included, must act as faithful trustees of the Convention values and concede preponderance to the Court\u2019s ultimate and authoritative reading (see Article 19 of the Convention), indeed even over Parliament, the different branches of Government and the judiciary of the United Kingdom. This is not a mere obligation of means, to find, as far as possible, the best possible way of harmonising domestic law and European standards, or to look for a Convention-friendly interpretation of domestic law where such an interpretation appears tenable in view of the traditionally recognised methods of statutory and constitutional interpretation. It is much more than that. It is an obligation of result, to implement fully and in good faith the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions and the principles that they set out. Even though we are dealing with rights under a United Kingdom statute, in reality, the domestic authorities have no choice, as Lord Rodger so brilliantly put it: \u201cArgentoratum locutum, iudicium finitum - Strasbourg has spoken, the case is closed\u201d.0\n44. This is also the understanding ratified at the highest political level by the representatives of the Contracting Parties in the Brighton declaration: \u201cAll laws and policies should be formulated, and all State officials should discharge their responsibilities, in a way that gives full effect to the Convention\u201d0. Or to use the wise words of Lord Neuberger, when he referred to the regrettable Hirst saga: \u201cWe may think that it is inappropriate that Strasbourg pokes its nose into the votes for prisoners\u2019 issues on the basis that it should be left to our Parliament to decide.\u201d But he also added, \u201cIt may be thought to be a small price to pay for a civilised Europe that we sometimes have to adapt our laws a little.\u201d0 And certainly this corresponds to the best international-law tradition of Britain, synthesised in the words of the 1949 Grotius lecture of Professor Lauterpacht when he affirmed\n\u201cthe undeniably large measure of surrender of sovereignty implied in the proposed European Court and Commission of Human Rights... For the proposals imply not only the power, to be vested in international agencies, to investigate and review judicial decisions of the highest municipal tribunals. They imply the authority to review legislative acts of sovereign Parliaments.\u201d\nHe went on with the indication of a long list of \u201cquestions which might arise in Great Britain\u201d, including arbitrary imprisonment. The point was made even more explicitly when he admitted that\n\u201cThese possibilities must be clearly kept in mind and fully disclosed to the point of admission that, in a distinct sense, a portion of national sovereignty will be vested in the seven persons comprising the European Court of Human Rights. After we have done that \u2013 but only after that \u2013 we may be at liberty to urge that some such consummation is inevitable if the proclamation of allegiance to the rights of man is not to remain mere lip service\u201d0.\nOn the same occasion, Mr Barrington, who had been with Sir David Maxwell Fyfe in the meetings of the European Movement and in the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights, stated the visionary, principled position of the British delegation:\n\u201cI think governments will be reluctant to accept anything which involves a surrendering of sovereignty, but it is up to us to break down their reluctance. Anyone who can support the efforts being made in Strasbourg to carry this Convention will make an important contribution to the world-wide cause of human rights.\u201d0\n45. Consequently, domestic authorities, courts included, must act in a way that coheres with the principle of pacta sunt servanda and therefore comply with the letter and abide by the principles underlying the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions, including those delivered against other Contracting Parties. As administrators of first resort of the Convention, the domestic authorities must therefore be deferential to the final say of the Court, which is entrusted with the uniform upholding of the \u201cconstitutional instrument of European public order\u201d0, whenever the domestic level of human-rights protection is lower than that of the Court.\n46. As Lady Hale wrote, \u201cIt stands to reason that, once a State has committed itself to certain minimum standards, it cannot contract out of those by defining the terms used in its own way.\u201d0 Neither the supremacy of Parliament nor the independence of the judiciary may be invoked to fail to perform the Convention obligation of implementation of the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions (Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). The Convention \u201cmakes no distinction as to the type of rule or measure concerned and does not exclude any part of the member States\u2019 \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 from scrutiny under the Convention\u201d0.\n47. As a matter of constitutional law, not even the core of the national constitution, where the political stakes are higher (such as the provisions on the composition of the highest political and judicial bodies of the State), may be determinative in case of conflict with international obligations derived from the Convention and its Protocols. Any other approach, which pays lip service to the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions but ultimately rejects its legal force as res judicata among the parties and res interpretata for all Contracting parties, will breach the principle of pacta sunt servanda and the instrumental precept of good faith (Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). As the first President of the Court, Lord McNair, put it, \u201cthe performance of treaties is subject to an overriding obligation of mutual good faith\u201d0. Either the Convention and the Court\u2019s judgments and decisions are honoured fully and faithfully or friction between Strasbourg and the domestic authorities will become the norm rather than the exception. This would evidently be to the detriment of the individuals and legal persons who come to Strasbourg for justice, and ultimately determinative of the fate of the system itself. The choice between two opposite paths is now clear for Governments all over Europe. Between the isolationist, sovereigntist temptation and the genuine commitment to a \u201cgreater unity\u201d between European States pursuing the \u201cfurther realisation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\u201d0, it is expected that the founding fathers of the system will not be the architects of its demise, and respect for Sir Hersch Lauterpacht\u2019s inspirational legacy and Sir David Maxwell Fyfe\u2019s accomplishing work will prevail.\n### VI. Conclusion (\u00a7\u00a7 48-50)\n48. The \u201cgreat benefits to the law and to a great many people\u201d brought about by the Human Rights Act are unquestionable. As much as the substantive developments that the Court beget in a country in which \u201cthe idea that the citizen might have rights which he could assert against the State itself was unknown to us.\u201d0 But McLoughlin illustrates the potential weakness of the Human Rights Act model, when a domestic court does not take full account of the Strasbourg case-law. The Court of Appeal did not cure the defects of the domestic law following Vinter and Others.\n49. If McLoughlin represents as much as can be achieved judicially to respond to Vinter and Others, then, as already admitted in the proposal of the United Kingdom Parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on Human Rights, amending legislation is required. As Lord Nicholls once stated, \u201cNor can Parliament have intended that section 3 should require courts to make decisions for which they are not equipped. There may be several ways of making provision Convention-compliant, and the choice may involve issues calling for legislative deliberation\u201d0.\n50. In any event, in the case of the present applicant the violation of Article 3 crystallised on 6 October 2008 when the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, confirming the High Court\u2019s finding that there was no reason to depart from the Secretary of State\u2019s decision to impose the whole life term. At least since then he has been deprived of his Article 3 right to parole.\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE SAJ\u00d3\nTo my regret I could not follow the majority, for the reasons expressed in the separate opinion of Judge Paulo Pinto de Albuquerque. Even assuming that \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d may mean anything a judge finds reasonable in the United Kingdom, it certainly cannot provide the specific guidance to the prisoner that was stipulated in Murray v. the Netherlands ([GC], no. 10511/10, \u00a7 100, ECHR 2016) a mere six months ago.", "001-95382": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ER v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that the length of the criminal proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n18. The Government contested that argument.\n19. The period to be taken into consideration began on 10 October 1990 and ended on 2 December 2003. It thus lasted approximately thirteen years and two months for two levels of jurisdiction, including military and ordinary first-instance courts.\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n21. As regards the merits, the Government maintained that the proceedings could not be considered to have been unreasonably long, particularly in view of the complexity of the case, the number of witnesses examined and the great number of offences with which the applicant was charged.\n22. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2000-VII; Szilv\u00e1ssy v. Hungary, no. 17623/04, \u00a7\u00a7 26-34, 1 April 2008). The Court particularly notes in the present case that the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court as many as four times. It reiterates that the repeated quashing and remittal of lower court decisions for re-examination are usually ordered as a result of errors committed by the latter, which, within one set of proceedings, discloses a deficiency in the operation of the legal system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003; Falimonov v. Russia, no. 11549/02, \u00a7 58, 25 March 2008).\n23. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n#### A. Damages and costs and expenses\n24. The applicant claimed 686,306.35 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage on account his salary cuts during the criminal proceedings and the future pension rights he had been denied after his expulsion from the armed forces. He also claimed EUR 50,000 for non\u2011pecuniary damage and EUR 6,000 for costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts.\n25. The Government contested these claims as being unsubstantiated and excessive.\n26. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, the Court considers that the applicant must have suffered some non-pecuniary damage which the finding of a violation of the Convention in the present judgment does not suffice to remedy. Ruling on an equitable basis, in accordance with Article 41, it awards the applicant EUR 9,500 under this head.\n27. As regards the applicant's claim for costs and expenses, the Court makes no award under this head as the applicant has not produced any documents in support of his requests.\n#### B. Default interest\n28. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 9,500 (nine thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 27 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-61177": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF CI\u0104GADLAK v.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 10 June 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained under Articles 3, 4, 5 and 13 of the Convention that the proceedings in his case had exceeded a reasonable time. He did not raise any specific complaints relating to the provisions relied on by him. However, the applicant made explicit reference to the 'reasonable time' requirement. For these reasons, the Court will examine the application under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n18. The Government contested the applicant's argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. The Court will therefore declare it admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The Government's submissions\n20. The Government were of the opinion that the applicant's case was a complex one. They submitted that the examination of that case had depended entirely on the outcome of the proceedings concerning the annulment of the applicant's conviction. The Government further pointed out that the case had related to facts that had taken place more than fifty years before its examination and the court had had to make an inquiry with the Office for the State Protection.\n21. They were of the opinion that the applicant's conduct had not contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n22. The Government stated that the public authorities were partly responsible for the delay. They noted that a large number of claims similar to that of the applicant had been lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court and, although that fact should not exempt the Government from the obligation to ensure the speediness of proceedings, it should be nonetheless taken into consideration. The Government made reference to statistics, according to which the backlog of cases concerning compensation for wrongful convictions had been promptly tackled and the situation had been effectively remedied. Relying on the Court's judgment in the case of Trickovic v. Slovenia (no. 39914/98, 12 June 2001), they recalled that a Contracting State was exonerated from liability for a temporary backlog of court business if it took appropriate remedial action with the requisite promptness.\n23. The Government observed that the Regional Court had attempted to accelerate the submission of the requested documents by the Office for the State Protection.\n24. They were of the view that the examination of the applicant's case had not required special diligence, because after the annulment of his conviction he had received moral satisfaction and what had been at stake for him in the proceedings had been of a pecuniary nature solely.\n25. The Government stated that the proceedings had begun on 19 February 1993 and ended on 19 June 2000.\n##### 2. The applicant's submissions\n26. The applicant submitted that the proceedings had begun on 2 April 1992 and ended on 19 June 2000. He did not agree with the Government's contention that his case had been complex.\n##### 3. The Court's assessment\n27. The period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. However, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time (see, among other authorities, Humen v. Poland [GC], no. 26614/95, \u00a7 59, 15 October 1999, unreported).\nThe Court notes that the parties' submissions as to the starting date of the proceedings differ from each other. It observes that the applicant considered both procedures, the one concerning the annulment of his conviction and the one relating to compensation, as one. The Government regarded only the latter as relevant for the present application. Without prejudice to the issue as to whether the former procedure formed part of the proceedings concerning compensation, the Court notes that, in any event, there is no significant time lapse between the two dates under dispute and they both fall outside the Court's jurisdiction ratione temporis. It will therefore forbear from deciding on which of them the proceedings at issue commenced.\nThe parties agreed that the period under consideration ended on 19 June 2000. It thus lasted seven years, one month and nineteen days, within the Court's jurisdiction ratione temporis.\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n29. The Court considers that the case was not particularly difficult to determine (cf. Ha\u0142ka and Others v. Poland, no. 71891/01, \u00a7 34, 2 July 2002, unreported).\n30. It accepts the Government's submission that the applicant did not contribute to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n31. The Court does not find convincing the Government's contention that the authorities applied effective measures to cope with the influx of compensation claims similar to that of the applicant (see Kurzac v. Poland, no. 31382/96, \u00a7 34, 22 February 2001, unreported, and Ha\u0142ka and Others, cited above, \u00a7 37). It points out that despite the application of those measures the applicant's claim was dealt with for over seven years. In these circumstances the Court cannot accept the Government's view that the remedial action taken by the authorities could absolve them from their liability for the delay in the examination of the applicant's case.\n32. The Court notes that in the course of the proceedings the Regional Court held one hearing on the merits and at the second hearing it gave judgment. Apart from those two hearings practically no other action was taken.\n33. Having regard to the specific nature of the applicant's claim and the fact that he could raise it only over forty years after his conviction, the Court does not agree with the Government's opinion that what was at stake for the applicant was of a merely pecuniary nature (see Ha\u0142ka and Others, cited above, \u00a7 37).\n34. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the applicant's case was not heard within a reasonable time. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n35. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n36. The applicant did not claim any particular sum in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. He requested that the Court reach \u201ca conclusion which would satisfy him both morally and materially\u201d.\n37. The Court is of the view that the applicant can reasonably be deemed to have suffered non-pecuniary damage on account of the length of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Court considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case and deciding on an equitable basis, the applicant should be awarded 6,000 euros.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n38. The applicant did not seek to be reimbursed for any costs or expenses in connection with the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n39. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28957/95, \u00a7 124, to be published in ECHR 2002\u2011VI).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 1 July 2003, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O'Boyle Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-84289": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KO\u0141ODZI\u0143SKI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 33-39, 4 May 2006.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that his detention was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n...\u201d\n15. The Court notes, however, that the applicant\u2019s detention was based on Article 258 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that he was detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed a serious offence (see paragraph 7 above). It accordingly finds that the decision to place the applicant in custody had a legal basis and was issued by the competent judicial authority. There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined or, therefore, lacked the degree of foreseeability required by the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Moreover, the Court does not discern any appearance of arbitrariness in the decisions of the relevant judicial authorities on the applicant\u2019s detention. It also observes that the lawfulness of the detention was repeatedly reviewed by the competent domestic courts (see Malik v. Poland, no. 57447/00, \u00a7 26, 4 April 2006).\n16. Against that background, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention simultaneously.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about unfairness of the proceedings in that he had been convicted despite being innocent. However, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law ...\u201d\n19. The Court finds that the applicant did not file a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against the final judgment of the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court of 26 September 2006.\n20. In that regard, the Court observes that under Polish law and in accordance with the practice of the Supreme Court a cassation appeal can be brought by a party alleging a flagrant breach of any substantive or procedural provision of law capable of affecting the substance of the judgment (see, Kucharski v. Poland (dec.), no. 51521/99, 16 October 2003).\n21. The cassation appeal was therefore a remedy that would have permitted the applicant to submit the substance of the present complaint to the domestic authorities effectively and to seek relief.\n22. It follows that the complaint is inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The Court raised of its own motion an issue under Article 8 of the Convention on account of the fact that the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court had been censored. The relevant part of this provision reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s preliminary objection on exhaustion of domestic remedies\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all available domestic remedies. He had failed to bring an action under Article 24 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, in conjunction with Article 448 of the Civil Code. These provisions would have allowed him to assert that by censoring his correspondence the authorities had breached his personal rights protected by the Civil Code and to make a claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n25. The Government further submitted that the provisions of the Civil Code were reinforced by the provisions of the Polish Constitution, in particular Article 49 (which protects the freedom and secrecy of communication) and Article 77 (which secures to everyone the possibility of seeking redress for damage caused by a public authority).\n26. In this connection, the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006 in which a prisoner had been awarded PLN 5,000 in damages from the State Treasury for a breach of the confidentiality of his correspondence with the Central Board of the Prison Service and the Central Electoral Office. The Regional Court held that the confidentiality of correspondence was a personal right protected under Article 23 of the Civil Code whose breach could entitle the claimant to an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n27. The applicant did not comment.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n28. The Court notes that the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention concerning the alleged censorship of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was raised ex officio. The two letters at issue were sent by the applicant to the Court and he could not have been aware that they had been censored by the authorities. In these circumstances, the applicant cannot be required to bring any domestic proceedings in order to obtain redress for the alleged breach of his right to respect for his correspondence.\n29. Even had the applicant complained about the censorship of his letters to the Court, it has to be noted that the alleged interference with his correspondence occurred in 2004 and 2005, whereas the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006.\nAny relevance the latter judgment might have to the present case is therefore reduced by the fact that it was delivered after the relevant time (see, for example, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 57, ECHR 1999\u2011IX). Furthermore, the Court observes that the judgment relied on by the Government was given by a first-instance court.\n30. For these reasons, the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n##### 3. Conclusion as to admissibility\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The submissions before the Court\n32. The applicant submitted in general terms that the circumstances of his case disclosed a breach of the Convention.\n33. The Government, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and the Court\u2019s case-law, refrained from expressing their opinion on the merits of the application.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) Existence of an interference\n34. The Court first observes that the applicant\u2019s letter of 24 November 2004 bears a stamp marked \u201ccensored\u201d, \u201cthe prosecutor\u201d, followed by an illegible signature. In addition, the envelope had been opened and resealed with adhesive tape (see paragraph 11 above).\n35. The Court further notes that the application form submitted by the applicant and dated 13 January 2005 bears a stamp marked \u201ccensored\u201d, \u201cthe judge\u201d, followed by an illegible signature. The envelope bears a stamp indicating that the applicant\u2019s letter was received and dispatched by the prison administration on 18 January 2005. However, according to the postmark the letter was posted with a 13 day delay. It appears that the envelope was cut open and subsequently resealed with adhesive tape (see paragraph 12 above).\n36. The Court has held on many occasions that as long as the Polish authorities continue the practice of marking detainees\u2019 letters with the \u201ccensored\u201d stamp, the Court has no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read (see Matwiejczuk v. Poland, no. 37641/97, \u00a7 99, 2 December 2003; Pisk-Piskowski v. Poland, no. 92/03, \u00a7 26, 14 June 2005; and Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7 58, 4 May 2006). It follows that in respect of the applicant\u2019s letter there was an \u201cinterference\u201d with his right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8.\n37. It follows that the opening, reading and delaying of the applicant\u2019s letters to the Court amounted to an \u201cinterference\u201d with his right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8.\n(b) Whether the interference was \u201cin accordance with law\u201d\n38. The Court reiterates that any \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the right to respect for correspondence will contravene Article 8 of the Convention unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve them (see, among many other authorities, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 32, \u00a7 84; Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 16, \u00a7 34, and Niedba\u0142a v. Poland no. 27915/95, \u00a7 78).\n39. The Government noted that the impugned interference took place on two occasions between 24 November 2004 and 31 January 2005 when the applicant was in detention on remand. The Government referred to the amendments introduced to the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences on 24 July 2003, but did not point to a concrete basis in the domestic law that would justify such interference.\n40. The Court observes that, according to Article 214 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, persons detained on remand enjoy the same rights as those convicted by a final judgment. Accordingly, the prohibition of censorship of correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights contained in Article 103 of the same Code, which expressly relates to convicted persons, is also applicable to detained persons (see Michta v. Poland no. 13425/02, \u00a7 61, 4 May 2006; and Kwiek v. Poland, no. 51895/99, \u00a7 44, 30 May 2006). Thus, censorship of the applicant\u2019s letters to the Court was contrary to the domestic law. It follows that the interference in the present case was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.\n41. That being so, the Court does not consider it necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with. Consequently, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n42. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n43. The applicant claimed 30,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n44. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s claim was excessive and linked to the applicant\u2019s detention on remand. They asked the Court to rule that a finding of a violation of Article 8 constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction. In the alternative, they invited the Court to assess the amount of just satisfaction on the basis of its case-law in similar cases and having regard to national economic circumstances.\n45. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged. It therefore rejects this claim.\nOn the other hand, it considers that the applicant has suffered non\u2011pecuniary damage which is not sufficiently compensated for by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Considering the circumstances of the case, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n46. The applicant submitted no claim in respect of costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n47. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 8 January 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Nicolas Bratza\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-93304": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASES OF WALTO\u015a and PAWLICZ v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicants complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 1 August 1997 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted for 11 years and 8 months for 2 levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government raised a preliminary objection that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies available to them under Polish law, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that the applicants had failed to appeal against the decision of 24 November 1998 to stay the proceedings.\n22. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s objection concerns a matter which goes to the issue of the applicants\u2019 conduct and their contribution, if any, to the length of the proceedings. It will accordingly address this issue at the merits stage. It further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible. Finally, the Court considers it appropriate to join the applications.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n24. The Court notes that the proceedings were stayed until the termination of other proceedings which were decisive for the outcome of the case (see paragraph 6 above). In so far as the Government argue that the applicants failed to appeal against the decision of 24 November 1998 to stay the proceedings (see paragraph 21 above), the Court considers that the State remains responsible also for delays in proceedings the outcome of which is necessary for the examination of another case. In any event, the Court is of the view that where no final decision on the merits of the present cases has been given after they have been pending for over eleven years, the State cannot be considered to have shown due diligence in ensuring their proper conduct. The period of seventeen months during which the proceedings were stayed upon the applicants\u2019 request (see paragraph 8 above) cannot justify the overall length of the proceedings.\n25. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present cases (see Frydlender, cited above). Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In particular, the Court notes that no hearing was held in 2006 and there were substantial delays in obtaining the expert opinion (see paragraphs 10-11 above).\n26. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant cases the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n28. The applicants claimed 15,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n29. The Government contested the claim.\n30. The Court considers that the applicants must have sustained non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards each of them EUR 5,000 under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicants also claimed PLN 3,000 (EUR 660) each for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n32. The Government did not express an opinion on the matter.\n33. The Court considers, having regard to the documents in its possession, that the applicants should be awarded jointly EUR 800.\n#### C. Default interest\n34. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Joins the applications and declares them admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay each applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and, jointly, EUR 800 (eight hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 July 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-91290": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF JA\u0141OWIECKI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n13. A detailed rendition of the provisions of the relevant domestic law is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, ECHR 2007\u2011...\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n14. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all relevant domestic remedies as required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that neither at the appellate nor at the cassation stage had the applicant alleged, even in substance, any infringement of his right to a fair hearing as presented in his subsequent complaint to the Court. In particular, the applicant had not questioned the alleged restrictions on his access to the case file and on taking notes from it. Nor had he complained that he could not present his arguments in accordance with the principles of an adversarial hearing and equality of arms.\n15. The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. Had the applicant been of the opinion that the legal provisions on which the courts had based their decisions or their interpretation \u2013 namely Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in conjunction with section 52 \u00a7 2 of the Lustration Act \u2013 had breached his rights, in particular his right to a fair hearing enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution, he should have lodged a constitutional complaint. In particular, the applicant should have requested the Constitutional Court to examine whether the rules imposed by those provisions had violated his right to a fair trial.\n16. The Government further submitted that the application had been lodged outside the time-limit of six months as the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case had been given on 1 February 2007 while he had lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007.\n17. The applicant disagreed. He submitted that the rules governing access to the case file and the manner in which the lustration proceedings had been conducted could not have been effectively challenged in an appeal or cassation appeal as they were provided for by the domestic law. As regards the constitutional complaint, he submitted that it had been an extraordinary remedy which he had not been obliged to exhaust. Finally, he submitted that the decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007, and that he had lodged his application with the Court within less than six months from that date. The applicant provided a copy of an envelope from the Supreme Court, and a delivery receipt, confirming that the reasoned decision of the Supreme Court of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n18. The Court firstly observes that it has already found that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applied to lustration proceedings (see, Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, ECHR 2006\u2011... and Bobek v. Poland (dec.), no. 68761/01, 24 October 2006).\n19. The Court also considers that the question of whether the applicant could effectively challenge the set of legal rules governing access to the case file and setting out the features of the lustration proceedings is linked to the Court\u2019s assessment of Poland\u2019s compliance with the requirements of a \u201cfair trial\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Matyjek v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 42, Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, \u00a7 46, 15 January 2008).\n20. The Court accordingly joins the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to the merits of the case.\n21. The Court further notes that the Government alleged that the applicant had introduced his application out of time and that it should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. However, the Court observes that it appears from the documents provided by the applicant that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision, the object and purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment (see Worm v. Austria, \u00a7 33, 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007 thus within less than six months from the date of notification. It could not be therefore said that the application was introduced out of time. The Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.\n22. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the lustration proceedings had been unfair. Article 6 of the Convention provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ...by [a] ... tribunal...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\n(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.\u201d\n#### A. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n24. The applicant argued that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected in his case. He had been hindered in his access to the case file and thus could not defend himself properly against the allegations raised by the Commissioner of the Public Interest. Furthermore, he had been entirely deprived of a possibility to participate in the proceedings before the Commissioner and to access the case file prepared by him. He could not question the Commissioner\u2019s decision to choose the documents to be considered as evidence against him. He also complained about his lustration trial, in particular, about the rules governing the consultation of the case file in the secret registry. He referred to the case of Matyjek v. Poland and complained that he could not freely consult confidential documents and had been prevented from removing any notes he had made in the secret registry. The applicant submitted that he had been placed at a significant disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the Commissioner who had had access to all documents and archives.\n25. The applicant considered misleading the Government\u2019s assessment that the evidence classified as secret had constituted only a minor part of his file. He submitted that some very important documents remained classified as secret and that he had a very limited access to them. These included the Militia\u2019s files which had constituted the main evidence against the applicant, receipts that he had accepted the money, the documents in which he had allegedly agreed to cooperate etc. Moreover, all the documents presented to the court by the Commissioner had been photocopies made from microfilms, which raised doubts as to their quality and genuineness. The applicant maintained that the classified evidence in his case covered documents produced by the former security services a long time ago which were no longer important for protecting the State\u2019s interest. Their confidentiality, however severely curtailed the applicant\u2019s rights of defence in the lustration proceedings. As a result, he could not challenge the version of events put forward by the Commissioner.\n#### B. The Government\u2019s submissions\n26. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial had been respected in the instant case. They submitted that part of the evidentiary material in the applicant\u2019s case had been classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d under the 1982 Protection of State Secrets Act. Afterwards, the State Security Bureau upheld the \u201csecret\u201d classification of those documents on the basis of the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act. The classified character of those documents had influenced the course of the proceedings; however it had had no adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. Moreover, most of the evidence collected in the case file and the reasoning of the court judgments had not been classified.\n27. The Government argued that under the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act and Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the evidence in the case, having been regarded as classified information, had been available to the parties only in the secret registry of the lustration court. They maintained that both parties to the proceedings, that is, the applicant and the Commissioner of the Public Interest, had been subject to the same strict rules governing access to the file deposited in the secret registry, in particular those regarding the taking of notes. The notes from the case file had to be made in a special notebook which was subsequently placed in an envelope, sealed and deposited in the secret registry.\n28. Furthermore, the Government observed that the need to protect the public interest may justify withholding certain evidence from the defence in criminal proceedings (Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom, nos. 39647/98 and 40461/98, \u00a7 53, 22 July 2003). However, they underlined that in the present case all evidence had been disclosed to the applicant. The only difficulty had been related to the classified nature of the evidence which had resulted in the application of particular arrangements as far as access to the case file had been concerned.\n29. The Government concluded that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n30. The Court firstly reiterates that the guarantees in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set forth in general in paragraph 1. For this reason it considers it appropriate to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under the two provisions taken together (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247\u2011B, p. 34, \u00a7 33).\n31. According to the principle of equality of arms, as one of the features of the wider concept of a fair trial, each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis his opponent (see, for example, Jespers v. Belgium, no. 8403/78, Commission decision of 15 October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 27, p. 61; Foucher v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011II, \u00a7 34; and Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports 1996\u2011II, p. 380-81, \u00a7 47). The Court further reiterates that in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996\u2011II, p. 471, \u00a7 72, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997\u2011III, p. 712, \u00a7 54).\n32. The Court had already dealt with the issue of lustration proceedings in the Turek v. Slovakia case (no. 57986/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2006\u2011... (extracts)) and in \u0100damsons v. Latvia (no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008). In the Turek case the Court held in particular that, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities of contradicting the security agency\u2019s version of the facts will be severely curtailed.\nThose considerations remain relevant to the instant case despite some differences with the lustration proceedings in Poland (see Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 56)\n33. Turning to the instant case, the Court observes firstly that the Government have pointed to the series of successive laws on the basis of which the communist-era security services\u2019 materials continued to be regarded as a State secret. Thus, at least part of the documents relating to the applicant\u2019s lustration case had been classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d. The Court has considered the powers vested in the Head of the State Security Bureau, in particular to uphold or lift the confidentiality rating, inconsistent with the fairness of lustration proceedings, including with the principle of equality of arms (see Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 57).\n34. Secondly, the Court notes that, at the pre-trial stage, the Commissioner of the Public Interest had a right of access, in the secret registry of his office or of the Institute of National Remembrance, to all materials relating to the lustrated person created by the former security services. After the institution of the lustration proceeding, the applicant could also access his court file. However, pursuant to Article 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 52 (2) of the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act, no copies could be made of materials contained in the court file and confidential documents could be consulted only in the secret registry of the lustration court.\nFurthermore, it has not been disputed by the parties that, when consulting his case file, the applicant had been authorised to make notes. However, any notes he took could be made only in special notebooks that were subsequently sealed and deposited in the secret registry. The notebooks could not be removed from this registry and could be opened only by the person who had made them (see Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 58).\n35. The Court reiterates that the accused\u2019s effective participation in his criminal trial must equally include the right to compile notes in order to facilitate the conduct of his defence, irrespective of whether or not he is represented by counsel (see Pullicino v. Malta (dec.), no 45441/99, 15 June 2000 and Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 59). The fact that the applicant could not remove his own notes, taken in the secret registry, in order to show them to an expert or to use them for any other purpose, effectively prevented him from using the information contained in them as he had to rely solely on his memory.\nRegard being had to what was at stake for the applicant in the lustration proceedings - not only his good name but also a ban on being a Member of Parliament or holding public office for 10 years - the Court considers that it was important for him to have unrestricted access to those files and unrestricted use of any notes he made, including, if necessary, the possibility of obtaining copies of relevant documents (see Foucher, cited above, \u00a7 36).\n36. Thirdly, the Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that at the trial stage the same limitations as regards access to confidential documents applied to the Commissioner of the Public Interest. Under the domestic law, the Commissioner, who was a public body, had been vested with powers identical to those of a public prosecutor. Under section 17(e) of the Lustration Act, the Commissioner of the Public Interest had a right of access to full documentation relating to the lustrated person created by, inter alia, the former security services. If necessary, he could hear witnesses and order expert opinions. The Commissioner also had at his disposal a secret registry with staff who obtained official clearance allowing them access to documents considered to be State secrets and were employed to analyse lustration declarations in the light of the existing documents and to prepare the case file for the lustration trial.\n37. The Court has held that lustration measures are by their nature temporary and the necessity to continue such proceedings diminishes with time (see \u0100damsons, cited above, \u00a7 116). It has been recognised by the Court that at the end of the 1990s the State had an interest in carrying out lustration in respect of persons holding the most important public functions. The Court has also accepted that a similar interest was still legitimate at the beginning of the current decade, at least in respect of parliamentary elections (see Chodynicki v. Poland (dec.), no 17625/05, 2 September 2008). However, it reiterates that if a State adopts lustration measures, it must ensure that the persons affected thereby enjoy all procedural guarantees under the Convention in respect of any proceedings relating to the application of such measures (see Turek, cited above, \u00a7 115, Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 62 and \u0100damsons, cited above, \u00a7 116).\nThe Court accepts that there may be a situation in which there is a compelling State interest in maintaining secrecy of some documents, even those produced under the former regime. Nevertheless, such a situation will only arise exceptionally given the considerable time that has elapsed since the documents were created. It is for the Government to prove the existence of such an interest in the particular case because what is accepted as an exception must not become a norm. The Court considers that a system under which the outcome of lustration trials depends to a considerable extent on the reconstruction of the actions of the former secret services, while most of the relevant materials remains classified as secret and the decision to maintain the confidentiality is left within the powers of the current secret services, creates a situation in which the lustrated person\u2019s position is put at a clear disadvantage.\n38. In the light of the above, the Court considers that due to the confidentiality of the documents and the limitations on access to the case file by the lustrated person, as well as the privileged position of the Commissioner of the Public Interest in the lustration proceedings, the applicant\u2019s ability to prove that the contacts he had had with the communist\u2011era secret services did not amount to \u201cintentional and secret collaboration\u201d within the meaning of the Lustration Act were severely curtailed. Regard being had to the particular context of the lustration proceedings, and to the cumulative application of those rules, the Court considers that they placed an unrealistic burden on the applicant in practice and did not respect the principle of equality of arms.\n39. It remains to be ascertained whether the applicant could have successfully challenged the features of the lustration proceedings in his appeal and cassation appeal. Given the Government\u2019s assertion that the rules on access to the materials classified as secret were regulated by the successive laws on State secrets and Article 156 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure and that those legal provisions were complied with in this case, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant, in his appeals or cassation appeals, could have successfully challenged the domestic law in force. In so far as the Government rely on the constitutional complaint, the Court points, firstly, to the fact that the Lustration Act had on several occasions been unsuccessfully challenged before the Constitutional Court (see Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), cited above). Moreover, the Court has held that a constitutional complaint was an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention only in situations where the alleged violation of the Convention resulted from the direct application of a legal provision considered by the complainant to be unconstitutional (see, Szott-Medy\u0144ska v. Poland (dec.), no. 47414/99, 9 October 2003; Pachla v. Poland (dec.), no. 8812/02, 8 November 2005). In this connection, the Court observes that the breach of the Convention complained of in the present case cannot be said to have originated from any single legal provision or even from a well\u2011defined set of provisions. It rather resulted from the way in which the relevant laws were applied to the applicant\u2019s case and, in particular, Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, allowing the President of the Lustration Court to limit the applicant\u2019s access to the case file and his possibilities of taking notes and copying documents (see Bobek, cited above, \u00a7 73 and Luboch, cited above, \u00a7 71). In that connection the Court points to the established case-law of the Constitutional Court, according to which constitutional complaints based solely on the allegedly wrongful interpretation of a legal provision are excluded from its jurisdiction (see Palusi\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), cited above). The Government did not refer to any other domestic remedy which could have offered reasonable prospects of success in this case.\n40. It follows that it has not been shown that the applicant had an effective remedy at his disposal under domestic law by which to challenge the legal framework setting out the features of lustration proceedings. Consequently, the Government\u2019s objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies should be rejected.\n41. In these circumstances the Court concludes that the lustration proceedings against the applicant, taken as a whole, cannot be considered as fair within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention taken together with Article 6 \u00a7 3. There has accordingly been a breach of those provisions.\n### III. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n42. Lastly, the applicant alleged that the Lustration Act had violated Article 7 of the Convention in that the definitions employed by it had been ambiguous. He complained about a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in that the Lustration Act had required him to self-assess his moral and ethical conduct from a few decades ago. The applicant also submitted that the fact that decision-making in the lustration proceedings had been vested in specially established courts had given rise to a breach of Article 2 of Protocol No. 7 to the Convention.\n43. The Court has examined the remainder of the complaints as submitted by the applicant. However, having regard to all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaints (see Chodynicki v. Poland (dec), no. 17625/05 , 2 September 2008 and Luboch, cited above, \u00a7 79). It follows that this part of the application must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n45. The applicant claimed 50,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n46. The Government contested the claim in respect of pecuniary damage. If the Court were to find a violation in the present case, they invited the Court to rule that the finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant.\n47. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged. It is not for the Court to speculate on what might have been the outcome of the proceedings had they complied with the fairness requirements of Article 6 (Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2006-...). It therefore rejects this claim. The Court also considers that in the particular circumstances of the case the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage which may have been sustained by the applicant (see, Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 69).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n48. The applicant also claimed 17,400 Polish zlotys (PLN) (approximately EUR 4,600) for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and PLN 13,300 (approximately EUR 3,500) for those incurred before the Court. As regards the first amount, it included court fees for the cassation and appeal proceedings in the amount of PLN 1,681 and PLN 750 respectively and PLN 15,000 for the costs of legal representation of the applicant before the domestic courts at three instances as documented by the copies of invoices. With respect to the costs of the proceedings before the Court the applicant\u2019s lawyer provided copies of invoices for the costs of legal representation, travel and translation.\n49. The Government considered that these claims were excessive.\n50. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 3,000 covering costs under all heads.\n#### C. Default interest\n51. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Joins to the merits the Government\u2019s preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies;\n2. Declares the complaint under Article 6 of the Convention regarding the unfairness of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 and dismisses, in consequence, the Government\u2019s preliminary objection;\n4. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 17 February 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-89128": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LIDIA NOWAK v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. On 3 July 2008 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 15,000 (the equivalent of approx. EUR 4,600). The Government invited the Court to strike out the application in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n23. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. She maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n24. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n25. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof. The Court will have regard in this connection to the compatibility of the amount with its own awards in similar length of proceedings cases, bearing in mind the principles which it has developed for determining victim status and for assessing the amount of non-pecuniary compensation to be awarded where it has found a breach of the reasonable\u2011time requirement (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 85\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011...,; Scordino v. Italy (no.1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 193-215, ECHR-2006-...; and Dubjakova v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 10 October 2004).\n26. On the facts and for the reasons set out above, in particular the low amount of compensation proposed which is substantially less than the Court would award in similar case, the Court finds that the Government have failed to provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require it to continue its examination of the case (see, conversely, Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z o.o. WAZA v. Poland (striking out), no. 11602/02, 26 June 2007).\n27. This being so, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of its list of cases under Article 37 of the Convention and will accordingly pursue its examination of the admissibility and merits of the case.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n29. The Government refrained from taking a position on the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n30. The period to be taken into consideration began on 17 June 1994 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted over 14 years for one court instance.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Government acknowledged that the applicant had exhausted the remedies available under Polish law.\n32. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n34. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n35. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In particular, the Court notes that even if some delays were caused by the applicant\u2019s husband it was the trial court\u2019s responsibility to discipline the parties in order to conclude the proceedings in a reasonable time (see paragraph 20 above).\nHaving regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations that his complaint about a breach of her right to a trial within a reasonable time was not effective, the Court considered it appropriate to raise of its own motion the issue of Poland\u2019s compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention on account of indications that the applicant had no effective domestic remedy in respect of the protracted length of proceedings in his case. Article 13 reads:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n37. The Government refrained from making any comments in this respect.\n38. The Court reiterates that Article 13 guarantees an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hear a case within a reasonable time. However, the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of that provision does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 154 et seq., ECHR 2000-XI, \u00a7\u00a7 156-157).\n39. While the subsidiarity principle underlying the Convention system requires the Contracting States to introduce a mechanism addressing complaints about the excessive length of proceedings within the national legal system, they are afforded \u2013 subject to compliance with the requirements of the Convention \u2013 some discretion as to the manner in which they provide individuals with the relief required by Article 13 and conform to their Convention obligation under that provision. In particular, where the State has introduced a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave to it a wide margin of appreciation and allow it to organise the remedy \u2013 including the interpretation and application of the notion of \u201cdamage\u201d in a given case \u2013 in a manner consistent with its own legal system, traditions and the standard of living in the country concerned (see Kud\u0142a ibid.; and Scordino v. Italy (no.1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 188-189, ECHR-2006-...).\n40. The fact that in the present case the applicant\u2019s complaint under the 2004 Act failed and that she did not obtain any redress from the domestic court does not in itself render the remedy under the 2004 Act incompatible with Article 13.\n41. As stated above, the expression \u201ceffective remedy\u201d used in Article 13 cannot be interpreted as a remedy bound to succeed, but simply an accessible remedy before an authority competent to examine the merits of a complaint (see, e.g., \u0160idlov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 50224/99, \u00a7 77, 26 September 2006).\n42. In the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case it cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s right to an effective remedy under Article 13 of the Convention has not been respected.\n43. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n45. The applicant claimed EUR 80,000 in respect of pecuniary and non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n46. The Government did not comment on this claim.\n47. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 13,200 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n48. The applicant submitted no claim for costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n49. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of its list of cases;\n2. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 13,200 (thirteen thousand two hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 21 October 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Nicolas Bratza\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-79069": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF JAGIE\u0141\u0141O v.

The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005\u2011V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005\u2011V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS.\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 28 February 1996 and ended on 29 April 2005. It thus lasted nine years and two months for two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s first preliminary objection\n21. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that he had not lodged a civil claim for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of the proceedings with the Polish civil courts under Article 417 of the Civil Court.\n22. The applicant generally contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n23. The Court notes that the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings under the 2004 Act and the Warsaw Regional Curt confirmed on 16 November 2004 that the proceedings had been lengthy. The Court has already examined that remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and found it effective in respect of complaints about the excessive length of judicial proceedings in Poland (see Michalak v. Poland (dec.) no. 24549/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43).\n24. Furthermore, the Court has already held that having exhausted the available remedy provided by the 2004 Act, the applicant was not required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for compensation (see Cichla v. Poland no. 18036/03, \u00a7 26, 10 October 2006).\n25. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies. It follows that the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non\u2011exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n##### 2. The Government\u2019s second preliminary objection\n26. The Government submitted that the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention as the Warsaw Regional Court in its decision of 16 November 2005 had acknowledged that the length of the proceedings in the present case had been excessive. The fact that the Regional Court had awarded no just satisfaction to the applicant could not affect the position, as the fees which he had paid when lodging the complaint had been returned to him.\n27. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n28. The Court recalls that an applicant\u2019s status as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention depends, inter alia, on whether the redress afforded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he complains before the Court was adequate and sufficient having regard to Article 41 of the Convention.\n29. In the present case the Regional Court found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing without unjustified delay. However, it awarded him no just satisfaction. In these circumstances the Court is not satisfied that the redress obtained at domestic level was sufficient to deprive the applicant of the status of a victim for the purpose of Article 34 of the Convention. The Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed (see Palgutova v. Slovakia, no. 9818/02, 17 May 2005 \u00a7 47-49).\n30. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n31. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II)\n32. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France, cited above).\n33. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case\u2011law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n34. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n35. The applicant also complained that the proceedings in his case were unfair. In particular, he alleged errors of fact and law committed by the courts. He alleged a breach of Articles 6 \u00a7 3 (a) and 13 of the Convention. These complaints fall to be examined under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n36. However, the Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.\n37. In the present case the applicant did not allege any particular failure to respect his right to a fair hearing on the part of the relevant courts. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court finds no indication that the impugned proceedings were conducted unfairly.\n38. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill\u2011founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n39. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n40. The applicant claimed PLN 360,000 [EUR 90,000] in respect of pecuniary and non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n41. The Government contested these claims.\n42. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 4,800 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n43. The applicant also claimed PLN 310.60 [EUR 77] for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and PLN 477.60 [EUR 120] for those incurred before the Court. These sums concerned in particular postage expenses.\n44. The Government contested these claims.\n45. According to the Court\u2019s case\u2011law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 120 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n46. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the criminal proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,800 (four thousand eight hundred euros) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage and EUR 120 (one hundred and twenty euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above\u2011mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at the rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 23 January 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

Mijovi\u0107,\nMr J. \u0160ikuta,\nMrs P. Hirvel\u00e4, judges,\nand Mr T.L. Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 13 February 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant constitutional provisions\n13. Article 41 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cInviolability and liberty of the person shall be afforded to everyone. Any deprivation or limitation of liberty may be imposed only in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down by statute.\u201d\n#### B. Conditional release of a person serving a prison sentence\n14. Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the 1997 Criminal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cThe court may conditionally release a person serving a prison sentence from serving the remainder of that sentence only when his/her behaviour, characteristics, personal circumstances and way of life prior to the commission of the offence, the circumstances in which the offence was committed and his/her behaviour following the commission of the offence and while serving a sentence, would justify a conclusion that, following [conditional] release, the person would abide by the law and, in particular, would not re-offend.\u201d\nArticle 78 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the Criminal Code prescribes the minimum prison term, depending on the type of sentence and offender, which must be served before a convicted person may apply for conditional release. However, the decision to grant conditional release is left to the discretion of the court, which must be satisfied that the conditions laid down in Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code are met.\n#### C. Execution of a decision granting conditional release\n15. When conditional release is granted, a convicted person should be released on completion of the necessary administrative formalities as specified in the Ordinance (Zarz\u0105dzenie) of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 on Administrative Acts concerning Execution of Pre-Trial Detention and Sentences and Coercive Measures resulting in Deprivation of Liberty.\nParagraph 3 of that Ordinance states, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cAll administrative formalities shall be carried out without delay (niezw\u0142ocznie) ... This concern in particular (...) transmission of information and official notifications ... and releasing.\u201d\nParagraph 104.2 of the Ordinance provides that the convicted person should be released upon receipt of a copy of the enforceable decision granting him or her the conditional release. The release should be effected on the day of the receipt of the relevant documents by the prison (\u00a7 104.3 of the Ordinance).\nThe Ordinance does not prescribe any specific time-frame for the execution of the decisions granting conditional release.\n#### D. The State's liability for torts committed by its officials\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the State's liability for torts committed by its officials are set out in paragraphs 34-37 of the Court's judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, ECHR 2005\u2013V (extracts).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained about a delay of over 48 hours in his release from prison following the final decision granting him conditional release given by the Court of Appeal in the morning of 12 April 2000. He relied on Article 5 of the Convention, which reads, in its relevant part, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n...\u201d\n18. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The arguments of the parties\n20. The applicant submitted that on 12 April 2000 at 9 a.m. the Cracow Court of Appeal had upheld the Regional Court's decision granting him conditional release. The applicant argued that he should have been released on the same day, given that the distance between Cracow and Tarn\u00f3w was only about 100 km. Nevertheless, he had been released from prison only on 14 April 2000 at 4 p.m.\n21. The Government submitted that the Convention permitted deprivation of liberty only in those cases which were enumerated in Article 5 and only in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention provided for the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court. This category of permissible detention concerned any prisoner serving a sentence where \u201cthe lawful detention\u201d was based on \u201cconviction by a competent court\u201d. This normally referred to a prison sentence, although that was not specifically indicated in the text. The Government further observed that the execution of a prison sentence was, as a rule, dependent on a further decision which was not a matter for the courts but for the prosecution or prison authorities. The actual order to serve the sentence might not therefore emanate from a \u201ccompetent court\u201d but the detention would still be lawful under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a). This would be so even where a prisoner's conditional release was revoked for a breach of the conditions, entailing re-imprisonment for the remaining term.\n22. The Government submitted that in the present case the applicant had been serving a prison sentence in Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002. Thus, the Government maintained that his detention had been lawful in that it was based on a conviction by a competent court.\n23. The Government further argued that the applicant had been released as soon as the decision on his conditional release had been served on the prison governor. Having regard to the foregoing, they maintained that his detention between 12 April 2000 and 14 April 2000 had been lawful under the Convention and in conformity with the applicable domestic law, in particular the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 on Administrative Acts concerning Execution of Pre-Trial Detention and Sentences and Coercive Measures resulting in Deprivation of Liberty.\n24. Finally, the Government noted that the applicant could have lodged a compensation claim against the State Treasury under Article 417 of the Civil Code if he had considered that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty between 12 and 14 April 2000.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n25. The Court recalls that Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the fundamental right to liberty and security. That right is of primary importance in a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d within the meaning of the Convention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 36, \u00a7 65, and Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 16, \u00a7 37). Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2006\u2011...).\n26. All persons are entitled to the protection of that right, that is to say, not to be deprived, or to continue to be deprived, of their liberty (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, p. 22, \u00a7 40), save in accordance with the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of Article 5. The list of exceptions set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, p. 848, \u00a7 42; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2000-IV; and Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2004\u2011II).\n27. The Court reiterates that the expressions \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refer back to national law and enshrine the obligation to conform to substantive and procedural rules thereof. Although it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should review whether this law has been complied with (see, among many other authorities, Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996\u2011III, p. 753, \u00a7 41, and Assanidze v. Georgia, cited above, \u00a7 171).\n28. However, the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary but not always the decisive element. The Court must in addition be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. The Court must moreover ascertain whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 45, and Baranowski v. Poland, no. 28358/95, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2000\u2011III).\n29. On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Steel and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2735, \u00a7 54).\n30. In the instant case, the applicant was serving a prison sentence and became eligible for conditional release on 6 January 1999. On 22 March 2000 the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court gave a decision granting the applicant conditional release for a three-year probationary period. That decision was upheld by the Cracow Court of Appeal on 12 April 2000. In the applicant's account, which was not contested by the Government, the Court of Appeal's decision was delivered on 12 April at 9 a.m.\n31. As regards the characteristics of conditional release under Polish law as it stood at the material time, the Court notes that the applicant had had a right to apply for conditional release after having served the statutory minimum term of his prison sentence. It is true that the granting of conditional release is left to the court's discretion. However, once conditional release had been granted, the applicant had the right to be released without delay, as provided for in the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 and on completion of the necessary formalities.\n32. The Government argued that, despite the Court of Appeal's final decision of 12 April 2000, the applicant's continued detention until his release on 14 April 2000 remained justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) as constituting \u201cthe lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court\u201d. The Court does not accept that proposition. It is true that the Convention does not guarantee a right to have a penalty imposed by a court in criminal proceedings suspended for a probationary period (see X v. Switzerland, no. 7648/76, Commission decision of 6 December 1977, Decisions and Reports 11, p. 190). However, in so far as the domestic law provided for such a right and once the conditional release had been granted, the applicant had a right to be released. Consequently, his continued detention following the final decision on his conditional release cannot be considered \u201clawful\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a). That finding is not affected by the possibility of a revocation of conditional release in cases where a person has failed to comply with the relevant conditions or committed a new offence, provided that there is a sufficient connection between his conviction and a recall to prison (see Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, \u00a7 81, ECHR 2002\u2011IV).\n33. The Government next argued that the applicant had been released as soon as the decision on his conditional release was served on the governor of Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison. The applicant's release had been effected in accordance with the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998, under which the release of a convicted person depended on the receipt of a certified copy of the enforceable decision granting him or her conditional release.\n34. In this connection the Court observes that although the applicant's continued detention, following the final decision of the Court of Appeal on his conditional release, ceased to be justified, he could not have expected to be released immediately. The Court reiterates that some delay in implementing a decision to release a detainee is understandable and often inevitable in view of practical considerations relating to the running of the courts and the observance of particular formalities. However, the national authorities must attempt to keep it to a minimum (Quinn v. France, judgment of 22 March 1995, Series A no. 311, p. 17, \u00a7 42; Giulia Manzoni v. Italy, judgment of 1 July 1997, Reports 1997\u2011IV, p. 1191, \u00a7 25 in fine; K.\u2011F. v. Germany, judgment of 27 November 1997, Reports 1997\u2011VII, p. 2675, \u00a7 71; and Mancini v. Italy, no. 44955/98, \u00a7 24, ECHR 2001\u2011IX). The Court reiterates that administrative formalities connected with release cannot justify a delay of more than several hours (Labita, cited above, and Nikolov v. Bulgaria, no. 38884/97, \u00a7 82, 30 January 2003).\n35. The Court notes that the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 invoked by the Government sets out in paragraph 3 a general principle that all administrative formalities had to be carried out without delay, in particular those concerning transmission of information and official notifications and related to the release of a detainee (see relevant domestic law). It further observes that the Court of Appeal dispatched a certified copy of its decision on 12 April 2000. That copy was received by the Tarn\u00f3w Regional Court on 13 April 2000. On the same day the Regional Court transmitted the decision to the prison and directed the applicant's release. Those documents were received by the prison administration on 14 April 2000. The Court observes that the Government have not explained what means were used for the dispatch of the relevant decision and whether the dispatch was effected without delay. Moreover, the Government did not present a detailed account of the relevant events, from the time of the delivery of the decision by the Court of Appeal until the precise moment of the applicant's release. In this connection, the Court reiterates that it must scrutinise complaints of delays in the release of detainees with particular vigilance (Nikolov, cited above, \u00a7 80). According to the applicant, the Court of Appeal's decision was given on 12 April 2000 at 9 a.m. and he was released only on 14 April 2000 at 4 p.m. Consequently, the delay between the delivery of the Court of Appeal's decision and the applicant's release exceeded 48 hours. In the Court's view the administrative formalities related to the applicant's release could and should have been carried out more swiftly. In this regard, the Court observes that the paramount importance of the right to liberty imposes on the authorities a duty to do away with organisational shortcomings attributable to the State which may occasion unjustified deprivation of liberty.\n36. As regards the Government's submission related to the possibility of bringing an action in tort against the State Treasury, the Court first observes that the Government did not raise that argument in their preliminary objections. Neither did they provide any relevant examples from the practice of the domestic courts. In any event, the Court observes that the relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 417 et seq.), as applicable before 1 September 2004, provided for a restrictive regime as regards the State's tortious liability. That regime was significantly altered only from 1 September 2004, following the entry into force of the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes. The relevant amendments were aimed in essence at enlarging the scope of the State's liability in tort. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court does not accept the Government's assertion.\n37. In conclusion, the Court considers that it cannot be said that the relevant authorities attempted to keep to a minimum the delay in implementing the decision to release the applicant as required by the relevant case-law. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. The applicant further complained that the delay in his release from prison had given rise to a violation of his right to respect for his private and family life in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.\n39. However, the Court notes that the principal issue in the present case concerns the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that no substantiated separate issue arises in respect of Article 8.\nIt follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n41. The applicant claimed 10,000 Polish zlotys in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the delay in releasing him from prison.\n42. The Government contested the amount claimed as exorbitant. They proposed that if the Court were to find a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1, it should award the applicant EUR 1,000.\n43. The Court notes that it has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 on account of the delay in the applicant's release following the final decision on his conditional release. It considers that this delay must have caused the applicant frustration and anxiety. Having regard to the foregoing and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,500 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n44. The applicant submitted no claim in respect of costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n45. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the delay in releasing the applicant admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 6 March 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 July and 4 November 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Home Office Guidelines\n13. At the relevant time, the Home Office Guidelines of 1984 on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines were available in the library of the House of Commons and were disclosed by the Home Office on application.\n14. In each case, the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met: (a) the investigation concerned serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation had been tried and failed, or had been, from the nature of things, unlikely to succeed if tried; c) there must have been good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism and d) the use of equipment was operationally feasible.\n#### B. The Police Act 1997\n15. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, entered into force on 22 February 1998.\n16. Since 25 September 2000, these controls have been augmented by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (\u201cRIPA\u201d). In particular, covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections 26(3) and 48(1) of RIPA. RIPA also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant invoked Article 8 of the Convention in respect of the use of a covert surveillance device by the police to record conversations in his home. Article 8 provides insofar as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n18. The Government conceded, in the light of Khan v. the United Kingdom (no. 35394/97, ECHR 2000-V, \u00a7\u00a7 26-28), that the installation of a recording device in the applicant's home by the police amounted to an interference with the applicant's right to private life guaranteed by Article 8 and that these measures were not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d for the purposes of Article 8 \u00a7 2.\n19. The Court recalls, as in the above-mentioned Khan case, that at the relevant time there existed no statutory system to regulate the use of covert recording devices by the police. The interference disclosed by the measures implemented in respect of the applicant were therefore not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d as required by the second paragraph of Article 8 and there has accordingly been a violation of Article 8.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant also contended there was no remedy available to him at national level in respect of his Article 8 complaint, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [this] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n21. The Government accepting that the applicant did not enjoy an effective remedy in domestic law at the relevant time in respect of the violation of his right to private life under Article 8, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 13 in this regard.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n23. The applicant failed, without explanation or request for an extension, to submit his claims under Article 41 of the Convention within the time-limit set for that purpose. The Court further notes that the claims submitted more than one month after the expiry of the time-limit were incomplete. In the circumstances, it makes no award under this provision (see e.g. Boca v. Belgium, no. 50615/99, 15 November 1999, \u00a7 31).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n2.

Gotchev,\nand also of Mr M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 October 1993 and 21 February 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Penal Code\n18. Pursuant to Article 1 in Chapter 1 of the Penal Code (brottsbalken):\n\u201cA crime (brott) is constituted by any act for which the present code or other Law or Statute provides punishment (straff) as stated below.\u201c\nAccording to Article 3, a reaction to crime (p\u00e5f\u00f6ljd f\u00f6r brott) is understood in the code to mean the ordinary forms of punishment, notably fines and imprisonment.\n#### B. Offences against the good order of court proceedings\n19. Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, as applicable at the material time, read:\n\u201cA person who, at a court sitting, disturbs the proceedings or takes photographs in the courtroom, or fails to comply with directions or prohibitions imposed under Chapter 5, Article 9, shall be ordered to pay a fine. The same punishment (straff) may be imposed on a person who, in his oral or written observations to the court, expresses himself in an improper manner.\u201c\nChapter 5, Article 9, provides inter alia that the presiding judge may order a person who disturbs the proceedings or behaves in an improper manner to leave the courtroom.\n20. Fines imposed under Article 5 could not exceed 1,000 Swedish kronor (Article 9 in Chapter 9, as applicable at the relevant time), unlike ordinary criminal-law fines which were income-based.\n21. The question as to which court has jurisdiction in cases concerning offences against the good order of court proceedings (r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsf\u00f6rseelser) is governed by Article 5 in Chapter 19 - \u201cPart II. On the procedure in criminal cases\u201c (\u201cII. Om r\u00e4ttegangen i brottm\u00e5l\u201c) - of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Under this Article it is for the court sitting in the proceedings - whether civil, criminal or other - in which the improper conduct has occurred to examine of its own motion whether it constitutes such an offence.\nArticle 1 in Chapter 20 (Part II of the code) reads:\n\u201cThe court may not examine a question of criminal liability in the absence of a criminal charge. However, it may deal with issues of offences against the good order of court proceedings without a charge being brought.\u201c\nIn the proceedings under consideration, the courts followed the procedure laid down in the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters (lagen om handl\u00e4ggning av domstols\u00e4renden 1946:807 - \u201cthe 1946 Act\u201c). Section 1 provides:\n\u201cThe present Act shall apply to matters relating to the administration of justice with which the ordinary lower courts must deal of their own motion or on application and which, according to statute or other regulation, do not fall to be examined under the procedure provided for in civil or criminal cases; however, it shall not apply to questions of punishment or other consequences of a criminal offence.\u201c\n22. If the court in question finds that a person has contravened Chapter 9, Article 5, it may immediately order him to pay a fine. Such a measure is not entered in the police register.\n#### C. Oral hearing in proceedings relating to offences against the good order of court proceedings\n23. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 4 of the 1946 Act, a hearing may be held if the court in question considers that the person concerned should be heard orally. Should the court decide to hold one, it is, pursuant to section 5 of the 1946 Act, governed by the same provisions as apply to hearings in civil cases.\n#### D. Conversion of fines\n24. A fine imposed under Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure may, subject to the conditions laid down in the 1979 Act on the Enforcement of Fines (b\u00f6tesverkst\u00e4llighetslagen 1979:189 - \u201cthe 1979 Act\u201c), as amended in 1983 (Lag 1983: 352), be converted into a prison sentence.\nAccording to sections 15 and 16 of the 1979 Act, the District Court must, upon the request of the public prosecutor, convert - by way of a decision (beslut) - uncollected fines into a term of imprisonment if it is obvious that the person concerned has intentionally failed to pay them or if there are other special reasons in the public interest for so converting them. A term of imprisonment imposed on this ground should be not less than fourteen days and not more than three months.\nIn proceedings concerning a request for the conversion of a fine into a prison sentence, the District Court must summon the prosecution and the defendant to appear at a hearing (section 17).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n25. In his application (no. 14220/88) to the Commission of 2 July 1988, Mr Ravnsborg complained, firstly, that in the proceedings relating to the fines he had, in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, been refused an oral hearing and had not even had an opportunity to refute the charges against him. Secondly, he maintained that there was a further breach of this Article (art. 6) in that the Court of Appeal had refused to hold a public hearing before deciding on the issue of the appointment of an administrator. In addition, he alleged that the imposition of fines constituted a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (right to freedom of expression) of the Convention and of Article 1 (right of property) of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. Finally, he invoked Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, maintaining that the measures were based on provisions which were invalid.\n26. On 10 October 1990 the Commission declared the second complaint inadmissible. On 9 January 1992 it found the first complaint admissible, but declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 10 December 1992 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by eleven votes to seven, that Article 6 (art. 6) being inapplicable, there had been no violation of this Article (art. 6). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. SCOPE OF THE CASE\n27. Before the Court, the applicant reiterated a number of allegations which the Commission had declared inadmissible in its decision of 9 January 1992. He argued that the latter decision was flawed on the ground that the independence and impartiality of one of the Commission members taking part in its adoption were open to doubt.\nHowever, the Court, in accordance with its established case-law (see, for instance, the Helmers v. Sweden judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p.13, para. 25), will deal only with the complaint declared admissible by the Commission, namely that the absence of an oral hearing in any of the proceedings relating to the fines violated Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.\nIn this connection it is not alleged that the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201c were at issue. The only question is whether the proceedings related to a \u201ccriminal charge\u201c against him within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)\n28. Paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1), in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\n29. According to the applicant fines constituted one of the basic forms of criminal punishment under Swedish law (see paragraph 18 above) and should - without exception - be administered in a manner fulfilling the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6).\nThe Government contested the applicability of this Article (art. 6) to the proceedings in issue; in their view, these were not \u201ccriminal\u201c but disciplinary in character. The Commission agreed.\nIn any event, the Government disputed that the absence of hearings gave rise to any breach of Article 6 (art. 6).\n30. In order to determine whether Article 6 (art. 6) was applicable under its \u201ccriminal\u201c head, the Court will have regard to the three alternative criteria laid down in its case-law (see, for example, the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, p. 35, para. 82; the Lutz v. Germany judgment of 25 August 1987, Series A no. 123, p. 23, para. 55; the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, pp. 17-18, paras. 31-34; the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, pp. 15-17, paras. 30-35).\n#### A. Legal classification of the offence under Swedish law\n31. It must first be ascertained whether the provisions defining the offence in issue belong, according to the domestic legal system, to criminal law.\n32. The applicant maintained mainly that offences punishable by a fine were per se criminal, pursuant to the Penal Code, and that Article 5 in Chapter 9 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, which itself referred to fines as \u201cpunishment\u201c (\u201cstraff\u201c; see paragraphs 18-19 above), clearly fell within the criminal sphere. The Government and the Commission had mistakenly inferred from the preparatory work to this Article (Nytt juridisk arkiv II 1943, p.91) that the rule therein should be distinguished from the criminal law; this merely provided a description of the overlap between Article 5 and the relevant rules of the \u201cPenal Code\u201c(\u201callm\u00e4nna strafflagen\u201c)in force at the material time. The correct distinction was that between the general criminal law, embodied in the Penal Code, and the special criminal law, found in other statutes; Article 5 belonged to the latter category. He also pointed to certain commentaries by legal authors describing Article 5 offences as being of a criminal character. Moreover, the statutory provision governing which court had jurisdiction in such matters and laying down that these may be examined without there being any prosecution were to be found in \u201cPart II\u201c of the Code of Judicial Procedure, entitled \u201cOn the procedure in criminal cases\u201c (see paragraph 21 above). In his submission, the applicable procedure was but a slightly modified version of the ordinary criminal procedure, though the national courts in the case had by error followed the rules in the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters which did not apply to questions of punishment (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant in addition placed emphasis on the possibility of converting fines imposed under Article 5 into a term of imprisonment (see paragraph 24 above). Consequently, in his view, Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was applicable to the criminal proceedings in which he was fined.\n33. The Court notes that some of the factors relied on by the applicant might be taken as indicative of a criminal classification under Swedish law.\nOn the other hand, there are also a number of factors going the other way. As the Government and the Commission pointed out, when such conduct as described in Article 5 occurs, it is for the court sitting in the particular case to examine of its own motion and without the involvement of the public prosecutor whether there has been an offence under that Article (see paragraph 21 above). Moreover, the said Article 5 deals only with offences against the good order of court proceedings, whilst improper behaviour of a more serious character may be considered a criminal offence under the relevant rules of the Penal Code. The proceedings relating to the fines imposed on the applicant were based on the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters (see paragraph 21 above); although the applicability of this Act is contested by the applicant, the Court cannot in this regard substitute its own views for those of the Swedish courts (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van der Leer v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 170-A, p. 12, para. 22; and the Margareta and Roger Andersson v. Sweden judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A no. 226-A, pp. 27-28, para. 82). Furthermore, unlike fines under the ordinary criminal law, the fines imposed under Article 5 were not income-based (see paragraph 20 above). Although this is not decisive, since in many criminal systems fines are not necessarily based on earnings, it is an indication that under Swedish law the fines in question are not viewed as an ordinary criminal-law sanction. Finally, in contrast to such sanction, the fines at issue were not entered on the police register.\nAs appears from the above, the formal classification under Swedish law is open to differing interpretations; on the evidence adduced, the Court cannot find it established that the provisions concerning sanctions against disturbance of the good order of court proceedings belong to criminal law under the domestic legal system.\n#### B. The nature of the offence\n34. It is therefore necessary to turn to the second criterion, namely the very nature of the offence.\nThe Court notes that Chapter 9, Article 5, second sentence, of the Code of Judicial Procedure applies to improper statements made orally or in writing to a court by a person attending or taking part in the proceedings, but not to such statements made in a different context or by a person falling outside the circle of people covered by that provision (see paragraph 19 above). It is for the court sitting in the particular proceedings in which the misconduct has occurred to examine, of its own accord, whether the misconduct falls foul of Article 5 (see paragraph 21 above).\nIn this respect the situation is different from those at issue in the cases of Weber and Demicoli, where the Court found Article 6 (art. 6) to be applicable (see the above-mentioned Weber judgment, p. 18, para. 33; and the above-mentioned Demicoli judgment, p. 17, para. 33). Rules enabling a court to sanction disorderly conduct in proceedings before it are a common feature of legal systems of the Contracting States. Such rules and sanctions derive from the indispensable power of a court to ensure the proper and orderly functioning of its own proceedings. Measures ordered by courts under such rules are more akin to the exercise of disciplinary powers than to the imposition of a punishment for commission of a criminal offence. It is, of course, open to States to bring what are considered to be more serious examples of disorderly conduct within the sphere of criminal law, but that has not been shown to be the case in the present instance as regards the fines imposed upon the applicant (see paragraph 33 above).\nFor these reasons the Court reaches the conclusion that the kind of proscribed conduct for which the applicant was fined in principle falls outside the ambit of Article 6 (art. 6). The courts may need to respond to such conduct even if it is neither necessary nor practicable to bring a criminal charge against the person concerned.\n#### C. The nature and degree of severity of the penalty\n35. Notwithstanding the non-criminal character of the proscribed misconduct, the nature and degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risked incurring - the third criterion - may bring the matter into the \u201ccriminal\u201c sphere. A fine imposed under Article 5 in Chapter 9 could amount to 1,000 kronor and actually did so in all three instances in the present case. Moreover, the fine was convertible under Swedish law into a term of imprisonment (see paragraphs 20 and 24 above).\nHowever, in the Court\u2019s view, the possible amount of each fine did not attain a level such as to make it a \u201ccriminal\u201c sanction. Unlike ordinary fines, the kind at issue was not to be entered on the police register (see paragraph 22 above). A decision to convert the fines could only be taken by the District Court in limited circumstances (see paragraph 24 above). What is more, it would then have been necessary to summon the applicant to appear before the District Court for an oral hearing in separate proceedings.\nAccordingly, the Court shares the opinion of the Government and the Commission that what was at stake for the applicant was not sufficiently important to warrant classifying the offences as \u201ccriminal\u201c.\n#### D. Conclusion\n36. In sum, Article 6 (art. 6) did not apply to the matters complained of and has therefore not been violated in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that the case is limited to the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning the absence of an oral hearing in any of the proceedings relating to the fines imposed upon him;\n2. Holds that Article 6 (art. 6) did not apply to those proceedings and has not therefore been violated.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 March 1994.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 EISSEN\nRegistrar", "001-68512": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u015e\u0130R\u0130N v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 February 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n14. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained in the first place that he had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court. The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicant was complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court, he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 15 October 1997.\n17. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six-month rule in the past and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003, and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n18. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n19. In the light of its established case law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court\n20. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts. Finally, they stated that the State Security Courts had been abolished as of 2004.\n21. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36).\n22. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for being a member of an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fear as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n23. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. As to the remainder of the complaints submitted under Article 6\n24. The Government submitted that the written opinion of the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation generally took the form of a one-page document, which only contained practical information concerning the case and briefly stated whether the judgment of the first-instance court should be upheld or quashed. They also referred to the legislative amendment of 2003, which regulated the ex officio notification of the written opinion of the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation.\n25. Having regard to its finding that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45 and Durmaz and Others v. Turkey, nos. 46506/99, 46569/99, 46570/99 and 46939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 14 October 2004).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n27. The Court points out that under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted in writing together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, \u201cfailing which the Chamber may reject the claim in whole or in part\u201d.\n28. In the instant case, on 27 September 2004 the Court invited the applicant to submit his claims for just satisfaction. Upon his request, the Court granted an extension of time until 29 November 2004 and the applicant was informed that no further extension would be granted to him after that date. However, he did not submit any such claims within the specified time\u2011limit.\n29. In view of the above, the Court makes no award under Article 41 of the Convention (see Ormanc\u0131 and Others v. Turkey, no. 43647/98, \u00a7\u00a7 48-51, 21 December 2004, and Pravednaya v. Russia, no. 69529/01, \u00a7\u00a7 43-46, 18 November 2004).\n30. Even though the applicant submits no claims for just satisfaction, where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted by a tribunal which is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant is granted in due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint relating to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court;\n3.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n12. The Government argued in the first place that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months time-limit. In their view, the six months period should start running from 9 October 2001, the date on which the applicant's police statement was taken. As regards the merits, the Government submitted that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer during his questioning before the investigating judge on 12 October 2001 and thereafter during the subsequent criminal proceedings.\n13. The Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months following the final decision of the Court of Cassation that had been delivered on 10 October 2003, in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Consequently, the Government's objection cannot be upheld.\n14. The Court further notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n15. The Court observes that the applicant's right of access to a lawyer was restricted during his police custody pursuant to Section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, he did not have access to a lawyer during his interrogation by the police and the public prosecutor. Moreover, the Court observes that during his police interrogation, the applicant accepted the charges against him and this statement was subsequently used for his conviction by the trial court. The Court takes note of the fact that the applicant had legal representation during his questioning by the investigating judge. However, in the present case, the applicant was undoubtedly affected by the absence of a lawyer when his statement had been taken by the police as, although the applicant repeatedly denied his police statement, the State Security Court used this statement as the main evidence. The Court further finds it significant that the police statement of N.S., although retracted subsequently during the trial, was also used to confirm the applicant's police statement.\n16. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that neither the assistance provided by a lawyer during the interrogation by the investigating judge, nor the adversarial nature of the subsequent criminal proceedings could cure the defects which occurred during the applicant's questioning by the police.\n17. The Court therefore concludes that, even though the applicant had the opportunity of being represented by a lawyer during his interrogation by the investigating judge, the absence of a lawyer during his police interrogation irretrievably affected his defence rights as his police statement was used for his conviction (Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a756-62), 27 November 2008).\n18. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n19. Relying on Article 5 of the Convention, the applicant alleged that his family was not informed of his arrest, that he had not been informed about the reasons of his arrest, that he had not been able to challenge the lawfulness of his police custody and that he had been held in police custody for a long time. The applicant further invoked Article 13 of the Convention and stated that Law no. 466 pertaining to the payment of compensation to persons unlawfully arrested or detained was not an effective remedy for his Article 5 complaints.\n20. The Court finds nothing whatsoever in the case file which might disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly-ill founded and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant requested 5,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary compensation. He further claimed EUR 1,000 for costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and EUR 3,800 for legal fees, solely referring to the Izmir Bar Association's scale of fees. The Government contested the claims.\n22. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, ruling on an equitable basis, it awards EUR 1,000 to the applicant.\n23. The Court further considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the re-trial of the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should the applicant so request (see, Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 72).\n24. As regards costs and expenses, aAccording to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the applicant has not established that he actually incurred the costs claimed. Accordingly, the Court makes no award under this head.\n25. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant during his police custody admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, on account of the lack of legal assistance to the applicant when he was in police custody;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 13 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-68178": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF MILLER v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 January 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Disability benefits\n12. According to Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act (as in force until 1 January 2001, when the 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance - lagen (1998:703) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force), a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1997 the basic amount was SEK 36,300. In 1983, when the applicant turned 65, it was SEK 19,400.\n13. According to Chapter 9, section 3 of the 1962 Act (as in force at the material time), such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount, depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability.\n#### B. Procedure\n14. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act could form the subject of an appeal to the County Administrative Court, to the Administrative Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n15. The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings shall be in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing (I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas, om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det)\u201d.\nUnder those circumstances it was not possible for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n16. From the case-law of the national courts, it appears that the grounds stated in the third paragraph of section 9 for refusing an oral hearing have been interpreted as being alternative rather than cumulative (see Regeringsr\u00e4ttens \u00c5rsbok 1997 ref 62).\n17. According to the preparatory work to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing could be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and could benefit the examination of a case, in particular in two situations: firstly, when it was necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it was difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case needed to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a supplement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\nIt was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party's request for an oral hearing should be given close consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing was necessary was to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. However, other circumstances could be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party's understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case was of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the value of what was at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing in his case, including the fact that he was denied an opportunity to have witnesses called to give evidence on his behalf, constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, he complained under this provision that the competent courts had failed to carry out an examination of the merits of his Article 6 \u00a7 1 complaint. In so far as is relevant this provision reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government disputed the above complaints and invited the Court to declare them inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. In any event, they submitted, there had been no violation of the Convention in this case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. In so far as the applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court considers that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n21. In so far as the applicant alleges a further violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the alleged failure of the national courts to deal with his above complaint about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court notes that his allegation is not actually borne out by the facts. His claim that the County Administrative Court's refusal to hold an oral hearing had violated Article 6 \u00a7 1 was first entertained by the Administrative Court of Appeal, when refusing to hold a hearing and to grant him leave to appeal. Subsequently, the Supreme Administrative Court did consider the matter, as is evident from the information given to him on that occasion. This complaint must therefore be declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Merits of the complaint about the lack of an oral hearing\n##### 1. The applicant's submissions\n22. The applicant maintained that there were no exceptional reasons capable of justifying the refusal to grant him an oral hearing. His appeal against the Social Insurance Office's decision had raised both issues of fact and of law. These could not be determined solely on the basis of the medical records and opinions, since his claim for disability benefits was based not solely on his reduced functional capacity but also on his need for assistance and on the extra costs he had incurred. At an oral hearing the applicant would have been able to supplement the evidence by explaining his medical condition and its consequences in his daily life before he had reached the age of 65. Moreover, it would have enabled the national courts to put supplementary questions on these aspects to the applicant and to the witnesses he had requested be heard.\n##### 2. The Government's submissions\n23. The Government were of the view that there were exceptional circumstances in this particular case that justified dispensing with an oral hearing. As could be seen from the County Administrative Court's reasoning in its decision of 15 January 1998, it had decided the issue in accordance with domestic law, in the light of the subject-matter to be determined by it and having regard to all the written material that was already available in the case. The main issue to be determined was whether the applicant's need for assistance and additional costs had reached the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. However, one prominent feature was that the assessment as to whether the applicant was entitled to a disability allowance had to be made in relation to a particular point in time in the past, namely when he had retired at the age of 65. That was in 1983, 13 years before the matter was brought before the courts. This fact alone indicated that the relevant basis for the assessment was the written material from that time.\n24. Although one could infer from the applicant's request to the County Administrative Court for an oral hearing that he wished to have witnesses called, it should be noted that he did not give any particular reasons, nor indicate the subject of the witness evidence or what he sought to demonstrate.\n25. From the rather lengthy reasons that the County Administrative Court gave for its refusal to hold an oral hearing, it was evident that it regarded the written evidence on the applicant's condition at the relevant time as sufficient; there were no unclear points as far as the basis for the medical assessment was concerned. The applicant's claim and arguments were also clear. Any remaining uncertainties regarding his additional costs due to his impairment at the age of 65 could be clarified in writing. The principle established in the Court's case-law in the area of criminal proceedings that it was within the domain of the national courts to decide on the admissibility of evidence should also have a bearing in other areas.\n26. None of the oral evidence requested by him before the national courts would have provided any information of relevance to the case in addition to that already available in the written evidence, which included the Social Security Office's case-file.\nHearing the persons who had taken part in the Office's decision would not have supported his case.\nNor would it have served the applicant to have the physician appointed by the Office heard. It was not his task to make an independent assessment of the applicant's state of health at the relevant time. He had no personal knowledge of the applicant and had not been involved in the treatment of his medical condition. Instead, his role had been to act as a medical adviser to the Office and his opinion had been available in the case.\nOral evidence from the applicant's own doctor about his state of health 15 years earlier would have been of limited value. It was highly unlikely that the doctor would have been able to add anything to what he had already noted at the time in the medical records presented in the case. It was clear from the medical opinion issued by the doctor in 1996 for the purpose of the applicant's request for disability benefits that the assessment contained therein - that the applicant was in need of some support and had incurred additional costs - referred to the applicant's situation in 1996. That assessment was irrelevant to the issue whether the applicant would have qualified for disability benefits in 1983. It was hardly likely that the doctor would have been able to recall at an oral hearing the applicant's health status at a particular time in the past; he would have had to rely on the medical records that were already available to the County Administrative Court.\n27. There was no indication that the applicant offered to give evidence himself. Even if he had done so, it should be stressed that none of the judges taking part in the case had or were expected to possess any medical expertise of their own, let alone the ability to make an assessment of their own regarding the applicant's medical status 15 years' earlier by meeting him in person.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n28. It has not been argued, nor is there anything to suggest, that this case relating to the applicant's claim for benefits under the national social security scheme did not concern a dispute (contestation) over a \u201cright\u201d which could be said, on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. In particular, it could not be said that the applicant's claim was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation (see Rolf Gustafsson v. Sweden, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, p. 1160, \u00a7 39 in fine). Nor is it disputed, and the Court is satisfied, that the right in question was \u201ccivil\u201d in character in the autonomous sense of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports, 1996-VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53). This provision is accordingly applicable; the only issue is whether there was a failure to comply with it on account of the refusal to hold an oral hearing in the case.\n29. The Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 entails an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for instance, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201311, \u00a7\u00a7 21\u201322; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20\u201321, \u00a7 44; Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 679\u201380, \u00a7 51; Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2) Reports 1998-I, pp. 168-169, \u00a7 46; Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, \u00a7 34, 12 November 2002; Lundevall v. Sweden, no. 38629/97, \u00a7 34, 12 November 2002; and D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, 12 November 2002, \u00a7 37; G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, ECHR 2002-V, \u00a7\u00a7 47-52).\nThe exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social\u2011security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see the following judgments cited above: Schuler-Zgraggen pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58; Salomonsson, \u00a7 38; Lundevall, \u00a7 38; and D\u00f6ry, \u00a7 41).\n30. The Court further reiterates that, provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court. Regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal system, to the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests are actually presented and protected in the appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file (see for instance Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36).\nThe Court considers that this less strict standard should also apply if an oral hearing has been waived at first instance and requested only on appeal. In the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing be held at first instance rather than only before the appellate court (see the above-mentioned D\u00f6ry judgment).\n31. Turning to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court observes from the outset that there can be no question of the applicant having waived any right to a hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (cf, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7\u00a7 64 and 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58). The applicant had already expressly requested an oral hearing at what, in the Court's view, was the most appropriate stage of the proceedings - at first instance before the County Administrative Court. On this account alone the present case is more striking than those of the aforementioned Salomonsson and Lundevall judgments, where an oral hearing was not requested until the appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal and where the Court nevertheless found a violation.\nThe applicant also made a request for an oral hearing to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Since both the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court refused him leave to appeal, the County Administrative Court in fact became the first and only instance to examine the merits of his case. Therefore the only issue to be determined is whether the first instance court's refusal to hold an oral hearing was justified by exceptional circumstances.\n32. In this regard the Court notes, by way of general observation, that proceedings before the Swedish administrative courts were in principle in writing. Pursuant to section 9 of the 1971 Administrative Court Procedure Act, before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court, an oral hearing should be held if so requested by a party and if the competent court found that a hearing would neither be unnecessary nor dispensable for other particular reasons. According to the interpretation made by the Swedish courts, these two grounds for refusing a request to hold an oral hearing were alternative, not cumulative. Thus, in administrative-law cases heard on the merits by one level of jurisdiction only, there is an apparent discrepancy between the Convention case-law, according to which an oral hearing must be held unless there are exceptional reasons, and the lesser standard applied by the national court. The Court considers that the respondent State should take appropriate measures to ensure that it is the Convention standard that applies.\n33. It should also be emphasised that the County Administrative Court had full jurisdiction to examine the issue raised in the applicant's appeal, namely whether he fulfilled the conditions for obtaining disability benefits under Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act. According to this provision it was a condition that, before reaching the age of 65, he must have been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. A person's eligibility for disability benefits was to be determined in the light of his or her \u201ctotal need of support and assistance\u201d, making it \u201cnecessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses\u201d.\n34. In addition, the medical certificates on which the applicant relied supported rather than contradicted his claim that he did fulfil the above conditions for disability pension, though did not conclusively deal with the issue. When the matter was before the Social Security Office, one member reserved his position and was in favour of remitting the case for further investigation of the applicant's need for assistance. The County Administrative Court, for its part, when refusing to hold an oral hearing, noted an uncertainty as to his extra costs due to disability but considered that this could be clarified, albeit in writing. When later determining the merits of the case, in the light of all the evidence, it conceded that before the age of 65 the applicant had for a considerable time been functionally impaired. But the County Administrative Court rejected his claim, finding that the degree of his disability did not reach the minimum required.\nTherefore, in the Court's view, the question of the degree of disability was apparently not straightforward. For example, the Court is unable to accept the Government's argument that, because of the passage of time, oral evidence from the applicant's personal doctor was unlikely to add anything useful. On the contrary, it is not inconceivable that the doctor could have fleshed out at an oral hearing the various observations he had made in the relevant medical records, and could have given his opinion on their implications for the issues raised before the County Administrative Court.\nNor does it seem, either from the arguments and evidence submitted to the County Administrative Court or the latter's reasoning, that the issue of extra costs was clear-cut. For instance, it is not immediately apparent why the figures adduced (totalling SEK 18,100) did not reach the requisite minimum 28.5% of the basic amount (which in 1997 was SEK 36,300 and in 1983 was SEK 19,400).\nThe Court considers that the issues raised by the applicant's judicial appeal were not only technical in nature. In its view, the administration of justice would have been better served in the applicant's case by affording him a right to explain, on his own behalf or through his representative, his personal situation, taken as a whole at the relevant time, in a hearing before the County Administrative Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-cited G\u00f6\u00e7 judgment, \u00a7 51).\n35. In these circumstances it could hardly be said that the applicant's claim was incapable of giving rise to any issue of fact or of law which was of such a nature as to require an oral hearing for the determination of the case.\n36. Finally, as regards the Government's submission that the applicant failed to give reasons for his request for an oral hearing, the Court observes that the applicant was not expressly invited by the County Administrative Court to explain his wish for an oral hearing. After the latter's refusal to hold an oral hearing the applicant stated that he considered that his medical certificates needed to be clarified and that oral evidence from his own doctor would be important for establishing the degree of his disability. Therefore the competent national court had sufficient elements to be in a position to consider the matter.\n37. Against this background it cannot be said that the question whether the applicant, before the age of 65, fulfilled the legal conditions for the grant of a disability pension, was of such a nature as to dispense the County Administrative Court from the normal obligation to hold an oral hearing. Accordingly, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n39. The applicant claimed SEK 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n40. The Government were of the view that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute adequate just satisfaction. However, if the Court were to find that an award should be made under this heading, the Government would find the amount claimed acceptable.\n41. The Court, making an assessment on an equitable basis, awards the applicant EUR 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n42. The applicant requested the reimbursement of the legal fees incurred, as follows:\n###### (a) SEK 20,000 for the work (16 hours at the rate of SEK 1,000 per hour plus 20% Value Added Tax (V.A.T.)) by his legal representative, Mr G. Antal, in the domestic proceedings;\n###### (b) SEK 7,500 for the work (6 hours at the same rate) by the above lawyer in the Strasbourg proceedings until July 1999;\n###### (c) SEK 78,750 for the work (42 hours at 1,500 SEK per hour, plus 20% V.A.T.) by Mr U. Jacobson, who took over as his legal representative in August 1999.\n43. The Government did not object to the hourly rate but considered the number of hours claimed excessive. In the domestic proceedings, only costs referable to the oral hearing issue should be reimbursed and should not be reimbursed beyond SEK 4,000. In so far as costs before the Court were concerned, the Government considered 3 hours' work by Mr Antal and 17 hours work by Mr Jacobson to be reasonable. Thus, an award of SEK 28,500, V.A.T. included, would be reasonable in their view.\n44. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred in order to prevent or obtain redress for the violation found and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000 in respect of items (a) and (b) and EUR 3,500 in respect of item (c) (both amounts being inclusive of V.A.T.).\n#### C. Default interest\n45. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Declares unanimously the complaint concerning the lack of an oral hearing admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds by four votes to three that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the refusal to hold an oral hearing;\n##### 3. Holds by four votes to three\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts:\n(i) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 8 February 2005, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS. Doll\u00e9 J.-P. Costa\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the concurring opinion of Mr Costa and the dissenting opinions of Mr Baka, joined by Mr Jungwiert, and Mr T\u00fcrmen are annexed to this judgment.\nS.D.\n#### J.-P. C.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE COSTA\n(Translation)\nAlbeit grudgingly, I have voted in favour of the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 by Sweden.\nMy natural tendency would have been to consider that the absence of a hearing in this case was justified by the nature of the issues of fact and law that were to be determined. In my opinion, it was possible to rule that the issues were technical in nature and could be satisfactorily settled solely on the basis of the file. The case is close to that of Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland (judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263), which also concerned a disability pension. Admittedly, Mr Miller wished to have doctors and those employees of the Social Insurance Office who had participated in the contested decision called as witnesses. Normally, however, examination of the medical certificates included in the case file would have been enough to compensate for the non-appearance of such witnesses. Social security is a technical area, and has nothing in common with, for example, criminal matters, where the oral character of deliberations and the hearing of witnesses are of great importance.\nTwo elements, however, have prompted me to join the majority. In the first place, there has been a certain judicial obduracy against the applicant's position. In turn, the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's request for a hearing to rule on whether he was to be granted leave to appeal and on the merits, and they subsequently also refused to grant such leave. Thus, Mr Miller's case was examined by only one level of jurisdiction, without an oral hearing. That in itself is not decisive, but it is a factor to be taken into account.\nAbove all, however, the Grand Chamber judgment in G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey (no. 36590/97, ECHR 2002\u2011V) shows that the Court's position has become more stringent. More than in the past, the Court seems to require that an individual must be able to present his or her personal circumstances orally before the courts. Although I was one of the eight judges who expressed a dissenting opinion in this connection in the G\u00f6c judgment, I feel bound to comply with the Court's previous finding.\nNonetheless, I should like to see the Court take a more flexible approach in the future. Written proceedings (which the Court itself generally uses) are frequently reconcilable with the proper administration of justice; they do not always result in unfair proceedings.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE BAKA\nJOINED BY JUDGE JUNGWIERT\n(Translation)\nI disagree with the majority of the Court that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case.\nLike the majority, I also think that the right to a public hearing -specially at the first instance level - is an essential safeguard of judicial procedure. Under Article 6 \u00a7 1 and its interpretation in the case-law of the Court there is a general entitlement to an oral hearing unless exceptional circumstances justify dispensing with such a hearing (H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7 64, or more recently, G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey (GC), no. 36590/97, \u00a7\u00a7 47-52 ECHR 2002-V).\nIn a number of judgments the Court has also pointed out that the exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. In other words, the Court has tried to strike the right balance between transparency and important elements of procedural safeguards on one hand, and practical functionality and the everyday reality of the different national courts on the other.\nApplying the above principles to the present case, I am convinced that on the basis of the special circumstances of the present case the County Administrative Court was justified in dispensing with an oral hearing. Not on the ground that the proceedings before the Swedish administrative courts were in principle in writing nor on the ground that disputes concerning benefits under social security schemes are generally technical ones. I took into account however the fact that the applicant's claim, the figures and his medical assessment had already been established and all the relevant documents were available for the County Administrative Court to be able to take a decision.\nThe only open question in the present case was whether the extra costs incurred before the applicant's 65th birthday owing to his illness could be covered by the disability benefit under the relevant Swedish law. I think that in this situation to establish the applicant's degree of disability 13 years before the matter was brought before the courts the requested oral hearing would have had a very limited value. The offered oral evidence from the applicant's doctor about his state of health 15 years earlier - with a very high probability - had to be based on the medical documents available at the time. In my view it was justifiable to dispense with an oral hearing owing to the exceptional circumstances, such as the limited scope of the rather technical case and the significant amount of time which had elapsed since the events.\nI also think that the case is different from the G\u00f6\u00e7 case relied on by the majority. The subject matter of that case was financial compensation for unlawful detention decided by national courts without holding a hearing. That case would have required a careful assessment of the applicant's and his family's personal distress and anxiety during his detention and an evaluation of these personal factors for the determination of his financial compensation. Moreover, I think that even though the Court was divided in the G\u00f6\u00e7 case, in that type of case the need for transparency and public scrutiny justifies public hearings more than in the Miller case, which was much more technical in nature.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE T\u00dcRMEN\nI fully agree with the dissenting opinion of Judge Baka, except for its last paragraph.", "001-114240": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF REDFEARN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 47335/06)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n6 November 2012\nFINAL\n06/02/2013\nThis judgment has become final under Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Redfearn v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nLech Garlicki, President,\nDavid Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson,\nNicolas Bratza,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nGeorge Nicolaou,\nZdravka Kalaydjieva,\nVincent A. De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 October 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Employment Rights Act 1996\n23. Under section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer. By section 98(1), an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section 98(2), which includes \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201csome other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held\u201d.\nSection 98(4) deals with fairness:\n\u201cWhere the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection (1), the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to the reason shown by the employer) \u2013\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer\u2019s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.\u201d\n24. However, paragraph 106 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) Section 94 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than one year ending with the effective date of termination.\u201d\n25. Section 108(3) of the Employment Rights Act provides a wide variety of exceptions from the one-year qualifying period, many of which derive from the United Kingdom\u2019s implementation of European Community legislation in the field of employment. These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave, refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998, or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer. Moreover, applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race, sex or religion are also exempt from the one-year qualifying period.\n#### B. The Race Relations Act 1976\n26. Section 1 (1) (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 states the following:\n\u201cA person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-\n(a) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u201d\nSection 1 A of the Race Relations Act 1976 states:\n\u201c A person also discriminates against another if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection (IB), he applies to that other provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but\n(a) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons;\n(b) which puts that other at that disadvantage, and\n(c) which he cannot show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 10 AND 11 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained of a violation of his rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. He submitted that, in choosing to become a member of the BNP and to stand for election, he was engaging both his right to freedom of expression pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention and his right to freedom of assembly and association pursuant to Article 11 and that his dismissal had disproportionately interfered with his exercise of those rights.\n28. Article 10 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n29. Article 11 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\n2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.\u201d\n30. The Government contested these arguments.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n32. As the Court has noted, the applicant relies on both Article 10 and Article 11 of the Convention. However, the Court considers it more appropriate to examine his complaints under Article 11 of the Convention, but it will do so in the light of Article 10.\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n33. The applicant submitted that for an employee to lose his job for exercising his right to freedom of association struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of that right. Consequently, he contended that the Government had a positive obligation under Article 11 of the Convention to enact legislation which would have afforded him protection from the termination of his employment by Serco on the ground of his involvement with the BNP. However, since he had less than one year\u2019s qualifying service, he was unable to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n34. The applicant submitted that fundamental rights must be effective and available from the first day of employment. While he understood that it might be appropriate to allow an employer a certain time in which to assess the conduct or capability of an employee, he argued that this should not apply in relation to discrimination on protected grounds. In fact, he submitted that freedom of association would be illusory if it could only be exercised after a certain period of service.\n35. The applicant further submitted that even if he had had more than one year\u2019s qualifying service, his employer would have been able to rely on his political involvement as being \u201csome other substantial reason\u201d to justify the termination of his employment.\n(b) The Government\n36. The Government contended that Article 11 did not impose any positive obligation to enact legislation of the kind suggested by the applicant. They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State\u2019s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of the right or freedom concerned (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 44, S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006\u2011I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State\u2019s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected \u201cto have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers\u201d.\n37. In the alternative, the Government contended that if a positive obligation existed, it was satisfied by the provisions of the 1996 Act. The Government submitted that in the United Kingdom, where the qualifying period of one year\u2019s service has been accrued, the 1996 Act would generally afford protection against dismissal on the grounds of political involvement, unless the employer could demonstrate that the involvement related to the capacity of the employee for performing the work in question or constituted \u201csome other substantial reason\u201d for the dismissal (see section 98(2) of the 1996 Act). If an employer was able to identify one of these two criteria, a fact-sensitive balancing exercise would have to be carried out. However, there was nothing to suggest that such a balancing exercise would be incompatible with the qualified rights under Article 11.\n38. Finally, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period which an employee must serve before statutory protection is obtained in relation to dismissal pursued a legitimate aim, namely the creation of greater employment opportunities by encouraging companies to recruit. Indeed, in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith and Another [2000] UKHL 12 the House of Lords held that it was reasonable of the Secretary of State to consider that the risks of unjustified involvement with tribunals in unfair dismissal cases and the cost of such involvement could deter employers from giving more people jobs. Consequently, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period could not be said to fall outside the State\u2019s margin of appreciation.\n(c) The Third Party Intervener: The Equality and Human Rights Commission\n39. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) submitted that even if the applicant had been employed in the public sector, his dismissal would have been justified as it was clear that a State could lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it was necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants (Van der Heijden v. the Netherlands, app. no. 11002/84, 8 March 1985 and Kern v. Germany, app. no. 26870/04, 29 May 2007). The question whether a dismissal would breach Article 11 turned on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, the degree of contact he or she had with the public and whether or not it involved public trust and confidence, whether the employee had direct contact with or provided services to individuals against which the relevant group or party had expressed hostility, the extent of his involvement with the party or group, the effect his continued employment would have on the employer\u2019s reputation, and the employee\u2019s conduct during the period of employment.\n40. In the Commission\u2019s view, a worker\u2019s active membership of a party such as the BNP, if it became public, would impact on the employer\u2019s provision of services regardless of whether or not there were any complaints about the manner in which he did his job. The fact that the applicant was in direct contact with services users, a significant proportion of whom were of an ethnic or religious group towards which the BNP had expressed hostility, would render any interference with his rights under Article 11 proportionate.\n41. Moreover, the Commission submitted that to require disabled Asian adults and Asian parents of disabled children to entrust themselves or their children to an elected BNP official in order to utilise public authority transport services would threaten to breach the rights of those service users. In this regard, the Commission noted that service providers were obliged to comply with the 1976 Act which prohibited race discrimination and racial harassment against employers and service users.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n42. Although the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected, the national authorities may in certain circumstances be obliged to intervene in the relationships between private individuals by taking reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association (see, mutatis mutandis, Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, 21 June 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 32\u201134, Series A no. 139, Gustafsson v. Sweden, 25 April 1996, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011II, and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000).\n43. Therefore, although the matters about which the applicant complained did not involve direct intervention or interference by the State, the United Kingdom\u2019s responsibility will be engaged if these matters resulted from a failure on its part to secure to the applicant under domestic law his right to freedom of association. In other words there is also a positive obligation on the authorities to provide protection against dismissal by private employers where the dismissal is motivated solely by the fact that an employee belongs to a particular political party (or at least to provide the means whereby there can be an independent evaluation of the proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all the circumstances of a given case).\n44. The Court has recognised that in certain circumstances an employer may lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it is deemed necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants (see, for example, Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VI). In view of the nature of the BNP\u2019s policies (see paragraph 9, above), the Court recognises the difficult position that Serco may have found itself in when the applicant\u2019s candidature became public knowledge. In particular, it accepts that even in the absence of specific complaints from service users, the applicant\u2019s membership of the BNP could have impacted upon Serco\u2019s provision of services to Bradford City Council, especially as the majority of service users were vulnerable persons of Asian origin.\n45. However, regard must also be had to the fact that the applicant was a \u201cfirst-class employee\u201d (see paragraph 7, above) and, prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues. Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role. In this regard, the Court considers that the case can readily be distinguished from that of Stedman v. the United Kingdom (cited above), in which the applicant was dismissed because she refused to work the hours required by the post. In particular, the Court is struck by the fact that these complaints, as summarised in paragraph 10, were in respect of prospective problems and not in respect of anything that the applicant had done or had failed to do in the actual exercise of his employment.\n46. Moreover, although the applicant was working in a non-skilled post which did not appear to have required significant training or experience (compare, for example, Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and Pay v. the United Kingdom, no. 32792/05, 16 September 2008), at the date of his dismissal he was fifty-six years old and it is therefore likely that he would have experienced considerable difficulty finding alternative employment.\n47. Consequently, the Court accepts that the consequences of his dismissal were serious and capable of striking at the very substance of his rights under Article 11 of the Convention (S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, ECHR 2006-I and Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 55). The Court must therefore determine whether in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case a fair balance was struck between the competing interests involved, namely the applicant\u2019s Article 11 right and the risk, if any, that his continued employment posed for fellow employees and service users. It is also to be borne in mind that what the Court is called upon to do in this case is not to pass judgment on the policies or aims, obnoxious or otherwise, of the BNP at the relevant time (the BNP is, in any case, not a party to these proceedings), but solely to determine whether the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11 were breached in the particular circumstances of the instant case. In this connection it is also worth bearing in mind that, like the Front National-Nationaal Front in F\u00e9ret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009) the BNP was not an illegal party under domestic law nor were its activities illegal (see, by way of contrast, Hizb Ut-Tahrir and Others v. Germany (dec.) no. 31098/08, 12 June 2012).\n48. The Court has accepted that Contracting States cannot guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association absolutely (Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7 34). In the context of the positive obligation under Article 11, it has held that where sensitive social and political issues are involved in achieving a proper balance between the competing interests and, in particular, in assessing the appropriateness of State intervention, the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in their choice of the means to be employed (Gustafsson v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n49. Therefore, the principal question for the Court to consider is whether, bearing in mind the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State in this area, the measures taken by it could be described as \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d to secure the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 32 \u2013 34, Gustafsson v. Sweden, cited above, \u00a7 45, and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, cited above, \u00a7 38).\n50. In the opinion of the Court, a claim for unfair dismissal under the 1996 Act would be an appropriate domestic remedy for a person dismissed on account of his political beliefs or affiliations. Once such a claim is lodged with the Employment Tribunal, it falls to the employer to demonstrate that there was a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for the dismissal. Following the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, the domestic courts would then have to take full account of Article 11 in deciding whether or not the dismissal was, in all the circumstances of the case, justified.\n51. However, as the applicant had not been employed for the one-year qualifying period at the date of his dismissal, he was unable to benefit from this remedy. He therefore brought a race discrimination claim under the 1976 Act but this claim was rejected by the Court of Appeal, which found that he had not been discriminated against on account of his race. The Court observes that the 1976 Act is concerned only with direct and indirect race discrimination. Although it would not go so far as to state that it amounted to a wholly ineffective remedy \u2013 indeed, it recalls that the applicant\u2019s claim succeeded before the Employment Appeal Tribunal \u2013 the Court considers that the 1976 Act was not primarily intended to cover a situation such as the present one and a liberal interpretation of the relevant provisions was required in order for the domestic courts to find in the applicant\u2019s favour. Consequently, the Court does not consider that the 1976 Act offered the applicant any protection against the interference with his rights under Article 11 of the Convention.\n52. There is therefore no doubt that the applicant suffered a detriment as a consequence of the one-year qualifying period as it deprived him of the only means by which he could effectively have challenged his dismissal at the domestic level on the ground that it breached his fundamental rights. It therefore falls to the Court to consider whether the respondent State, in including the one-year qualifying period in the 1996 Act, could be said to have taken reasonable and appropriate measures to protect the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11.\n53. The Court observes that the one-year qualifying period was included in the 1996 Act because the Government considered that the risks of unjustified involvement with tribunals in unfair dismissal cases and the cost of such involvement could deter employers from giving more people jobs. Thus, the purpose of the one-year qualifying period was to benefit the domestic economy by increasing labour demand. The Court has received no submissions on the length of the qualifying period but it accepts that one year would normally be a sufficient period for an employer to assess the suitability of an employee before he or she became well-established in a post. Consequently, in view of the margin of appreciation afforded to Contracting States in formulating and implementing social and economic policies, the Court considers that it was in principle both reasonable and appropriate for the respondent State to bolster the domestic labour market by preventing new employees from bringing unfair dismissal claims.\n54. However, it observes that in practice the one-year qualifying period did not apply equally to all dismissed employees. Rather, a number of exceptions were created to offer additional protection to employees dismissed on certain prohibited grounds, such as race, sex and religion, but no additional protection was afforded to employees who were dismissed on account of their political opinion or affiliation.\n55. The Court has previously held that political parties are a form of association essential to the proper functioning of democracy (United Communist Party of Turkey and Others v. Turkey, 30 January 1998, \u00a7 25, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-I). In view of the importance of democracy in the Convention system, the Court considers that in the absence of judicial safeguards a legal system which allows dismissal from employment solely on account of the employee\u2019s membership of a political party carries with it the potential for abuse.\n56. Even if the Court were to acknowledge the legitimacy of Serco\u2019s interest in dismissing the applicant from its workforce having regard to the nature of his political beliefs, the policies pursued by the BNP and his public identification with those policies through his election as a councillor, the fact remains that Article 11 is applicable not only to persons or associations whose views are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also those whose views offend, shock or disturb (see, mutatis mutandis, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 24, and Jersild v. Denmark, 23 September 1994, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 298). For the Court, what is decisive in such cases is that the domestic courts or tribunals be allowed to pronounce on whether or not, in the circumstances of a particular case, the interests of the employer should prevail over the Article 11 rights asserted by the employee, regardless of the length of the latter\u2019s period of employment.\n57. Consequently, the Court considers that it was incumbent on the respondent State to take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect employees, including those with less than one year\u2019s service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion or affiliation, either through the creation of a further exception to the one-year qualifying period or through a free\u2011standing claim for unlawful discrimination on grounds of political opinion or affiliation. As the United Kingdom legislation is deficient in this respect, the Court concludes that the facts of the present case give rise to a violation of Article 11 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 9 OF THE CONVENTION\n58. The applicant also alleged that his dismissal gave rise to a breach of Article 9 of the Convention. Article 9 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.\n2. Freedom to manifest one\u2019s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n59. The Court has examined this complaint but finds, in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, that it does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols.\n60. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n61. The applicant further complained that he had been denied access to an effective remedy in respect of his Convention complaints. Article 13 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n62. The Court reiterates its case-law to the effect that Article 13 does not require the law to provide an effective remedy where the alleged violation arises from primary legislation (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 85, Series A no. 98). In any event, the matter raised by the applicant has been adequately addressed in the Court\u2019s response to his Article 11 complaint.\n63. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION READ TOGETHER WITH ARTICLES 10 AND 11\n64. Lastly, the applicant complained that under United Kingdom legislation, compensation for discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, religious belief and age is uncapped, whereas there is a statutory limit for unfair dismissal. Moreover, he complained that there was no qualifying period in respect of such discrimination claims.\n65. Article 14 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n66. The Court does not consider the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 14 to be manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds and must, therefore, be declared admissible. However, having regard to its findings under Article 11 (see paragraphs 42 \u2013 57 above), the Court does not find it necessary to examine whether or not there has also been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention read together with Articles 10 and 11.\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n67. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n68. The applicant did not submit a claim for just satisfaction.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Declares unanimously the complaints concerning Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention alone and in conjunction with Article 14 admissible and the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds by four votes to three that there has been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention;\n3. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine whether there has also been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention read together with Articles 10 and 11.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 6 November 2012, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Lech Garlicki\nDeputy Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Bratza, Hirvel\u00e4 and Nicolaou is annexed to this judgment.\n#### L.G.\n#### F.A.\nJOINT PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION\nOF JUDGES BRATZA, HIRVEL\u00c4 AND NICOLAOU\n1. We regret that we are unable to share the view of the majority that there was a violation of Article 11 of the Convention in the present case. In our view, the United Kingdom was not in breach of its obligations under the Article by reason of any failure to protect the applicant against his dismissal from his employment on grounds of his political opinion.\n2. Despite differing in the result, there is much in the judgment with which we are in agreement.\n(a) As noted in the judgment, the case concerns exclusively the positive obligations of the State to secure through its legal system the rights guaranteed by Article 11. The applicant\u2019s employer, Serco, was a private limited company and the applicant\u2019s dismissal by the company did not involve any direct intervention or interference on the part of the United Kingdom. The Court has accepted that Contracting States cannot guarantee the effective enjoyment of Article 11 rights absolutely. In assessing whether such positive obligations arise and, if so, to what extent, the Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck within the legal system between the competing interests of the individual and the community as a whole. In a case where sensitive social, economic and political issues are involved, in achieving a proper balance between those interest and, in particular, in assessing the appropriateness of State intervention, the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in the choice of means to be employed.\n(b) It is accepted in the judgment that a claim for unfair dismissal under the 1996 Act affords effective protection against the dismissal of a person on account of his political beliefs or affiliations, imposing as it does an obligation on the employer to demonstrate, inter alia, that there was a substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of the employee.\n(c) It is also accepted that a fair balance is not upset by the inclusion in the 1996 Act of a one-year qualifying period, the purpose of which is to create greater employment opportunities by encouraging companies to recruit without the risk of being subjected to unwarranted claims by employees for unfair dismissal during the early months of employment. Like the House of Lords in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment, ex parte Seymour-Smith and another, we consider that it was and is in principle reasonable and appropriate for the State to lay down a qualifying period and that the period set in the United Kingdom cannot be said to fall outside any acceptable margin of appreciation (see, in the context of a complaint under Article 6 of the Convention, Stedman v. the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which a restriction on access to an industrial tribunal for unfair dismissal to employees of two years\u2019 standing was held to pursue a legitimate aim and not to be arbitrary or to impair the very essence of the right of access to a court). The justification for a qualifying period is not in our view affected by the fact that in an individual case there may be no justifiable grounds for the dismissal or that the dismissal may lead to particular financial or other hardship on the part of the employee concerned. It is the balance struck by the legal system as a whole and not the effect of dismissal in any individual case to which regard must be had.\n3. Where we part company with the majority is in the broad assertion in the judgment that, even within the qualifying period, there exists a positive obligation on the authorities under the Convention \u201cto provide protection against dismissal by private employers where the dismissal is motivated solely by the fact that an employer belongs to a particular political party (or at least to provide the means whereby there can be an independent evaluation of the proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all the circumstances of a given case)\u201d (paragraph 43). In this regard reliance is placed by the majority on the fact that in the United Kingdom the qualifying period is not absolute, certain exceptions having been created in the case, inter alia, of claims by an employee that he has been dismissed on grounds of race, sex or religion but that no exception has been made in the case of a claim of dismissal on grounds of political opinion. It is argued that it is incumbent on the United Kingdom to protect employees, including those with less than one year\u2019s service, from dismissal on grounds of political opinion, either through the creation of a further exception to the one-year qualifying period or through the creation of a free-standing claim for unlawful discrimination on grounds of political opinion.\n4. We are unable to accept the argument that, having created certain exceptions to the requirement of employment for the qualifying period, the State was obliged to create a further exception in the case of dismissal on grounds of political opinion, still less that the Convention imposes a positive obligation to create a free-standing cause of action, without any temporal limitation. This, in our view, is to press the positive obligation too far. In a complex area of social and economic policy, it is in our view pre\u2011eminently for Parliament to decide what areas require special protection in the field of employment and the consequent scope of any exception created to the general rule. The choice of Parliament of race, sex and religion as grounds requiring special protection can in no sense be seen as random or arbitrary. In this respect we attach importance to the fact that certain grounds of difference of treatment have traditionally been treated by the Court itself as \u201csuspect\u201d and as requiring very weighty reasons by way of justification. These grounds include differences of treatment on grounds of race (D.H. and others v the Czech Republic [GC] no. 57325/10, ECHR 2007), sex (Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v the United Kingdom, 28 May 1985, Series A No. 94), religion (Hoffmann v Austria, 23 June 1993, Series A no. 94) and nationality and ethnicity (Timishev v Russia, nos. 55762/00 and 55974/00, ECHR 2005-XII). In addition, the Court has indicated that differences of treatment which are based on immutable characteristics will as a general rule require weightier reasons in justification than differences of treatment based on a characteristic or status which contains an element of choice (Bah v the United Kingdom, no. 56328/07, 27 September 2011).\n5. Doubtless the balance could have been struck by the legislator in a different way and further exceptions to the qualifying period might have been created to cover claims for dismissal of other grounds, including that of political opinion or political affiliation. However, this is a different question from the one which the Court is required to determine, namely whether the United Kingdom exceeded its wide margin of appreciation in not extending the list of exceptions or in not creating a free-standing cause of action covering dismissal on grounds of such opinion or affiliation.\n6. Since, for the reasons given above, we see a justification for treating differently the comparators relied on by the applicant under Article 14, we have voted in favour of the conclusion in the judgment that it is not necessary to examine separately whether there was also a violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 11.", "001-72664": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF YASSAR HUSSAIN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 8866/04)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n7 March 2006\nFINAL\n07/06/2006\nIn the case of Yassar Hussain v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nJosep Casadevall, President,\nNicolas Bratza,\nMatti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4,\nRait Maruste,\nKristaq Traja,\nLjiljana Mijovi\u0107,\nJ\u00e1n \u0160ikuta, judges,\nand Michael O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 February 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. Section 16(2)(b) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 provides that where\n\u201c... any person is tried on indictment and acquitted on any count in the indictment the Crown Court may make a defendant's costs order in favour of the accused\u201d.\n10. Practice Direction (Crime: Defence Costs) [1999] 1 WLR 1832, which was in force at the time of the applicant's trial, provided that:\n\u201cWhere a person is not tried for an offence for which he has been indicted or committed for trial or has been acquitted on any count in the indictment, the court may make a defendant's costs order. Such an order should normally be made whether or not an order for costs inter partes is made, unless there are positive reasons for not doing so, as where, for example, the defendant's own conduct has brought suspicion on himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him is stronger than it is.\u201d\n11. As noted above, no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal against a refusal of a defendant's costs order.\n12. By virtue of section 29(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, the High Court may not exercise its power of judicial review over the Crown Court in matters relating to \u201ctrial on indictment\u201d.\n13. An argument that the incorporation of the Convention into United Kingdom law required a remedy against a refusal of a defendant's costs order was rejected in R (Shields) v. Liverpool Crown Court [2001] EWHC Admin 90, in which Lord Justice Brooke stated that\n\u201c... unless and until Parliament decides to remove the anomaly, that an acquitted defendant has no right of appeal against the refusal of a defendant's costs order, however unjust the refusal may be, he has no Convention right of challenge to his decision in an English court and he is still bound to go to Strasbourg if he wishes to make the assertions he sought to raise unsuccessfully in the Administrative Court\u201d.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that the judge's comments on refusing a defendant's costs order were incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court finds that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n17. The Government submitted that the observations made by the trial judge did not attribute guilt to the applicant either expressly or by clear implication, and that they did not amount in substance to a determination of guilt.\n18. The applicant contended that the judge's comments, at the very least, amounted to the voicing of suspicion in respect of the applicant after final acquittal. He added that one witness, who had stated that she had seen the applicant at least ten times, did not identify him in an identity parade, and that the only witness who did identify the applicant lacked credibility. He submitted that the prosecution should never have been brought.\n19. The Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial required by Article 6 \u00a7 1. It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty unless he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000-X, and A.L. v. Germany, no. 72758/01, \u00a7 31, 28 April 2005). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43). The provision applies even where the substantive criminal proceedings have ended, provided that there is a sufficient nexus between the criminal proceedings and the events in issue (see Sekanina v. Austria, 25 August 1993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 266-A). In such circumstances, the question is whether the trial judge relied on suspicions as to the applicant's innocence after the applicant had been acquitted (ibid., \u00a7 30; see also Moody v. the United Kingdom, no. 22613/93, Commission's report of 16 October 1996, unpublished, and D.F. v. the United Kingdom, no. 22401/93, Commission decision of 24 October 1995, unreported, which both concerned Practice Directions on the making of defendants' costs orders).\n20. However, neither Article 6 \u00a7 2 nor any other provision of the Convention gives a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d a right to compensation for lawful detention on remand where proceedings taken against him are discontinued (see, for example, Sekanina, cited above, \u00a7 25). Further, the Convention does not guarantee a defendant who has been acquitted the right to reimbursement of his costs (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 327\u2011A).\n21. In the present case, the prosecution failed because a key witness declined to attend court, and in the circumstances the prosecution preferred to drop the case rather than compel the witness. There was no question of any conduct by the applicant which could have brought him within the Practice Direction's examples of cases in which a costs order may be refused, and no suggestion that he was in any way responsible for the non-attendance of the witness.\n22. The reasons given by the judge for refusing the costs order were: \u201cThere is clear evidence on the court papers. ... there is compelling evidence in respect of those matters.\u201d The only natural interpretation that can be put on those words is that the judge was refusing the order because he was of the view that, although the key witness had not given evidence and the applicant had been acquitted, the applicant was, in fact, guilty of the offence.\n23. This amounts, in the view of the Court, to a reliance on suspicions as to the applicant's innocence after he had been acquitted, and is incompatible with the presumption of innocence.\n24. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicant also complained that he had had no effective remedy in respect of the breach of Article 6 \u00a7 2, in violation of Article 13 of the Convention, and that if the case had been heard in a magistrates' court, the High Court would have had jurisdiction to consider an application for judicial review. In this latter aspect he alleged a violation of Article 14 of the Convention.\n26. The Court has examined these complaints as they have been submitted and finds that they are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4. In particular, the Court reiterates that Article 13 cannot be read as requiring the provision of an effective remedy that would enable the individual to complain about the absence in domestic law of access to a court as secured by Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 151, ECHR 2000\u2011XI), which is the substance of the applicant's complaint under Article 13.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n28. The applicant made no claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n29. In respect of pecuniary damage and costs, the applicant claimed the costs of the domestic proceedings, including the abortive appeal proceedings, and the costs of the application to the Court. The applicant put his costs at 3,540 pounds sterling (GBP) plus value-added tax (VAT) in respect of solicitors' costs relating to avenues of appeal against the trial judge's order and the application to Strasbourg; GBP 25 plus VAT for a transcript of the Crown Court hearing; GBP 300 plus VAT in respect of counsel's advice on avenues of appeal; and GBP 3,919.50 plus VAT in respect of counsel's fees for the application to Strasbourg (in total approximately 11,336 euros (EUR)).\n30. The Government considered that the applicant's figures were excessive. In particular, they noted that it was clear that no appeal lay against the refusal to make a defendant's costs order, and that no costs should be allowed in respect of advice on appeals. They also noted that the applicant's bill provided no breakdown between sums incurred as to the aborted domestic appeal and those connected with the Strasbourg application. They considered that counsel's fees should have been of the order of GBP 1,500 (approximately EUR 2,185).\n31. The Court makes no award in respect of the costs of the attempted appeal proceedings, no appeal lying against the trial judge's order. As to costs and expenses for the application to the Court, the Court notes that an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 7,500 for the proceedings before the Court.\nDefault interest\n32. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses to be converted into pounds sterling at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 March 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O'Boyle Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President", "001-83625": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF EVC\u0130MEN v.

Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 November 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey (no. 53431/99, \u00a7\u00a7 11-12, 23 October 2003).\n17. By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the official journal on 30 June 2004, the State Security Courts were abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant submitted that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Erzurum State Security Court which tried and convicted him. The applicant relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Government submitted that the application should be declared inadmissible for failure to observe the six-month rule since the final domestic decision had been pronounced by the Court of Cassation on 18 November 1999, in the presence of the applicant's representative, while the application had been lodged on 10 May 2001; i.e. more that six months after the final domestic decision. They further noted that it had not been proven that the application had been lodged on 28 January 2000 because no document bearing the latter date had been communicated to them.\n20. The applicant disputed the Government's submissions and claimed that he had submitted his application to the Court in a letter dated 28 January 2000 within the prescribed time-limit.\n21. Having regard to the documents in its possession, the Court notes that the applicant filed his application in a letter dated 28 January 2000 where he set out the facts and complaints giving rise to the present application. Given that the applicant had learned about the final domestic decision on 18 November 1999, the Court observes that the application was lodged within the six months' time-limit. It therefore dismisses the Government's objection on the alleged failure to observe the six-month rule.\n22. Moreover, the Court considers this complaint not to be manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that, in the instant case, there was no basis on which to find that the applicant could have had any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Erzurum State Security Court. The Government further referred to the abolition of the State Security Courts in 2004.\n24. The Court has examined a large number of cases raising similar issues to those in the present case and in which it found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34; \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 6 February 2003).\n25. The Court finds no reason to reach a different conclusion in the instant case. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. The applicant claimed 379,320 New Turkish liras (YTL) (approximately 202,600 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary damage and YTL 150,000 (approximately EUR 80,115) for non-pecuniary damage.\n28. The Government claimed that the amounts claimed were excessive.\n29. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. It further considers that the finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV, p. 1575, \u00a7 82; \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998\u2011VII, \u00a7 45).\n30. The Court considers that where an individual, as in the instant case, has been convicted by a court which did not meet the Convention requirements of independence and impartiality, a retrial or a reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principle, an appropriate way of redressing the violation (see \u00d6calan v. Turkey, no. 46221/99 [GC], \u00a7 210, in fine, ECHR 2005\u2011IV).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicant also claimed EUR 19,500 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court. The applicant did not submit any receipt or documents in support of his claim.\n32. The Government contended that the applicant's claim was unsubstantiated.\n33. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the above criteria and the applicant's failure to substantiate his claim, the Court makes no award under this heading.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 29 November 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Bo\u0161tjan M.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that his detention on remand exceeded the reasonable time requirement. He also contended that he had no effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of his detention on remand. In respect of his complaints the applicant relied on Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 13 of the Convention. However, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s second complaint should be examined from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4, rather than Article 13.\n17. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention provides as relevant:\nArticle 5 \u00a7 3\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\nArticle 5 \u00a7 4\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n##### 1. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued that, as the applicant had lodged his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on 17 February 2004, the time he had spent in detention between 10 March 1998 and 21 March 2001 should be rejected for having been introduced outside the six-month time-limit laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1.\n19. The Court refers to the principles adopted in the Solmaz v. Turkey judgment (no. 27561/02, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2007\u2011... (extracts)), where it held that, if the applicant is in effect imprisoned throughout, the multiple, consecutive detention periods should be regarded as a whole and the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period. In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand began when he was arrested on 10 March 1998. He was detained within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention until his conviction by the Istanbul State Security Court on 21 March 2001. As from that date, until 8 August 2001, when the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the first-instance court, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) and, therefore, this part of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3. From 8 August 2001 until his release pending trial on 1 November 2004, the applicant was again in pre-trial detention falling under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. As a result, given the applicant\u2019s continued detention throughout these different phases, the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period of pre-trial custody, which is 1 November 2004 (see Akyol v. Turkey, no. 23438/02, \u00a7 25, 20 September 2007).\n20. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.\n21. It further notes this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n22. The Court notes that, as explained above, the period in question began on 10 March 1998 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and ended on 1 November 2004, when the applicant was released pending trial. In line with its case-law, after deducting the time during which the applicant was detained as a convicted prisoner under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention between 21 March 2001 and 8 August 2001, the period to be taken into consideration under Article 5 \u00a7 3 in the instant case is over six years and four months. The domestic courts had constantly extended the applicant\u2019s detention on remand using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence and the state of evidence\u201d.\n23. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 19735/02, 10 May 2007; Solmaz, cited above; Dereci v. Turkey, no. 77845/01, 24 May 2005; Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, 2 February 2006).\n24. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n25. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.\n#### B. Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention\n##### 1. Admissibility\n26. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention for failure to exhaust domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1. Referring to the Court\u2019s decision in the cases of K\u00f6se v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 50177/99, 2 May 2006) and Ba\u015ft\u0131mar and Turkey ((dec.), no. 74337/01, 5 December 2006), the Government maintained that the applicant had failed to object to his continued remand in custody pursuant to Articles 297-304 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the Court finds that these cases cited by the Government may be clearly distinguished on their facts from the present application.\n27. The Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in cases similar to the present application (see Ko\u015fti v. Turkey, no. 74321/01, \u00a7\u00a7 18-24, 3 May 2007). It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence. Consequently, it rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n28. The Court considers this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n29. The Government contended that the domestic law provided an effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand.\n30. The applicant maintained that his objection to his detention had received no serious consideration by the domestic courts, which used stereotyped wording in dismissing his requests.\n31. The Court notes that, in several cases raising similar issues to the present application, it has rejected the Government\u2019s foregoing contention. It concluded that Article 298 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could not be considered an effective remedy and found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Ko\u015fti and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 21\u201125; Nart v. Turkey, no. 20817/04, \u00a7 39, 6 May 2008; \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 71\u201172, ECHR 2005\u2011IV). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from these previous findings.\n32. In conclusion, the Court holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n33. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n34. The Government contested that argument.\n35. The period to be taken into consideration began on 10 March 1998 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and, according to the information in the case file provided by the parties, had not yet ended at the time of the adoption of the present judgment. It has thus lasted more than ten years and six months for two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n36. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n37. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, and the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n38. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above).\n39. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court finds that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n41. The applicant claimed 50,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He further claimed 3,600 new Turkish liras (TRY) in respect of pecuniary damage. In this connection, the applicant submitted that he was suffering from psychological problems and had had to be hospitalised for treatment.\n42. The Government contested the claims.\n43. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, the Court considers that the applicant must have sustained some non-pecuniary damage on account of the undue length of his detention on remand and of the criminal proceedings, which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of violations alone. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him EUR 8,000 under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n44. The applicant also claimed a total of TRY 3,227.70 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. In this respect, he submitted copies of postal expenses amounting to TRY 11.60, equivalent to approximately EUR 6.\n45. The Government contested the claim.\n46. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the applicant has not substantiated that he has actually incurred the costs claimed. Accordingly, it makes no award under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n47. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 8,000 (eight thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, which sum is to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 14 October 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-57990": "\ufeff\nCOURT (GRAND CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BENHAM v.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 January 1996 and 24 May 1996,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions concerning enforcement of payment of the community charge\n19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c).\nThe relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (\u201capplication for a liability order\u201c) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable.\n...\n(5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid.\u201c\nRegulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (\u201clevying of distress\u201c):\n\u201cWhere a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made.\u201c\nRegulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201c(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\n(2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.\n(3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit -\n(a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or\n(b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of the warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.\n...\n(7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ...\u201c\nThe relevant part of Regulation 42 provides:\n(3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed.\u201c\n20. In Regina v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9 October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that \u201cThe proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax.\u201c However, in Regina v. Hebburn Justices, ex parte Martin (31 July 1995, unreported), Mr Justice Sedley in the High Court held that although the initial obligation to pay community charge was a civil one, magistrates \u201cwho have reached the point of committal are entertaining a criminal process\u201c.\n#### B. Appeal from a decision of a magistrates' court by way of case stated\n21. By virtue of section 111 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 a party to proceedings before a magistrates' court may \u201cquestion the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ...\u201c. This is known as the \u201ccase stated\u201c procedure.\n22. Under section 113 of the 1980 Act, magistrates may grant bail to a party who applies to them to state a case; but if they refuse to do so, in cases categorised as \u201ccivil\u201c under the domestic law, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant bail until it is seized of some substantive proceedings to which the grant of bail can be ancillary.\n23. Acts performed pursuant to an order made by a magistrates' court which is subsequently set aside by a superior court are not themselves inherently unlawful. It is at the discretion of the higher court whether these collateral acts are also invalid: Regina v. Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex parte Hague [1992] 1 Appeal Cases 58, 124D-G (per Lord Justice Taylor in the Court of Appeal); London and Clydeside Estates Ltd v. Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 Weekly Law Reports 182, 189C-190C (per Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor, in the House of Lords); Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin PLC [1987] Queen's Bench 815, 840A-C (per Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls).\n#### C. The distinction between an act of a magistrates' court which is merely wrong in law and one which is so wrong as to be in excess of jurisdiction\n24. In English law, orders of a magistrates' court which are in excess of jurisdiction are void from the outset, whereas orders made within jurisdiction remain valid until set aside by a superior court. It is only in respect of the former type of error that a court can be held civilly liable in damages (under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which replaced section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 - see paragraphs 27-28 below).\n25. The appropriate test for whether an order of a magistrates' court is void for lack of jurisdiction is that set out by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan [1985] Appeal Cases 528. In that case magistrates had made an order sending a 14-year-old boy to a training school after a hearing at which he was not legally represented, had not applied for legal aid and had not been informed of his right so to do. The order was quashed on judicial review on the ground that, by virtue of Article 15 (1) of the Treatment of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, magistrates were not permitted to pass a custodial sentence for the first time on a juvenile who was not legally represented, unless he had applied for legal aid and been refused on grounds of means or had been informed of his right to apply for it but had refused or neglected to do so.\nThe boy then applied for damages for false imprisonment against the magistrates. Since the case was decided prior to the enactment of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and at a time when it was the law that magistrates were liable in damages for false imprisonment if they acted in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 26 below), the House of Lords was required to decide the jurisdictional question.\nIn its judgment, a magistrates' court acted in excess of jurisdiction in three circumstances only: (1) if it acted without having jurisdiction over the cause, (2) if it exercised its powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or (3) if it made an order that had no proper foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent. The instant case fell within the third limb of the rule: the magistrates were liable in damages because they had not observed the requirements of Article 15 (1) of the 1976 Order.\nDuring the course of his judgment speech, Lord Bridge commented (at page 546 E-F), on the jurisdiction of magistrates in conducting a criminal trial:\n\u201c... once justices have duly entered upon a summary trial of a matter within their jurisdiction, only something quite exceptional occurring in the course of their proceeding to a determination can oust their jurisdiction ... [A]n error (whether of fact or law) in deciding a collateral issue on which jurisdiction depends will not do so. Nor will the absence of any evidence to support a conviction ...\u201c\n26. The final limb of the rule formulated by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan (that is, that magistrates exceed their jurisdiction when they make an order which has no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent) was applied by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies [1989] 1 All England Reports 30, a case concerning rates (the predecessor to the community charge). Again, the issue was whether magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction and were therefore liable in damages for false imprisonment.\nThe plaintiff had been unable to pay all of the rates for which he became liable in December 1984, and in January 1986 he failed to follow his accountant's advice to close his business and to go bankrupt. Applying legislation similar to Regulation 41 of the Community Charge Regulations, the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant's advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison. The Court of Appeal held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow advice in 1986 and the failure to pay the rates in 1984, and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry (as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect) required by the legislation as a condition precedent of the warrant of commitment. They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages.\nThe three Appeal Court judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms. Lord Justice O'Connor observed that \u201cthey never carried out the inquiry required [by the law]\u201c; Lord Justice Neill found that \u201csome inquiry about the applicant's finances was made\u201c, but that \u201ca clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out. The justices never examined the question whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect\u201c; and Sir Roger Ormrod (who dissented from the majority decision) said: \u201c... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant's failure to pay his rates was `due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect'\u201c (see pp. 637 B, 642 H-643 G and 647 E).\n#### D. The immunity of magistrates from civil proceedings\n27. Magistrates enjoy a statutory immunity from civil liability in certain circumstances. Before the coming into force of section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 on 1 January 1991, this immunity was provided for by sections 44 and 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In brief, a magistrate was liable in damages for acts done by him in his official capacity if it could be proved either (1) that the act was done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause or (2) that it was performed outside or in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 25 above for the meaning of the latter expression).\n28. The position under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 is now that an action lies against a magistrate only if it can be proved that he acted both in bad faith and in excess of jurisdiction:\n\u201cAn action shall lie against any justice of the peace ... in respect of any act or omission of his -\n(a) in the purported execution of his duty -\n(i) as such a justice; ...\n(b) with respect to any matter which is not within his jurisdiction, if, but only if, it is proved that he acted in bad faith.\u201c\n#### E. Legal aid\n29. The legal-aid scheme does not provide for full representation before magistrates for proceedings for committal to prison for non-payment of the community charge. The \u201cGreen Form\u201c scheme provides at least two hours' worth of advice and assistance from a solicitor (the time limit can be extended), including preparation for a court case, but it does not provide for representation.\n30. Assistance by Way of Representation (\u201cABWOR\u201c) enables a magistrates' court, in certain circumstances, to appoint a solicitor who happens to be within the court precincts to represent a party who would not otherwise be represented. Regulation 7 (1) (b) of the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scope) Regulations 1989 provides that ABWOR may be given:\n\u201cat a hearing in any proceedings in a magistrates' court to a party who is not receiving and has not been refused representation in connection with those proceedings, where the court -\n(i) is satisfied that the hearing should proceed on the same day;\n(ii) is satisfied that that party would not otherwise be represented; and\n(iii) requests a solicitor who is within the precincts of the court for purposes other than the provision of ABWOR in accordance with this sub-paragraph, or approves a proposal from such a solicitor, that he provide that party with ABWOR ...\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n31. In his application (no. 19380/92) of 20 September 1991 to the Commission, the applicant complained that his detention between 25 March 1991 and 5 April 1991 was unlawful, in violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1); that section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1989 deprived him of an enforceable right to compensation in respect of it, contrary to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5); and that the fact that full legal aid was not available to him for the committal hearing before the magistrates constituted a violation of Article 6 (art. 6).\n32. The Commission declared the application admissible on 13 January 1994. In its report of 29 November 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by twelve votes to six, that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1); by seventeen votes to one that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5); and by fifteen votes to three that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the five separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment 3.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT\n33. At the hearing on 22 November 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violations of Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention (art. 5, art. 6).\n34. On the same occasion the applicant reiterated his request to the Court, stated in his memorial, to find that there had been breaches of Articles 5 and 6 (art. 5, art. 6) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 1 (art. 5-1) OF THE CONVENTION\n35. The applicant submitted that his detention between 25 March 1991 and 5 April 1991 constituted a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;\n(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201c\nThe Commission agreed with the applicant, whereas the Government contested his allegations.\n36. The applicant argued that the decision of the Divisional Court (see paragraphs 16-17 above) was not distinguishable from that of the Court of Appeal in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above) and amounted in substance to a ruling that his detention had been ordered by the magistrates in excess of their jurisdiction and was thus unlawful under English law. If this was so, it was in violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), which refers back to the position under national law.\nFurthermore, his imprisonment was not covered by any of the sub-paragraphs of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1). It did not result from a criminal conviction as required by Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a), and, since he did not have any way of paying the debt, it could not have been intended to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law within the terms of Article 5 para. 1 (b) (art. 5-1-b).\nIn addition, he argued that his detention was manifestly arbitrary. The Divisional Court found that there was no evidence of culpable neglect and that the magistrates' decision to imprison him was unreasonable in the sense of being irrational or perverse. The magistrates, therefore, acted beyond their powers in imprisoning him, and the imposition of a penalty which is beyond the authorisation of the law is necessarily an arbitrary one.\nFinally, he contended that, since he was denied legal representation in violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6), the detention was for that reason unlawful.\n37. For the Commission, the weight of argument tended to the view that, in domestic law, the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201c as required by Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1).\n38. The Government submitted that Mr Benham's detention was \u201clawful\u201c and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201c for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1). The Community Charge Regulations (see paragraph 19 above) conferred on the magistrates' court the power to send him to prison if they were of the opinion that his failure to pay was due to culpable neglect. Unlike the magistrates in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above), the magistrates in the instant case did carry out the inquiry required by law as to whether Mr Benham's failure to pay resulted from culpable neglect. They made errors of fact and law in answering that question, but the Divisional Court did not find that these errors were such as to deprive them of jurisdiction.\n39. The Court first observes that this case falls to be examined under sub-paragraph (b) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-b), since the purpose of the detention was to secure the fulfilment of Mr Benham's obligation to pay the community charge owed by him.\n40. The main issue to be determined in the present case is whether the disputed detention was \u201clawful\u201c, including whether it complied with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201c. The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see the Quinn v. France judgment of 22 March 1995, Series A no. 311, p. 18, para. 47).\n41. It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see the Bouamar v. Belgium judgment of 29 February 1988, Series A no. 129, p. 21, para. 49).\n42. A period of detention will in principle be lawful if it is carried out pursuant to a court order. A subsequent finding that the court erred under domestic law in making the order will not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention. For this reason, the Strasbourg organs have consistently refused to uphold applications from persons convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by the appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 55, and the report of the Commission of 9 March 1978 on application no. 7629/76, Krzycki v. Germany, Decisions and Reports 13, pp. 60-61).\n43. It was agreed by those appearing before the Court that the principles of English law which should be taken into account in this case distinguished between acts of a magistrates' court which were within its jurisdiction and those which were in excess of jurisdiction. The former were valid and effective unless or until they were overturned by a superior court, whereas the latter were null and void from the outset (see paragraph 24 above).\nIt was further submitted that the appropriate test under English law for deciding whether or not magistrates acted within their jurisdiction was that laid down by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan (see paragraph 25 above). The third limb of that test was relevant to the instant case, namely that magistrates exceeded their jurisdiction when they made an order which had no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent.\nThis limb was applied by the Court of Appeal in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above). In that case the appeal court found that magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction when they committed a man to prison for non-payment of rates without having carried out the inquiry required by law as to whether his failure to pay was due to culpable neglect.\n44. In each of the two cases referred to above it was necessary for the courts to decide the jurisdictional issue, because at the relevant time damages could be awarded against magistrates who acted in excess of jurisdiction. However, section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 has since changed the law to provide that there is no right to damages unless magistrates acted in bad faith (see paragraph 28 above). For this reason, when the Divisional Court reviewed the magistrates' order for Mr Benham's detention, there was no reason under English law for it to decide whether or not the order had been made in excess of jurisdiction.\nMr Justice Potts in the Divisional Court found that the magistrates had carried out some inquiry as to whether Mr Benham's failure to pay the community charge was due to his culpable neglect. However, he concluded that their finding of culpable neglect could not be sustained on the evidence available to them (see paragraph 16 above).\n45. In the view of the Court, there are undoubtedly similarities between this decision and that of the Court of Appeal in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies, but there are also notable differences. In the latter case, the Court of Appeal held that the magistrates had failed altogether to carry out the inquiry required by law as to whether the debtor's failure to pay was the result of culpable neglect (see paragraph 26 above). In the instant case, however, the Divisional Court found that the magistrates had addressed themselves to this question, although their finding of culpable neglect could not be sustained on the available evidence.\n46. Against the above background, it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that the judgment of the Divisional Court was to the effect that the magistrates acted in excess of jurisdiction within the meaning of English law. It follows that the Court does not find it established that the order for detention was invalid, and thus that the detention which resulted from it was unlawful under national law (see the above-mentioned Bouamar judgment p. 21, para. 49). The mere fact that the order was set aside on appeal did not in itself affect the lawfulness of the detention (see paragraph 42 above).\n47. Nor does the Court find that the detention was arbitrary. It has not been suggested that the magistrates who ordered Mr Benham's detention acted in bad faith, nor that they neglected to attempt to apply the relevant legislation correctly (see the above-mentioned Bozano judgment, pp. 25-26, para. 59). It considers the question of the lack of legal aid to be less relevant to the present head of complaint than to that under Article 6 (art. 6) (see paragraph 64 below).\nAccordingly, the Court finds no violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 5 (art. 5-5) OF THE CONVENTION\n48. The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, argued that since he was detained in violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), he was entitled to compensation from public funds in accordance with Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention (art. 5-5), which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article (art. 5) shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\u201c\n49. The Government submitted that Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) did not apply because the applicant's detention was not in contravention of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1).\n50. The Court observes that Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) (see the Wassink v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 185-A, p. 14, para. 38). In view of its finding that there was no violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in this case, it concludes that Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) is not applicable.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6) OF THE CONVENTION\n#### A. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) taken alone\n51. The applicant contended that the fact that he had no automatic right to legal representation at the hearing before the magistrates meant that he was denied access to a fair hearing for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\n52. Since the guarantees in paragraph 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-3) are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial in criminal proceedings guaranteed by paragraph 1 of the same Article (art. 6-1), the Court considers it appropriate to examine this complaint from the perspective of paragraphs 3 (c) and 1 taken together (art. 6-1+6-3-c) (see, for example, the Granger v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 March 1990, Series A no. 174, p. 17, para. 43).\n#### B. Article 6 para. 3 (c) taken together with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1+6-3-c)\n53. The applicant further complained that his lack of legal representation during the proceedings before the magistrates constituted a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cEveryone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\u201c\n##### 1. Applicability\n54. The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, argued that the proceedings before the magistrates involved the determination of a criminal charge for the purposes of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c). He referred to the facts that what was in issue was not a dispute between individuals but rather liability to pay a tax to a public authority, and that the proceedings had many \u201ccriminal\u201c features, such as the safeguards available to defendants aged under 21, the severity of the applicable penalty and the requirement of a finding of culpability before a term of imprisonment could be imposed. Furthermore, it was by no means clear that the proceedings were classified as civil rather than criminal under the domestic law.\n55. The Government argued that Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) did not apply because the proceedings before the magistrates were civil rather than criminal in nature, as was borne out by the weight of the English case-law. The purpose of the detention was to coerce the applicant into paying the tax owed, rather than to punish him for not having paid it.\n56. The case-law of the Court establishes that there are three criteria to be taken into account when deciding whether a person was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201c for the purposes of Article 6 (art. 6). These are the classification of the proceedings under national law, the nature of the proceedings and the nature and degree of severity of the penalty (see the Ravnsborg v. Sweden judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283-B).\nAs to the first of these criteria, the Court agrees with the Government that the weight of the domestic authority indicates that, under English law, the proceedings in question are regarded as civil rather than criminal in nature. However, this factor is of relative weight and serves only as a starting-point (see the Weber v. Switzerland judgment of 22 May 1990, Series A no. 177, p. 17, para. 31).\nThe second criterion, the nature of the proceedings, carries more weight. In this connection, the Court notes that the law concerning liability to pay the community charge and the procedure upon non-payment was of general application to all citizens, and that the proceedings in question were brought by a public authority under statutory powers of enforcement. In addition, the proceedings had some punitive elements. For example, the magistrates could only exercise their power of committal to prison on a finding of wilful refusal to pay or of culpable neglect.\nFinally, it is to be recalled that the applicant faced a relatively severe maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment, and was in fact ordered to be detained for thirty days (see the Bendenoun v. France judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, p. 20, para. 47).\nHaving regard to these factors, the Court concludes that Mr Benham was \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201c for the purposes of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3). Accordingly, these two paragraphs of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3) are applicable.\n##### 2. Compliance\n57. The applicant submitted that the interests of justice required that he ought to have been represented before the magistrates. He referred to the facts that lay magistrates have no legal training and in this case were required to interpret quite complex regulations. If he had been legally represented the magistrates might have been brought to appreciate the error that they were about to make. He asserted, further, that the Green Form and ABWOR schemes which were available to him (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above) were wholly inadequate.\n58. The Government contended that the legal-aid provision available to Mr Benham was adequate, and that the United Kingdom acted within its margin of appreciation in deciding that public funds should be directed elsewhere.\n59. For the Commission, where immediate deprivation of liberty was at stake the interests of justice in principle called for legal representation.\n60. It was not disputed that Mr Benham lacked sufficient means to pay for legal assistance himself. The only issue before the Court is, therefore, whether the interests of justice required that Mr Benham be provided with free legal representation at the hearing before the magistrates. In answering this question, regard must be had to the severity of the penalty at stake and the complexity of the case (see the Quaranta v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 205, pp. 17-18, paras. 32-38).\n61. The Court agrees with the Commission that where deprivation of liberty is at stake, the interests of justice in principle call for legal representation (see the above-mentioned Quaranta judgment p. 17, para. 33). In this case, Mr Benham faced a maximum term of three months' imprisonment.\n62. Furthermore, the law which the magistrates had to apply was not straightforward. The test for culpable negligence in particular was difficult to understand and to operate, as was evidenced by the fact that, in the judgment of the Divisional Court, the magistrates' finding could not be sustained on the evidence before them.\n63. The Court has regard to the fact that there were two types of legal-aid provision available to Mr Benham. Under the Green Form scheme he was entitled to up to two hours' advice and assistance from a solicitor prior to the hearing, but the scheme did not cover legal representation in court (see paragraph 29 above). Under the ABWOR scheme, the magistrates could at their discretion have appointed a solicitor to represent him, if one had happened to be in court (see paragraph 30 above). However, Mr Benham was not entitled as of right to be represented.\n64. In view of the severity of the penalty risked by Mr Benham and the complexity of the applicable law, the Court considers that the interests of justice demanded that, in order to receive a fair hearing, Mr Benham ought to have benefited from free legal representation during the proceedings before the magistrates. In conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention taken together (art. 6-1+6-3-c).\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\n65. The applicant sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\n#### A. Non-pecuniary damage\n66. Mr Benham claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the violation of Article 6 (art. 6).\n67. The Government pointed out that Mr Benham was legally represented from 28 March 1991 onwards, when an unsuccessful bail application was made on his behalf, and that any time spent in prison after that date could not be attributed to his lack of representation at the hearing.\n68. The Court considers, particularly in view of the impossibility of speculating as to whether the magistrates would have made the order for Mr Benham's detention had he been represented at the hearing before them, that the finding of a violation is sufficient satisfaction.\n#### B. Legal fees and expenses\n69. The applicant further sought reimbursement of costs and expenses totalling \u00a326,523.80.\n70. The Government objected that the amounts claimed by the applicant were excessive. They submitted that, if the Court were to find for the applicant on all counts, a figure of \u00a323,293.94 should be substituted for that sought.\nHowever, in the event that the Court found violations in respect of certain claims only, the costs and expenses allowed should be reduced proportionately.\n71. In view of the fact that the Court finds a violation in respect of one of the applicant's complaints only, it considers that \u00a310,000 (VAT included) is an appropriate amount for the respondent Government to pay towards the applicant's legal costs and expenses, less the 25,510 French francs already paid in legal aid by the Council of Europe.\n#### C. Default interest\n72. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds by seventeen votes to four that there has been no violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1);\n2. Holds by seventeen votes to four that Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention (art. 5-5) is not applicable;\n3. Holds unanimously that there has been a violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention taken together (art. 6-1+6-3-c);\n4. Holds by nineteen votes to two that the finding of a violation constitutes adequate satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant;\n##### 5. Holds unanimously\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, in respect of costs and expenses, \u00a310,000 (ten thousand pounds sterling) less 25,510 (twenty-five thousand, five hundred and ten) French francs to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n6. Dismisses, unanimously, the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction in respect of costs and expenses.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 10 June 1996.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nHerbert PETZOLD\nRegistrar\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the partly dissenting opinions of Mr Bernhardt, Mr Th\u00f3r Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Mr De Meyer and Mr Foighel are annexed to this judgment.\nR.R.\n#### H.P.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE BERNHARDT\nIn my view there is a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) (and consequently also of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5)) of the Convention in the present case.\nI leave aside my doubts whether a prison sentence is in the circumstances of the case proportionate to the failure of Mr Benham to pay a community charge. Detention may in such a case be appropriate if there exists a chance that the detainee can and will pay the charge under such pressure. But if it is undisputed that the detained person has no means to pay the charge, a prison sentence is in my view hardly compatible with the proper role of criminal sanctions in present-day societies. But this is not the final reason of my dissent.\nI understand Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) in the sense that the words \u201clawful detention\u201c refer to the conformity of the decision ordering the detention with national law, in so far as the material and procedural conditions contained in national law must be satisfied. In the present case, it is clear from the decision of the Divisional Court that under English law the magistrates should not have sent Mr Benham to prison.\nThe present decision of the Court goes further and understands the reference to national law in the sense that a detention which has been ordered in violation of national law remains nevertheless lawful if under national law the deciding judge or magistrate acted inside his jurisdiction, if he did not act in bad faith, and if the order was not void ab initio. This understanding of Article 5 (art. 5) has far-reaching consequences. Even if the conditions provided for by national law are not satisfied, the detention remains nevertheless \u201clawful\u201c if the national law distinguishes (which is often not the case) between decisions which are void ab initio and other decisions. Such a distinction - which leads often, including in the present case, to extremely unclear results - neglects the situation and the interests of the detained person. Decisive are the degree of the violation of the national law, the corresponding error of the judge concerned and the difference between void and \u201cvoidable\u201c decisions. In my view, Article 5 (art. 5) refers to national law only in so far as the original detention order must be compatible with that law.\nI do not think that the comparison drawn in paragraph 42 of the judgment with convictions which are subsequently quashed by a higher court is convincing. The present case concerns exclusively the question whether the detention was \u201clawful\u201c at the time when the detention order was made.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE TH\u00d3R VILHJ\u00c1LMSSON\nTo my regret, I have not found it possible to follow the majority of the Court on the question whether there was a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1).\nThe Commission came to the conclusion that \u201cthe weight of the argument before it tends to be of the view that, in domestic law, the applicant's detention was not lawful\u201c (Commission's report, paragraph 48).\nThe Court, on the other hand, did \u201cnot find it established that the order for detention was invalid, and thus that the detention which resulted from it was unlawful under national law ...\u201c.\nThe arguments for and against these different conclusions are complicated and I am left in some uncertainty as to how to assess them.\nThis uncertainty reveals that the national law is far from clear, yet what is in issue is an important question concerning personal liberty.\nAs stated by the Court in the Bozano judgment, \u201cLawfulness, in any event, also implies absence of any arbitrariness ...\u201c (Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 59).\nAs in that judgment, the particular circumstances of the case are relevant. Mr Benham was ordered to be detained for thirty days, and actually served eleven days, for failure to pay a community charge, in all \u00a3355, costs included. He had no personal assets or income, but the English magistrates found that he clearly had the potential to earn money to discharge his obligation to pay.\nIn my opinion, the warrant issued by the magistrates was very severe in the circumstances.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) was violated.\nConsequently, I find Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) to be applicable. There was therefore, obviously, also a violation of that provision (art. 5-5).\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\nI have no doubt that the purpose of the legal provision under which the applicant was deprived of his liberty was to \u201csecure the fulfilment of\u201c an \u201cobligation prescribed by law\u201c.\nHowever, since he had failed to fulfil the obligation concerned and since that failure was found by the magistrates' court to be due to his culpable neglect, the detention as such was, in my view, a punishment \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201c 4. It was indeed a sanction imposed on him on account of conduct considered reprehensible 5. That also suffices for me to conclude that he was entitled to enjoy the rights recognised in Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) 6.\nAs far as Article 5 (art. 5) is concerned, I agree with Mr Foighel for the reasons set forth in his dissenting opinion 7, that the applicant's detention was not lawful.\nAs to Article 6 (art. 6), it is enough for me to see that he was not assisted by counsel before the magistrates' court and that it has not been shown either that he had willingly and knowingly waived such assistance or that the interests of justice did not require it in the instance concerned 8.\nFinally, I feel that the Court should have granted some financial compensation to the applicant.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE FOIGHEL\nIt has been constantly held by this Court that the right to liberty and security of person in Article 5 (art. 5) is one of the fundamental rights in the Convention.\nThe Court's starting-point should therefore be that any exceptions to this rule are to be interpreted narrowly.\nThe exception relevant to this case is Article 5 para. 1 (b) (art. 5-1-b), which permits\n\u201c(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\u201c\nIt is obvious that the Convention here essentially refers back to national law and lays an obligation on the national authority to comply with the substantive and procedural rules of that law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness.\nThe duty of interpreting and applying domestic law falls, in the first place, to the national authorities, notably the courts.\nIf, however, the national law is obscure or uncertain, or if different interpretations of it are equally possible, it is incumbent on this Court - for the purpose of interpreting and implementing the Convention - to choose the interpretation of the national law which most closely corresponds with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness.\nIn this case the Divisional Court found at the hearing in October 1991 that the magistrates' decision to commit Mr Benham to prison had been unlawful. The Divisional Court was, however, silent as to whether Mr Benham's detention was unlawful from the start or whether it was unlawful only subsequent to the Divisional Court's decision. Further, it appeared from the addresses to the Court that - according to some interpretations of the English case-law - both interpretations were possible.\nAgainst this background I would hold that in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) the detention of Mr Benham was unlawful from the start, as the detention of a young man for thirty days for not having paid a tax of \u00a3325 is in itself, notwithstanding technical arguments, a flagrant violation of the liberty of person protected by the Convention.\nConsequently, I find Mr Benham entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage in accordance with Article 50 (art. 50).", "001-57642": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF DARBY v. SWEDEN\n(Application no. 11581/85)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n23 October 1990\nIn the Darby case\uf02a,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court\uf02a\uf02a, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr L.-E. Pettiti,\nMr C. Russo,\nMr A. Spielmann,\nMr N. Valticos,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr I. Foighel,\nand also of Mr M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 May 1990 and on 24 September 1990,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Taxation in general\n17. The provisions regarding municipal income taxation in general are included in the Municipal Tax Act 1928, which has been amended on numerous occasions over the years. The references below to this Act and to other enactments are all to the version in force during the relevant period (1979-1981), unless otherwise stated.\n18. Liability to pay tax in Sweden was regulated in section 53, subsection 1, of the Municipal Tax Act: residents of Sweden were taxed on their world-wide income whereas non-residents had a more limited liability, covering, inter alia, income derived from employment in the Swedish public service.\nUnder Article 19 of the convention with Finland for the avoidance of double taxation (published in svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling (\u201cSFS\u201c - the official journal), 1977:812), the right to tax income derived from public service vested in the State which paid the remuneration (with certain exceptions not relevant here).\n19. Regarding the place of taxation in Sweden, section 59, subsections 1 and 3, of the Municipal Tax Act provided that income earned by a resident from employment was to be taxed in the municipality where he was formally registered as a resident (mantalsskriven).\nAccording to the Tax (Common Municipal Purposes) Act (lag om skatt f\u00f6r gemensamt kommunal \u00e4ndam\u00e5l), income earned by a non-resident from employment in, inter alia, the Swedish public service was to be taxed in Stockholm in the so-called Common District. The tax rate (10 per cent) applicable in this district was lower than the ordinary municipal tax rate. The tax levied was not destined for any specific municipality but was used for levelling out the burden of taxation between different municipalities or other administrative authorities. It did not include any tax payable to the Church of Sweden.\n20. As a result of an amendment to section 68 of the Municipal Tax Act and subsection 1 of the instructions relating to section 66 of the same Act (SFS 1978:925), certain non-residents were considered, with effect from 1 January 1979, to have sufficient connection with Sweden to be liable to pay the full municipal tax. The Government Bill (1978/79:58) containing these amendments did not mention the problems which might result for non-residents in relation to the Dissenters Tax Act.\nHenceforth, a non-resident with certain types of income, such as that derived from employment in the public service, and with a temporary abode in Sweden was no longer taxed in the Common District but in the municipality where he had first lived. This meant that he had to pay municipal tax at the same rate as a resident and also church tax.\n#### B. The church tax\n21. The church tax is collected together with the ordinary municipal tax. The rate is determined by the local parish council. This system has a long tradition and is based on the fact that the Lutheran Church of Sweden is the established church. Under the transitional provisions of the 1974 Constitution (regeringsformen), its parishes have a status similar to that of the municipalities - including the right of taxation.\n22. The Dissenters Tax Act was enacted in 1951 at the same time as the Freedom of Religion Act (lag 1951:680 om religionsfrihet) in order to secure better respect for freedom of religion (see Government Bill 1951:175, p. 75). Section 1 of the Dissenters Tax Act, made the following provision for a reduction in the church tax:\n\u201cChurch tax which is referred to in the 1961 Act on parish administration (lag 1961:436 om f\u00f6rsamlingsstyrelse) and is imposed either by decision of a parish council or otherwise in accordance with the principles that apply to the imposition of municipal tax, shall be levied on a person who was not a member of the Church of Sweden at the beginning of the tax year and who is formally registered as resident (mantalsskriven) in this country for the tax year at only 30 per cent of the amount assessed.\u201c\nThe registration requirement meant that the Dissenters Tax Act did not apply to persons who had only a temporary abode in Sweden. According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the Act, the reasons for this were that the case for reduction could not be argued with the same force in regard to persons who were not resident in Sweden as it could in regard to those who were, and that the procedure would be more complicated if the reduction applied to non-residents (Government Bill 1951:175, p.144).\nThe 30 per cent of the church tax that remained after the reduction was supposed to cover the costs borne by the parishes of certain administrative functions such as the keeping of population records and the maintenance of churchyards and other public burial-grounds.\n23. With effect from 1 January 1987, section 1 of the Dissenters Tax Act was amended in order to take into account the criticism made by the Parliamentary Ombudsman (see paragraph 15 above), so that the taxpayer no longer has to be registered as resident in Sweden in order to benefit from the reduction of the church tax (Government Bill 1986/87:45, p. 15).\n#### C. Membership of the Swedish Church\n24. Under the Freedom of Religion Act, as worded before 15 November 1979, membership of the Swedish Church was reserved to Swedish citizens and foreigners living in Sweden. In 1979 an amendment (SFS 1979:929) opened membership also to other groups of persons. In order to leave the Church, it is sufficient for the person concerned to notify his resignation to the church authorities of his parish. Special rules apply to minors.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n25. In his application of 20 November 1984 to the Commission (no. 11581/85), Dr Darby alleged violations of Article 6 para. 1 and Article 9 (art. 6-1, art. 9) of the Convention. He contended that he had been discriminated against by the Swedish authorities while working in Sweden because he was a Finnish citizen domiciled in the archipelago of \u00c5land; and he also challenged the interpretation of the Dissenters Tax Act to the effect that he had to pay the full church tax and claimed that this obligation infringed his civil rights.\n26. On 11 April 1988 the Commission declared admissible the complaint that he had been obliged to pay church tax and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\nIn its report of 9 May 1989 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that:\n(a) there had been a violation of Article 9 (art. 9) (by ten votes to three) and also of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 9 (art. 14+9) by nine votes to four);\n(b) it was not necessary to examine whether there had been a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1) (by eleven votes to two).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n27. Dr Darby complained of the fact that between 1979 and 1981 he had had to pay 3,065 Swedish kronor (see paragraph 16 above) as a special tax to the Church of Sweden to finance its religious activities. In his opinion, this amounted to a breach of Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention and also of Article 14 of the Convention taken together either with Article 9 (art. 14+9) or with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art.14+P1-1).\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 (art. 14+P1-1)\n28. Considering that the applicant\u2019s grievances relate mainly to allegedly discriminatory effects of the Swedish tax legislation, the Court finds it more natural to examine the case under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1), which concerns the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.\n29. Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention reads:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention\u201c - and in Protocol No. 1 (Article 5 thereof) (P1-5) - \u201cshall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201c\nUnder Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1):\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201c\nDr Darby claimed that the refusal to grant him an exemption from the impugned part of the church tax on the ground merely that he was not formally registered as a resident in Sweden amounted to a discrimination in comparison with other non-members of the Church who were so registered.\nThis view was shared by two dissenting members of the Commission, whereas the Government maintained that it would be out of proportion to regard this distinction in treatment as constituting prohibited discrimination.\n30. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, second paragraph (P1-1-2), establishes that the duty to pay tax falls within its field of application. Accordingly, Article 14 (art. 14) is also applicable (see, mutatis mutandis, the Inze judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, pp. 17-18, paras. 36-40).\n31. Article 14 (art. 14) protects individuals placed in similar situations from discrimination in their enjoyment of their rights under the Convention and its Protocols. However, a difference in the treatment of one of these individuals will only be discriminatory if it \u201chas no objective and reasonable justification\u201c, that is if it does not pursue a \u201clegitimate aim\u201c and if there is no \u201creasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\u201c (see, amongst other authorities, the above-mentioned Inze judgment, ibidem, p. 18, para. 41).\n32. It appears first that Dr Darby can claim to have been, as regards his right to an exemption under the Dissenters Tax Act, in a situation similar to that of other non-members of the Church who were formally registered as residents in Sweden.\n33. As regards the aim of this difference in the treatment of residents and non-residents, it is worth noting the following. According to the Government Bill (1951:175) which gave raise to the Dissenters Tax Act, the reason why the right to exemption was reserved for persons formally registered as residents was that the case for reduction could not be argued with the same force in regard to persons who were not so registered as it could in regard to those who were, and that the procedure would be more complicated if the reduction was to apply to non-residents (see paragraph 22 above). The Government Bill (1978/79:58) containing the tax- law amendments that brought about this complaint did not mention the special situation which the amendments would create for non-residents under the Dissenters Tax Act (see paragraph 20 above). In fact, the Government stated at the hearing before the Court that they did not argue that the distinction in treatment had a legitimate aim.\n34. In view of the above, the measure complained of cannot be seen as having had any legitimate aim under the Convention. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 9 (art. 9) OF THE CONVENTION, TAKEN EITHER ALONE OR TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 14 (art. 14+9)\n35. Having regard to the circumstances of the case and to the conclusion in the preceding paragraph, the Court does not find it necessary to examine also the applicant\u2019s complaint of a violation of his freedom of religion, as guaranteed by Article 9 (art. 9), or of discrimination contrary to Article 14 (art. 14) in his enjoyment of this right.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\n36. According to Article 50 (art. 50):\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\nThe applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of his costs and expenses. The Government contested part of the claims; the Delegate of the Commission refrained from making any comments.\n#### A. Pecuniary damage\n37. As regards pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed repayment of the excess tax he had paid between 1979 and 1981, that is 3,065 Swedish kronor (see paragraph 16 above), plus interest calculated in accordance with the Swedish Interest Act (r\u00e4ntelagen) from the year in which the taxes were levied until the date of reimbursement. While accepting this claim in principle, the Government maintained that the Swedish Interest Act was not applicable. However, they left it to the Court to determine whether the amount claimed should be increased on an equitable basis.\n38. The Court awards Dr Darby 8,000 kronor under this head, comprising the amount of tax unduly paid in 1979-1981 (3,065 kronor) and interest assessed in the light of the interest rates in Sweden at the time.\n#### B. Non-pecuniary damage\n39. The applicant also sought 50,000 kronor as compensation for non-pecuniary damage. He submitted that:\n(a) he had suffered from having to contribute directly to the religious activities of a foreign church;\n(b) he had had to challenge, without the assistance of a lawyer, his obligation to pay church tax in several court proceedings in Sweden, and the ensuing work had caused him stress and considerable loss of time although he had not actually incurred any costs;\n(c) he had also experienced stress as a result of the measures he took to adjust his life in accordance with the National Tax Board\u2019s advance ruling (see paragraph 11 above).\nIn the Government\u2019s view, the state of affairs complained of was not of such significance as to justify compensation in the amount claimed.\n40. As the Government pointed out, the applicant\u2019s claims under item (c) must be considered irrelevant in relation to the violation found, as the obligation to pay the church tax cannot be said to have required the taking of such measures. For the rest, the Court agrees with the Government that the main aim of Dr Darby\u2019s domestic proceedings was to be taxed in the so-called Common District, where, besides being exempt from the church tax, he would have enjoyed a generally more favourable tax treatment (see paragraph 19 above).\nIn sum, the present judgment provides sufficient just satisfaction for any mental suffering.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n41. The applicant claimed 11,575 kronor for his costs in the proceedings before the Commission, in which he appeared without legal counsel. As to the proceedings before the Court, he sought 18,278 kronor for his lawyer\u2019s expenses, 129,500 kronor for his lawyer\u2019s fee and 14,000 kronor for his own attendance at the hearing.\nThe Government considered the lawyer\u2019s fee to be somewhat high and left to the Court the question of compensating Dr Darby for his own attendance. They accepted the other items.\n42. Making an equitable assessment and taking into account the sums paid in legal aid by the Council of Europe, the Court awards the applicant 90,000 kronor under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1);\n2. Holds that it is not necessary to examine the case under Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention taken either alone or together with the said Article 14 (art. 14+9);\n3. Holds that Sweden is to pay the applicant 8,000 (eight thousand) Swedish kronor for pecuniary damage and 90,000 (ninety thousand) kronor for costs and expenses;\n4. Rejects the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 October 1990.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 EISSEN\nRegistrar", "001-67085": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF YANIKO\u011eLU v.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant alleged in particular that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained that the national courts had based their decisions on his police statement which had been taken under duress. Finally, he argued that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time. In this respect he invoked Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention.\n#### A. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicant was complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court, he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 27 November 1997.\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined in several cases similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six months\u2019 rule and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003 and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instance case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n20. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n21. In the light of its established case law (see, amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raise complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Independence and impartiality of the State Security Court\n22. The Government maintained that the state security courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubt about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on state security courts.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36).\n24. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for being a member of an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fear as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n25. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. Fairness of the proceedings\n26. Having regard to its finding that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n##### 3. Length of the criminal proceedings\n27. The Government denied the applicant\u2019s allegation. They argued that the case was of a complex nature and that the national courts had to organise a trial involving fifteen defendants, all of whose involvement with the TDKP/GKB had to be established. They further maintained that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities.\n28. The Court observes that that the proceedings began on 12 November 1991 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and ended on 11 September 1998 with the decision of the Court of Cassation, upholding the applicant\u2019s conviction. They therefore lasted six years and nine months.\n29. The Court recalls in the first place that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, amongst many others, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n30. The Court considers that even though the case involved a certain degree of complexity since it involved the prosecution of fifteen accused persons, it cannot be said that this in itself justified the total length of the proceedings.\n31. As regards the conduct of the applicant, the Court observes that it does not appear from the case-file that he contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n32. Concerning the conduct of the authorities, the Court notes that the instant case was examined in four levels of jurisdiction within six years and nine months. It observes however that there is a significant period of delay which is attributable to the authorities. In this respect, it observes that when the Court of Cassation remitted the case before the Ankara State Security Court for further examination, it took the first instance court three years and nine months to render its decision. The Court further observes that the criminal case against the applicant was in fact ready for decision on 27 May 1994 at the latest, because all but one of the defendants had submitted their final observations by that date. Regardless of this fact, the proceedings continued for three more years as the first instance court held thirty-three more hearings in search of this defendant who was on the run.\n33. Recalling that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligation to decide cases within a reasonable time (see Arvelakis v. Greece, no. 41354/98, \u00a7 26, 12 April 2001), the Court considers that the domestic court could have applied stricter measures to speed up the proceedings. It therefore finds that the proceedings in the instant case were unnecessarily prolonged as the national court had failed to act with the necessary diligence in conducting the proceedings against the applicant.\n34. In view of the above, the Court considers that the length of the proceedings cannot be considered to have complied with the reasonable time requirement laid down under Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n35. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n37. The applicant claimed 95,000 US dollars in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n38. The Government did not address this issue.\n39. On the question of pecuniary damage, the Court considers in the first place that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 would have been. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s claims in respect of pecuniary damage are not supported by any evidence whatsoever. The Court can therefore not allow them.\n40. The Court further considers that the finding of a violation of Article 6 constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant in this respect (see Incal, cited above, p. 1575, \u00a7 82, and \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n41. Where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted by a tribunal which is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant is granted in due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003).\n42. As to the unreasonable length of the criminal proceedings, the Court accepts that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage, such as distress and frustration on account of the duration of the proceedings, which cannot be sufficiently compensated by finding of a violation. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and having regard to its case-law, the Court awards the applicant a total sum of 1,800 euros (EUR) under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n43. Without requesting a specific amount, the applicant asked to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses incurred during the proceedings before the Court.\n44. The Government did not make a comment on this issue.\n45. Making its own estimate based on the information available, and having regard to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among other authorities, Ahmet Ko\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 32580/96, \u00a7 40, 22 June 2004 and \u00c7alo\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 55812/00, \u00a7 33, 29 July 2004), the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 2,000 in respect of costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n46. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint relating to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court;\n3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint relating to the length of the proceedings;\n4. Holds that there is no need to examine the remaining complaint submitted under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n5. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant in respect of his complaint relating to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court;\n##### 6. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish Liras at the rate applicable at the date of the settlement and free of any taxes that may be chargeable;\n(i) EUR 1,800 (one thousand eight hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage in respect of his complaint concerning the length of the proceedings;\n(ii) EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n7. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 14 October 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nVincent Berger Georg Ress\nRegistrar President", "001-94744": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF G\u00dcROVA v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer while he was in police custody.\n11. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n12. As regards the merits, the Government maintained that, in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings. As the applicant was represented by a lawyer during the proceedings before the State Security Court and the Court of Cassation, his right to a fair hearing had not been violated.\n13. The Court observes that it has already examined the same grievance in the case of Salduz v. Turkey and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-62, 27 November 2008). It has also examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned Salduz judgment.\n14. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained under Article 3 that he had been subjected to psychological torture in police custody. Relying on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, he further complained that he had been held in police custody for a long time. Under Article 6, the applicant alleged that the State Security Court which had tried and convicted him was not an independent and impartial tribunal. He also complained about the length of the proceedings. Finally, the applicant alleged that his conviction, which was based on his visit to Iran, had been in violation of Article 7 of the Convention.\n16. However, the Court finds nothing whatsoever in the case file which might disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly-ill founded and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant requested 40,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 30,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He further claimed EUR 7,500 for legal fees and EUR 500 for costs and expenses. In respect of his claims, the applicant submitted a legal fee agreement.\n18. The Government contested the claims.\n19. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, ruling on an equitable basis, it awards EUR 1,500 to the applicant.\n20. The Court further considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the retrial of the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should the applicant so request (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 72).\n21. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court finds it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000 under this head.\n22. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares admissible the complaint concerning the lack of legal assistance to the applicant while in police custody, and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 6 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-96264": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF AKYAZICI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time and subsequent changes to domestic legislation are outlined in the following judgments; G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey, [GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-V, and Erdal Ta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 77650/01, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, 19 December 2006.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained that the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. The applicant relied on Article 6 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Government suggested that, since the applicant had been acquitted in 2004, he could no longer be considered a victim. The Government invited the Court to strike the application out of the Court's list of cases in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n17. The applicant disagreed with the Government's arguments and maintained his complaints.\n18. The Court reiterates that \u201ca decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a 'victim' unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention\u201d (see Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999-VI). Only when these conditions are satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude examination of an application (see, for example, Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 52620/99, 20 March 2003).\n19. The Court notes that in 2002 the applicant was convicted by the Ankara State Security Court. He was sentenced to a fine and to two years and six months' imprisonment. It is true that following an amendment in domestic law the applicant subsequently had a retrial and, in 2004, was acquitted of the charges against him. However, the Court notes that, in the meantime, the applicant had already served his prison sentence. In the absence of any submissions by the Government concerning the possible avenues provided for in the domestic law for claiming compensation in respect of these periods, the Court cannot but observe that, as matters stand, no compensation has been paid to the applicant for any violation of his right in the first trial. The Court therefore concludes that the Government's objection that the applicant can no longer be considered a victim cannot be upheld.\n20. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n21. The Court notes that it has already examined the same grievance in the past and has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, in particular, G\u00f6\u00e7, cited above, \u00a7 58; Abdullah Ayd\u0131n v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 63739/00, \u00a7 30, 10 November 2005; and Ay\u00e7oban and Others v. Turkey, nos. 42208/02, 43491/02 and 43495/02, 22 December 2005).\n22. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned cases.\n23. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n24. In his application form and subsequent observations the applicant further complained under Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal and that the outcome of the proceedings had been unfair. He further complained of the manner in which the evidence had been gathered and assessed by the domestic authorities. The applicant claimed that his conviction and sentence had constituted an unjustified interference with his freedom of expression. He further pointed out that as a result of the criminal proceedings he had been dismissed from Kars State Hospital and that despite his acquittal he had not been reinstated in his previous post.\n25. However, in the light of all the material in its possession, the Court finds that the applicants' above submissions do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application must be declared inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. The applicant claimed, in total, 201,600 new Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 115,714 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary and non\u2011pecuniary damages. The sum for pecuniary damages concerned loss of earnings.\n28. The Government contested the amounts.\n29. On the question of pecuniary damage, even assuming that there was any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged, the Court considers that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 would have been. The Court therefore makes no award in respect of pecuniary damage.\n30. Moreover, it considers that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant (see Ay\u00e7oban and Others, cited above, \u00a7 32; Tur\u011fay v. Turkey, no. 21085/02, \u00a7 24, 12 April 2007; and Mesut Yurtsever v. Turkey, no. 42086/02, \u00a7 23, 19 July 2007).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicant also claimed, in total, TRY 41,527 (approximately EUR 23,835) for the costs and expenses incurred both before the domestic courts, including administrative proceedings, and before the Court. The applicant submitted a fees agreement concluded between him and his lawyer and some receipts pertaining to postal and court fees.\n32. The Government contested the amounts.\n33. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 2,500 covering costs under all heads.\n#### C. Default interest\n34. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the non\u2011communication of the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to the applicant admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,500 (two thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n11. At the material time Article 16 of Law no. 2845 on the Establishment and Rules of Procedures of State Security Courts provided:\n\u201cAny person arrested in connection with an offence within the jurisdiction of State Security Courts shall be brought before a judge and questioned within forty-eight hours at the latest, not including the time needed to convey the detainee to the judge.\nIf the offence is a joint one committed by three or more persons, this period can be prolonged for up to four days by a written order of the public prosecutor owing to the difficulties in collecting evidence or to the number of perpetrators, or for similar causes. If the investigation is not concluded within this period, it can be prolonged for up to seven days upon the request of the public prosecutor and the decision of the judge.\nThe period of seven days referred to in the second paragraph can be prolonged for up to ten days upon the request of the public prosecutor and by decision of the judge in respect of persons arrested in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution.\n...\u201d\n12. At the material time, according to Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any person who was arrested and/or in respect of whom a prosecutor made an order for his or her continued detention, could challenge that measure before the appropriate district judge and, if successful, be released.\n13. Article 1 of Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained provides:\n\u201cCompensation shall be paid by the State in respect of all damage sustained by persons:\n(1) who have been arrested, or detained under conditions or in circumstances incompatible with the Constitution or statute;\n(2) who have not been immediately informed of the reasons for their arrest or detention;\n(3) who have not been brought before a judicial officer after being arrested or detained within the time allowed by statute for that purpose;\n(4) who have been deprived of their liberty without a court order after the statutory time allowed for being brought before a judicial officer has expired;\n(5) whose close family have not been immediately informed of their arrest or detention;\n(6) who, after being arrested or detained in accordance with the law, are not subsequently committed for trial ..., or are acquitted or discharged after standing trial;\n(7) who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment shorter than the period spent in detention or ordered to pay a pecuniary penalty only...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicants complained under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that the length of their detention in custody was excessive.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n15. The Government submitted that the application should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Government argued that, pursuant to Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicants could have challenged the length of their detention in custody. They further maintained that the applicants could have sought compensation pursuant to Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained.\n16. The applicants argued that the remedies suggested by the Government were ineffective. They submitted that, since the length of their detention in custody had been in conformity with the domestic law applicable at the time of their arrest, any application under Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or the provisions of Law no. 466 would have been useless.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na. As regards the applicant Erdal G\u00fcler\n17. The Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether Erdal G\u00fcler has exhausted domestic remedies, as his complaint is manifestly ill-founded for the following reason.\n18. The Court notes that, according to the documents submitted to the Court, Erdal G\u00fcler was taken into custody at 2 p.m. on 27 September 2000 by officers from the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command and left the gendarmerie command at 11 a.m. on 1 October 2000. The Court observes that the period in question is less than ninety-six hours.\n19. Having regard to its jurisprudence in similar cases, and bearing in mind the context in which he was detained, the Court considers that the length of Erdal G\u00fcler\u2019s detention in custody does not contravene the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention since he was brought before a judge less than four days after his arrest (see \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v. Turkey (dec.), no. 44093/98, 26 September 2000).\n20. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\nb. As regards the applicants Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar\n21. The Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in similar cases (see, for example, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 66-71, ECHR 2005\u2011..., and Buldu\u015f v. Turkey, no. 64741/01, \u00a7\u00a7 10-14, 22 December 2005). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence.\n22. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection. It further notes that this part of the application is not inadmissible on any other grounds and must, therefore, be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The applicants complained that they had been held in custody for an excessive length of time without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power as provided in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n24. The Government argued that the length of the applicants\u2019 detention in custody was in conformity with the legislation in force at the time. Given that the relevant law has since been amended in accordance with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence, the applicants\u2019 allegation was groundless.\n25. The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 detention in \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command lasted eight days. It reiterates that, in the case of Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict time constraints of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism (judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 62).\n26. Even though the investigation of terrorist offences, as was relied on by the Government in this case, presents the authorities with special problems, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain the applicants for eight days without judicial intervention.\n27. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicants claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) and EUR 5,000 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary and pecuniary damage respectively.\n30. The Government contested the amounts requested by the applicants and proposed that the finding of a violation would constitute in itself sufficient compensation.\n31. As regards the alleged pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants, the Court observes that they have not produced any document in support of their claim, which the Court, accordingly, dismisses.\n32. With regard to non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the applicants have sustained non-pecuniary damage which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar EUR 1,800 each.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n33. The applicants also claimed EUR 5,300 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and for those incurred before the Court.\n34. The Government contested this claim. They maintained that only expenses actually incurred can be reimbursed.\n35. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his or her costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar, jointly, the sum of EUR 1,000 for costs and expenses for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n36. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the part of the application concerning Erdal G\u00fcler inadmissible;\n2. Declares the remainder of the application admissible in respect of the applicants Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay Resul Sadak, Nihat Osal, Mehmet \u00c7akar, Rustem Bayar, Tahir Kutlu, Cengiz Bal\u0131k, \u0130zzet Belge, Abdurrazak \u0130nan, Mehmet Temelkuran, Mehmet Nezir Ayan and Yakup Uyar, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,800 (one thousand eight hundred euros) each in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros), jointly, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any taxes that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 5 December 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n15. Article 465 \u00a7 4 of the former Criminal Code provide as follows:\n\u201cIf the action does not cause any sickness or prevent the victim from attending his/her usual occupation (...) the offender shall be sentenced to 2 to 6 months' imprisonment or to a fine of TRL 200 to 2,500. However, the legal proceedings may be initiated only upon the victim's complaint.\u201d\n16. The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was in force at the time of the events, read as follows:\nArticle 302\n\u201cSave the exceptional circumstances described by law, the courts shall decide on objections filed against the penal orders without holding a hearing.\nIf the objection is upheld, the same court shall decide on the merits of the case.\u201d\nArticle 386\n\u201cThe judge at the magistrates' court may, without holding a hearing, rule on the offences which are within the jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Court and it may subsequently issue a penal order.\nOnly the sentencing to a fine, an imprisonment up to three months, a suspension of a certain profession and a seizure (...) may be adjudicated by a penal order. (...)\u201d\nArticle 387\n\u201cIf the judge at the magistrates' court considers that the lack of a hearing may put the offender in an unfavourable situation, then it could be decided to hold a hearing. \u201c\nArticle 388\n\u201cIn addition to the conviction, it should be noted in the penal order, the designation of the offence, the applicable provisions of law, the relevant evidence, and the possibility of raising an objection within eight days after its notification (...). The petition which raises an objection to the penal order shall be approved by the trial judge. (...)\u201d\nArticle 390\n\u201cA hearing shall be held if the objection is raised against an imprisonment sentence given by a penal order. (...)\nThe suspect can be represented by a defence counsel during the hearing. (...)\nThe objections against the penal orders (...) are examined by a judge at the criminal court of first instance, in line with the procedure described under Articles 301, 302 and 303. The objection would suspend the execution of the penal order.\u201d\n17. In a judgment given on 30 June 2004 the Constitutional Court declared Article 390 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure unconstitutional and a nullity. It held that lack of a hearing before the Criminal Court of First Instance that examines the objections to the penal order, would be in breach of the right to a fair hearing guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention, as well as Article 36 of the Constitution.\n18. Moreover, the new Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure which came into force on 1 June 2005, contain no provision concerning penal orders.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that he did not receive a fair and public hearing, in the determination of the criminal charge against him. He further complained that he was not informed promptly of the accusation against him, he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and that he was not allowed to defend himself in person or through a lawyer. He invoked Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a), (b) and (c) of the Convention:\n\u201c1. In the determination (...) of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing (...).\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; (...)\u201d\n20. The Government disputed these allegations. They contended that the penal order was issued by the Magistrate's Court in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This was a simplified procedure for minor crimes, aimed at diminishing the work load of the courts. Moreover they maintained that the Turkish law provided an option to object to penal orders.\n21. The Government further maintained that, following the coming into force of the new Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure the procedure of issuing of penal orders no longer exists in Turkish law.\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The general principles\n23. The Court reiterates that the public character of proceedings before the judicial bodies referred to in Article 6 \u00a7 1 protects litigants against the administration of justice in secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts can be maintained. By rendering the administration of justice visible, publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 \u00a7 1, namely a fair trial, the guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the meaning of the Convention (see, Sutter v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 February 1984, Series A no. 74, p. 12, \u00a7 26).\n24. It recalls that, read as a whole, Article 6 guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial. In general this includes not only the right to be present, but also the right to receive legal assistance, if necessary, and to follow the proceedings effectively. Such rights are implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c) and (e) of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (see, among other authorities, Stanford v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 282-A, pp. 10\u201311, \u00a7 26).\n25. The Court further notes that the provisions of paragraph 3 (a) of Article 6 point to the need for special attention to be paid to the notification of the \u201caccusation\u201d to the defendant. Particulars of the offence play a crucial role in the criminal process, in that it is from the moment of their service that the suspect is formally put on written notice of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him (Kamasinski v. Austria judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, pp. 36-37, \u00a7 79). Article 6 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the \u201ccause\u201d of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. That information should be detailed (P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 51, ECHR 1999-II; Dallos v. Hungary, no. 29082/95, \u00a7 47, 1 March 2001; Lakatos v. Hungary (dec.), no. 43659/98, 20 September 2001).\n##### 2. Application of these principles to the present case\n26. The Court considers that, in the instant case, it is more appropriate to deal with the applicant's complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 globally due to the overlapping nature of the issues and since the sub-paragraphs of Article 6 \u00a7 3 may be regarded as specific aspects of the general fairness guarantee of the first paragraph.\n27. At the outset, the Court notes that in a judgment given on 30 June 2004, the Constitutional Court unanimously declared Article 390 \u00a7 3 of the former Criminal Code unconstitutional and a nullity, holding that depriving individuals of a public hearing was in violation of the right to a fair trial. Furthermore, with the new Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure which came into force on 1 June 2005, the practice of issuing penal orders ceased to exist.\n28. It notes, however, that in accordance with the relevant domestic law prevailing at the time of the events, no public hearing was held during the applicant's prosecution. Both the \u0130zmir Magistrates' Court that sentenced the applicant to a pay a fine and the Izmir Criminal Court of First Instance that dismissed his objection, took their decision on the basis of the documents found in the case file. The Court, therefore, considers that the applicant was not able to follow the criminal proceedings effectively.\n29. Additionally, the indictment dated 3 July 2002 was not notified to the applicant, leaving him unaware of the factual and legal basis of the charges against him. The first time the applicant was informed of the charges against him was after the court had issued the penal order and sentenced him to pay a fine.\n30. In view of the above, the Court concludes that the procedure followed by the judicial authorities had prevented the applicant from exercising his defence rights properly and thus rendered the criminal proceedings unfair.\n31. It holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n33. The Court notes that the applicant did not submit any claim for just satisfaction within the time allowed.\n34. According to its settled case-law (see, most recently, Giniewski v. France, no. 64016/00, \u00a7 59, 31 January 2006), the Court does not make any award by way of just satisfaction where quantified claims and the relevant documentation have not been submitted within the time-limit fixed for that purpose by Rule 60 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n35. In those circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant has failed to comply with his obligations under Rule 60. As no valid claim for just satisfaction has been submitted, the Court considers that no award should be made in this respect.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention;\n3. Dismisses the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 15 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Bo\u0161tjan M.

Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nAlvina Gyulumyan,\nIneta Ziemele,\nLuis L\u00f3pez Guerra,\nAnn Power, judges,\nand Santiago Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 17 March 2009,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Unemployment benefits\n14. A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance. The main regulations in this area are given in the Unemployment Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets-f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, SFS 1997:238; hereafter \u201cthe 1997 Act\u201c) and the Unemployment Funds Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor, SFS 1997:239). Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and State funding. A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit, a so-called basic insurance. Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment, that is he or she has worked a certain number of months before becoming unemployed, and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions, for example, he or she must actively be looking for work. At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of days. After that, a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits.\n15. According to Section 45(a) of the 1997 Act, the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary, without acceptable reasons, rejects suitable work or if he or she, without having expressly rejected the work, by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised. The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits. According to Section 46, the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme (arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program). Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in the 1997 Act can be appealed against to the administrative courts.\n#### B. The activity guarantee scheme and activity support\n16. The activity guarantee scheme was one of several different labour market policy programmes. The scheme ceased to be in force on 2 July 2007. According to Sections 8 and 21 of the 2000 Ordinance, a person could (the word \u201cmay\u201d (f\u00e5r) was used in the Ordinance) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was at least 20 years old, was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service. Section 6 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and, thus, an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective. Moreover, Section 7 stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy.\n17. A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits. His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support (f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d, SFS 1996:100). Section 23 of the 1997 Act stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining days of unemployment benefits. In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining days of unemployment benefits, \u201csince the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 54).\n18. The Ordinance on Activity Support stated that a person who took part in, inter alia, the activity guarantee scheme was entitled to economic support. According to Section 5 of the Ordinance, a person who was or would have been entitled to unemployment benefits or who had received unemployment benefits for the longest period for which benefits could be provided, would be given activity support equivalent to the unemployment benefits he or she would have received under the 1997 Act. A person who was not entitled to benefits as described above would still be given a specific amount per day in activity support. When a person who had been taking part in a programme such as the activity guarantee ceased to be part of it, he or she was no longer entitled to the activity support.\n19. Section 37(a) of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would be revoked if a person assigned to it refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme without an acceptable reason. An assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would also be revoked if the individual did not act in a proper manner or otherwise disrupted the activities. Moreover, an assignment could be revoked if there were other special reasons to do so.\n20. According to Section 37(b) of the 2000 Ordinance, if an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked because the individual had refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, without an acceptable reason, the individual would (the word \u201cshall\u201d (skall) was used in the Ordinance) be reassigned to the activity guarantee scheme after a suspension of 45 days, if certain basic requirements were met. In the Government Bill which preceded the introduction of this provision, the Government noted that the consequences for those who had their assignment to the activity guarantee scheme revoked would be far-reaching unless they had fulfilled a new qualifying period of employment. The Government also observed that the activity guarantee scheme had the character of a last economic protection among the labour market policy measures for those who were, or were at a risk of becoming, unemployed for a long period. Thereafter the Government stated: \u201cThe person applying should therefore in principle have a right to participate in the activity guarantee until he or she finds a solution for his or her unemployment situation, on condition that he or she in an active way contributes to such a solution. ... A person who has had his or her assignment to the activity guarantee revoked on the ground that he or she has refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, shall therefore be offered a new assignment to the guarantee.\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 66)\n21. Decisions regarding the revocation of an assignment to a labour market policy programme, including the activity guarantee scheme, were taken by the County Labour Board. Appeals against the County Labour Board\u2019s decision could be made to the National Labour Market Board. According to Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance, no appeal lay against the National Labour Market Board\u2019s decisions.\n22. In connection with a reorganisation of the Labour Market Administration into the Employment Service, the issue of whether decisions regarding labour market policy programmes should be subject to appeal was considered by the Government. It first stated that there was a right to be assigned to the labour market policy measure called \u201cnew start jobs\u201d (nystartjobb) and then stated, inter alia, the following: \u201cIn the case of other labour market policy measures and financial compensation, assignment decisions to them depend to a great extent on the situation in the labour market. There is no right to receive such a measure and there is no right to retain it either. This means that the decisions to be taken by the new agency in these matters, including the revocation of a measure, do not need to be examined by a court. Nor are the decisions suited to an examination by a court.\u201d (Government Bill 2006/07:89 p 79)\n#### C. Appeals against an authority\u2019s decision\n23. The handling of matters in the Swedish public administration is regulated by the Administrative Procedure Act (f\u00f6rvaltningslagen, SFS 1986:223; hereafter \u201cthe 1986 Act\u201c). Section 3 \u00a7 1, of the 1986 Act states that the provisions in the Act are subsidiary if they differ from the provisions in any other act or ordinance. According to Section 22, a decision may be appealed against by any person whom the decision concerns, provided the decision affects him or her adversely and an appeal against the decision is permitted. Section 22(a) states that appeals are to be made to the administrative courts. The preparatory works (Government Bill 1997/98:101 pp 59 and 112) state that one of the purposes of Section 22(a) is to assign a competent court when a prohibition to appeal against a decision has to be set aside because it would be in violation of the Convention.\n24. On 1 July 2006 a new second paragraph was added to Section 3 of the 1986 Act which states that the provisions on appeal according to the Act should always apply if it is necessary in order to provide for everyone\u2019s right to a fair trial in the determination of their civil rights or obligations as laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. According to the preparatory works (Government Bill 2005/06:56 p 10), one of the reasons for amending the 1986 Act was to make it clear that the 1986 Act\u2019s provisions on appeal applied regardless of what was stated in other acts or provisions, if this was necessary in order to satisfy the right to access to court in accordance with the Convention.\n25. Section 21 \u00a7 2 of the 1986 Act states that an authority has an obligation to inform a party about how to appeal against all decisions that affect the party adversely, if the decision can be appealed against.\n26. In a decision of 22 November 1994 (NJA 1994 p. 657) the Swedish Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen) found that a dispute over agricultural subsidies concerned a civil right in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention and found that a trial before a court should be allowed. Therefore, the court set aside the prohibition to appeal against the authority\u2019s decision. Similarly, the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) has set aside prohibitions to appeal against different authorities\u2019 decisions, when the cases concerned civil rights and obligations (see, for example, decision of 25 November 1997 in R\u00c5 1997 ref. 65 and decision of 30 November 2001 in R\u00c5 2001 ref. 56).\n#### D. The State\u2019s liability to pay damages\n27. It follows from Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, SFS 1972:207) that the State is liable to pay compensation for, inter alia, financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority. From Chapter 3, Section 3 of the Act it follows that, under certain circumstances, the State is liable to pay compensation for financial loss caused by an erroneous instruction or advice given by an authority.\n28. In a judgment of 9 June 2005 (NJA 2005 p. 462), the Supreme Court found that an individual had a right to bring a civil action against the State before the national courts on the ground that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because a criminal case against the individual had not been concluded within a reasonable time. The Supreme Court has subsequently, in a judgment on 21 September 2007 (NJA 2007 p. 584), found that individuals have a right to bring civil suits against the State for violations against any Articles of the Convention when the State, according to the Convention, has an obligation to pay damages for the violation and such obligation cannot be based on national legislation.\n29. Anyone who wishes to claim compensation from the State for financial loss, which he or she considers to have been caused by a wrongful decision taken by a court or an administrative State authority, can proceed in two different ways: He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice in accordance with Section 3 of the Ordinance on the Administration of Claims for Damages against the State (F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten, SFS 1995:1301), or bring a civil action against the State in the ordinary courts. No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of Justice. However, if the claim is rejected, the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n30. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that she was not able to appeal against the decision by the Board, thereby being denied access to court. This provision provides in so far as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n(a) Parties\u2019 submissions\n31. The Government submitted that the complaint under Article 6 should be declared inadmissible as incompatible ratione materiae on the ground that the Board\u2019s decision did not involve a dispute over a \u201cright\u201d as understood by Article 6 of the Convention.\n32. Initially, the Government referred to Government Bill 2006/07:89, p. 79, where it was stated that decisions concerning labour market policy programmes other than \u201cnew start jobs\u201d were largely dependent on the labour market situation and that there was no right to be assigned to or be allowed to remain in a programme. Thus, they argued that the applicant could derive no right from the national legislation to be assigned to or allowed to remain in any labour market policy programme, including the activity guarantee scheme. This was so, according to the Government, due to the fact that the provisions governing the labour market policy programmes were worded in such a way that they did not lay down tangible eligibility criteria that could be examined without difficulty by the competent authorities and, upon appeal, by the national courts.\n33. The Government further submitted that several features of the relevant legal provisions, most notably the 2000 Ordinance, showed that there were no arguable grounds to claim a right to be assigned to a labour market policy programme. Referring to the wording of Section 8 of the 2000 Ordinance, which listed certain criteria for eligibility to be assigned to a labour market policy programme, the Government pointed out that the word \u201cmay\u201d had been used consciously by the Government in order to show that being assigned to a labour market policy programme or being allowed to remain in such a programme was not to be considered as a right. By using the word \u201cmay\u201d, the Government underlined that the sphere of labour market policy programmes should be governed by current labour market policy concerns which gave the authorities unfettered discretion to decide whether and to which individuals such programmes should be assigned.\n34. Furthermore, the Government argued that another pertinent feature of the provisions governing labour market policy programmes was the requirement laid down in Sections 6 and 7 of the 2000 Ordinance, which provided that an assignment to a programme had to be \u201cmotivated in terms of labour market policy\u201d. According to the Government, that criterion was laid down so that the authorities could refrain from assigning a person to a programme or cancel a person\u2019s assignment to the programme with reference to overall labour market policy. That policy criterion also demonstrated the unfettered discretion available for the authorities when deciding whether to assign a person to a programme. As a consequence, no attention whatsoever should be paid to a person\u2019s need or suitability for assignment to a programme if the individual\u2019s participation in the programme was not appropriate from an overall labour market policy perspective. It was, in other words, left entirely up to the authorities implementing the Government\u2019s labour market policies to decide whether a person should be assigned to or allowed to stay in a programme.\n35. The Government submitted that, should the Court find that the applicant could arguably derive a right to remain in the activity guarantee scheme from the national legislation at issue, it recognised that such a right must be considered to be a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n36. The applicant submitted that a distinction had to be made when examining the existence of a civil right in the domestic system between applications for rights not yet received and revocations of already existing rights. The primary issue in the instant case, according to the applicant, was not whether there was discretion in assigning a person to a labour market policy programme, but rather whether an authority had an absolute discretion to revoke a person\u2019s existing assignment to a programme.\n37. The applicant argued that the relevant provisions in the 2000 Ordinance, on which the decision to exclude the applicant from the activity guarantee scheme was based, were quite detailed and certainly contained tangible criteria. Therefore, the applicant argued, the authorities did not have unfettered powers to revoke her assignment to the activity guarantee scheme.\n38. The applicant also claimed that, while assignments to the programmes may be refused in the form of general measures, for instance for budgetary reasons, thus affecting a number of unidentified applicants seeking an assignment after a certain date or between certain dates, she disputed that a revocation of an already decided and ongoing assignment was permissible for budgetary reasons. The applicant further submitted that there had to be a clear distinction between general measures such as forming and shaping the programmes and setting budgets and so on, and the individual measures, such as revoking an assignment due to reasons connected with the individual\u2019s alleged behaviour and suitability.\n39. The applicant further stressed that the statements made in Government Bill 2006/07:89, p. 79 (see \u00a7 22 above), were made after the revocation of the applicant\u2019s assignment to the programme.\n40. Furthermore, the applicant argued that the word \u201cmay\u201d was used in many Swedish regulations whereby individuals could apply for various rights recognised under domestic law, if certain conditions were met. The mere use of the word \u201cmay\u201d did not, according to the applicant, normally mean that authorities had an unfettered discretion in granting or refusing to grant the right.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n41. The Court reiterates that, according to the principles laid down in its case-law, it must ascertain whether there was a dispute (\u201ccontestation\u201d) over a \u201cright\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not in itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) \u201crights and obligations\u201c in the substantive law of the Contracting States. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. Finally, the right must be civil in character (see, for example, Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011I).\n42. The Court first has to consider whether or not the right claimed by the applicant exists in Sweden. In this respect, it observes that the Convention does not grant a person a right to be assigned to or be allowed to stay in a labour market policy programme. It follows that the question of whether such a right can be said in any particular case to exist must be answered solely with reference to domestic law. In this connection, in deciding whether a right, civil or otherwise, could arguably be said to be recognised under Swedish law, the Court must have regard to the wording of the relevant legal provisions and to the way those provisions are interpreted by the domestic courts (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 327\u2011A).\n43. The Court reiterates that the existence of a margin of discretion on the part of the domestic authorities does not necessarily preclude the applicability of Article 6. If the subject of the court proceedings in question was a discretionary decision which interfered with the applicant\u2019s rights, the Court has held Article 6 to be applicable (see Pudas v. Sweden, 27 October 1987, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 125\u2011A and Mats Jacobsson v. Sweden, 28 June 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 180\u2011A).\n44. However, if the subject of the national proceedings was a discretionary decision as to whether the applicant was to receive certain benefits or was entitled to actions by the authorities, the Court has held that unfettered discretion or even a wide margin of discretion on the part of the domestic authorities indicated that no \u201cright\u201d to those benefits or actions is recognised under domestic law. As a consequence, Article 6 is not applicable to those proceedings (see Masson and van Zon, cited above, \u00a7 51; and Ankarcrona v. Sweden (dec.), no. 35178/97, ECHR 2000\u2011VI).\n45. The Court has furthermore specified that a \u201cright\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be related to certain tangible criteria, which can be examined without difficulties by the competent authorities, and upon appeal, by the national courts (see Ankarcrona, cited above).\n46. As regards the authorities\u2019 decisions to assign persons to the activity guarantee scheme, the Court notes that the relevant provisions were drafted with the word \u201cmay\u201d and that they also stated that an assignment had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy. Accordingly, it appears from the very terms of the legislation in issue that a \u201cright\u201d to be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme could not, on arguable grounds, be said to be recognised under national law.\n47. However, the Court also has to consider whether a person who had already been assigned to the activity guarantee scheme can be considered to have gained, on at least arguable grounds, a right not to have their assignment to the scheme arbitrarily revoked.\n48. Although the Court notes that Section 7 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy, the Court also observes that the applicant\u2019s assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was not revoked on grounds of labour market policy. It was revoked because the applicant had allegedly not acted in a proper manner in relation to the demands laid upon her, in accordance with Section 37(a) of the 2000 Ordinance.\n49. Section 37(a) of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme could be revoked if a person refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme without an acceptable reason, if he or she did not act in a proper manner or otherwise disrupted the activities, or if there were other special reasons to revoke the assignment.\n50. This section must, in the Court\u2019s view, be considered to have laid down tangible criteria, the existence of which could be examined without particular difficulties by the competent authorities and, subject to appeal, the national courts. The Court also considers that the relevant provision did not leave the domestic authorities unfettered discretion or even a wide margin of discretion.\n51. The Court further notes that an unemployed person collecting unemployment benefits could, according to Sections 45(a) and 46 of the 1997 Act, in practice, be forced to participate in the activity guarantee scheme. When that person entered the activity guarantee scheme, he or she would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits and would lose all remaining days of benefits. Thus, after leaving the activity guarantee scheme, he or she would not be able to go back to the said benefits until he or she had fulfilled a new qualifying period of employment. A person participating in the activity guarantee scheme would instead receive his or her subsistence in the form of activity support, which would be cancelled when his or her assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked.\n52. A revocation of the assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would therefore have serious economic consequences for the individual involved. This was one of the reasons given by the Government for introducing Section 37(b) of the 2000 Ordinance. Section 37(b) stated that if an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked because the individual had refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, the individual would be reassigned to the activity guarantee scheme after a suspension, if certain basic requirements were met. In the Government Bill preceding the introduction of Section 37(b), the Government expressed the opinion that a person in the activity guarantee scheme would in principle have a right to participate in the scheme until he or she found a solution to his or her unemployment (see above \u00a7 20).\n53. The Government also, in the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act, stated that the system around the activity guarantee scheme meant that no one should have to leave the scheme without having his or her support secured (see above \u00a7 17).\n54. In view of the above considerations, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s claim not to have her assignment to the activity guarantee scheme arbitrarily revoked did concern a \u201cright\u201d which could arguably be said to be recognised under Swedish law.\n55. In addition, the proceedings complained of were capable of leading - and did in the present case lead - to confirmation by the Board of the Employment Service\u2019s decision to revoke the applicant\u2019s participation in the activity guarantee scheme. They were therefore directly decisive for the right at issue.\n56. Therefore, and since it has not been disputed that the right must be considered a \u201ccivil\u201d right within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court concludes that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was applicable to the proceedings in this case.\n##### 2. Exhaustion of domestic remedies\n(a) Failure to claim compensation from the State\n57. The Government further submitted that, should the Court come to the conclusion that the complaints concerned a civil right according to the Convention, the complaints should be declared inadmissible due to failure to exhaust domestic remedies in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n58. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to her since she had not availed herself of the possibility to claim compensation from the State for the alleged violation of the Convention before the Chancellor of Justice and/or the domestic courts. They relied on two judgments of the Supreme Court, pronounced on 9 June 2005 and 21 September 2007 (see \u00a7 28 above). Thus, according to the Government, there was an effective remedy available to the applicant which she was obliged to exhaust before complaining to the Court.\n59. Referring to the Commission\u2019s case-law (Dello Preite v. Italy, no. 15488/89, Commission decision of 27 February 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR) 80-B, p. 22) the Government further argued that ignorance about law or jurisprudence was not a legitimate excuse for an applicant\u2019s failure to exhaust domestic remedies.\n60. The applicant submitted that the Government\u2019s argument that she should have brought a civil suit against the State for damages was completely contrary to the traditional division in Sweden between administrative and civil cases. She further submitted that there would be no prospect of success at all by such a remedy.\n61. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention - with which it has a close affinity - that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see, for example, Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, \u00a7 48, Series A no. 24).\n62. Furthermore the Court observes that, in the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies, there is a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was one which was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011IV).\n63. The Court notes that the first of the two judgments referred to by the Government concerned length of proceedings in a criminal case, whereas the present case concerns the lack of access to court in administrative proceedings. The second judgment referred to by the Government was pronounced on 21 September 2007, that is almost one year and three months after the applicant lodged the present application with the Court. Thus, at the time of introduction of the present application to the Court, there were no indications that a claim for compensation from the State for the lack of access to court could be an effective remedy in Sweden.\n64. Therefore, the applicant must be considered to have exhausted domestic remedies in this respect.\n(b) Failure to appeal against the Board\u2019s decision\n65. The Government further submitted that appeal prohibitions could be set aside, in accordance with the case-law of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court (see above \u00a7 26), if a decision that was excluded from appeal concerned a person\u2019s civil rights or obligations under Article 6 of the Convention. Therefore, if the applicant\u2019s complaint was considered to be a civil right, she would have had the right to have her case examined on the merits by a court of law, notwithstanding the appeal prohibition in Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance. Hence, the Government contended that the applicant should have submitted an appeal to the domestic courts. By not having done so, the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies.\n66. The applicant disagreed. In particular, she argued that the Swedish legal position concerning the possibility to appeal against administrative decisions, where there existed a domestic legal provision explicitly stating that the decision at issue was not subject to appeal, was not sufficiently clear. She further claimed that she had a legitimate expectation that the information given by the Board was correct, especially since a Government ordinance stated the same.\n67. The Court finds that the question of the effectiveness of this remedy and thus the issue of exhaustion are closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It should, therefore, be joined to the merits.\n(c) Conclusions\n68. The Court considers, in the light of the parties\u2019 submissions, that the applicant\u2019s complaint about lack of access to a court is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Parties\u2019 submissions\n69. The applicant complained that there had been a violation of her right of access to a court. She claimed that if there was indeed a possibility, as claimed by the Government, to appeal against the Board\u2019s decision, then she had been misled by the Board which had explicitly stated that its decision was not subject to appeal. In connection with this the applicant stressed the Board\u2019s obligation, according to Section 21, \u00a7 2 of the 1986 Act, to inform her of how to appeal against the decision since it had affected her adversely.\n70. The applicant also stressed that she was not represented by a legal representative before the national authorities since the general understanding was that legal representation was unnecessary in most administrative procedures and her legal costs would not therefore have been reimbursed, even if she had been successful in the procedure before the authorities. Thus, she submitted that it was normally not economically justifiable to engage a legal representative in such an administrative procedure.\n71. In sum, the applicant argued that the Swedish legal position concerning the possibility to appeal over administrative decisions, where there existed a domestic legal provision explicitly stating that the decision at issue was not subject to appeal, was not sufficiently clear. That fact alone, or at least taken in conjunction with the fact that she was explicitly informed that the decision was not subject to an appeal, in a procedure without legal representation, had the effect that the remedies argued by the Government were not sufficiently accessible and effective within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n72. The Government disagreed with these statements and submitted that the possibility to set aside an appeal prohibition, if the decision concerned a person\u2019s civil rights or obligations under Article 6 of the Convention, was firmly established in the case-law of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court at the relevant time. The Government further argued that the case-law cited by it, and its later codification, was adopted specifically for cases where an appeal prohibition might otherwise violate Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and also in order to ensure compliance with the Convention regardless of whether the Court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d had evolved since the legislation at issue was adopted.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n73. The Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his or her civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way it embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, Series A no. 18).\n74. Furthermore, the Court points out that the right of access to a court is not absolute and may be subject to legitimate restrictions. Where an individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the restriction will not be incompatible with Article 6 where the limitation does not impair the very essence of the right and where it pursues a legitimate aim, and there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, \u00a7 57, Series A no. 93).\n75. As concerns the present case, the Court considers that, at the relevant time, a right to appeal against decisions by national authorities that concerned a person\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d according to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, irrespective of any prohibitions against appeals in law or ordinance, could be found in the case law of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court (see above \u00a7 26).\n76. However, the Court will consider whether this right to appeal could, in the instant case, be considered as an effective access to a court.\n77. In this regard, the Court observes that the Board, in accordance with Section 21 \u00a7 2 of the 1986 Act, had an obligation to inform the applicant whether the decision could be appealed against and, if so, how to appeal. The Board left no appeal instructions. On the contrary, it expressly stated that the decision, in accordance with Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance, was not subject to appeal. Here, the Court notes that the 2000 Ordinance was the relevant national legislation in force regulating the activity guarantee scheme.\n78. The Court further observes that, at the relevant time, the above-mentioned amendment to Section 3 of the 1986 Act (see above \u00a7 24) had not yet been introduced.\n79. Furthermore, the Court stresses that, on 6 April 2006, the applicant in a letter to the Board expressed her dissatisfaction with the Board\u2019s decision and asked how she could obtain redress. However, the Board apparently did not reply to the letter or otherwise advise the applicant of her possibility to appeal against the decision.\n80. In view of the above considerations, and taking into account that the applicant was not represented by legal counsel, the Court concludes that the applicant should have been allowed to rely on the information given by the Board, and on Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance, that the Board\u2019s decision was not subject to appeal.\n81. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as to exhaustion of domestic remedies (see above \u00a7 66), previously joined to the merits (see above \u00a7 68) must be dismissed and that the applicant did not have a practical, effective right of access to court. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n82. The applicant also invoked Article 13 of the Convention, on the ground that she had no effective remedies in respect of her complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1. Article 13 reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n83. The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the complaint examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.\n84. Having regard to its decision concerning Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraphs 73-81 above), the Court takes the view that it does not have to examine the case under Article 13 as its requirements are less strict than, and are here absorbed by, those of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 69, Series A no. 171\u2011A; and Dragi\u010devi\u0107 v. Croatia, no. 11814/02, \u00a7 32, 9 December 2004).\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n85. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n86. The applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and SEK 90,000 (approximately EUR 8,400) in respect of pecuniary damage.\n87. The Government considered that any compensation for non-pecuniary damage should not exceed EUR 2,000. They contested the claim for pecuniary damage. The Government submitted that the applicant had not substantiated her claim and had not shown any causal link between the alleged violation of the Convention and any pecuniary damage.\n88. The Court considers that an award of just satisfaction must be based in the present case on the fact that the applicant did not have the benefit of the right of access to a court for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of a trial, in compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, would have been. The Court therefore does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged. Consequently, it rejects this claim. On the other hand, deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant EUR 2,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n89. The applicant also claimed SEK 27,000 (approximately EUR 2,520), exclusive of value-added tax (VAT), in legal fees for the proceedings before Court. This amount corresponded to a total of 15 hours of work for the applicant\u2019s counsel at an hourly rate of SEK 1,800.\n90. The Government did not question the number of hours indicated but considered the hourly rate charged to be excessive. They noted that SEK 1,081, exclusive of VAT, was the hourly rate currently applied under the Swedish legal aid system. The Government could accept a higher rate, but not exceeding SEK 1,200. Accordingly, should the Court find a violation, they would be prepared to pay a total of SEK 18,000 (approximately EUR 1,680), exclusive of VAT, in respect of legal costs.\n91. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 2,000 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n92. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to join to the merits the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and dismisses it;\n##### 2. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts which are to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of costs;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 April 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President", "001-78447": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF WOJTUNIK v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n21. The proceedings began on 1 December 1992 and ended on 28 January 1999. They therefore lasted 6 years, 1 month and 28 days. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect.\n22. The period under the Court\u2019s scrutiny lasted therefore 5 years, 8 months and 29 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n23. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that after 17 September 2004, when the 2004 Act had come into force, the applicant had the possibility of lodging with the Polish civil courts a claim for compensation for damage suffered on account of the excessive length of proceedings under Article 417 of the Civil Code read together with section 16 of the 2004 Act. They maintained that the three-year limitation period for the purposes of a compensation claim in tort based on the excessive length of proceedings could run from a date later than the date on which a final decision in these proceedings had been given.\n24. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n25. The Court observes that in the present case the proceedings at issue ended on 28 January 1999, which is more than three years before the relevant provisions of the 2004 Act read together with the Civil Code became effective. It follows that the limitation period for the State\u2019s liability for tort set out in Article 442 of the Civil Code had expired before 17 September 2004.\n26. The Court notes that the arguments raised by the Government are the same as those already examined and rejected by the Court in previous cases against Poland (see Ma\u0142asiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003; Ratajczyk v. Poland; (dec), 11215/02, 31 May 2005; Barszcz v. Poland, no. 71152/01, 30 May 2006) and the Government have not submitted any new elements which would lead the Court to depart from its previous findings.\n27. The Government further submitted that such a possibility had existed in Polish law even before the entry into force of the 2004 Act following the the Constitutional Court judgment of 4 December 2001, which took effect on 18 December 2001.\n28. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n29. The Court notes that it has already examined whether after 18 December 2001 and prior to the entry into force of the Law of 17 June 2004 a compensation claim in tort as provided for by Polish civil law was an effective remedy in respect of complaints about the length of proceedings. It held that no evidence of any judicial practice had been provided to show that a claim for compensation based on Article 417 of the Civil Code had ever been successful before the domestic courts (see Skawi\u0144ska v. Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003 and Malasiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, 14 October 2003). As the Government have failed to submit any new arguments which would cast doubt on its conclusions in these cases, the Court will abide by its previous findings.\n30. For these reasons, the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n32. The applicant complained about the length of the civil proceedings.\n33. The Government submitted that the case was very complex and difficult. In particular, the courts had to examine the nature of the activities performed by the applicant in three companies as well as the structural changes which had taken place within the business of the applicant\u2019s former employer.\n34. The Government further maintained that the interests of the applicant were of a purely pecuniary nature.\n35. The applicant did not comment on these issues.\n36. The Government were of the opinion that, as regards the conduct of the authorities, the courts had conducted the proceedings with due diligence and that there were no periods of inactivity by the courts. They further stated that \u201cspecial diligence\u201d was not required in this case, unlike the position in cases concerning employment and pensions.\n37. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments, stating that hearings had not been held at regular intervals and that the courts had not shown due diligence.\n38. The Government accepted that the applicant had not contributed to the length of the proceedings.\n39. The applicant did not comment on this issue.\n40. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII, Ku\u015bmierek v. Poland, no. 10675/02, 21 September 2004, \u00a7 62; Zynger v. Poland, no. 66096/01, 13 July 2004, \u00a7 45).\n41. In the Court\u2019s opinion the case was of average complexity and the applicant did not contribute to the length of the proceedings. The Court further observes that significant periods of unexplained inactivity attributable to the authorities occurred in this case. In particular, there were delays between 3 March 1993 and 27 August 1993 (5 months), between 26 October 1993 and 24 March 1994 (5 months), between 5 May 1994 and 20 December 1994 (7 months), between 18 March 1996 and 19 November 1996 (8 months) and between 24 February 1998 and 22 October 1998 (8 months). Furthermore, it took over two months (from 16 May 1995 to 27 July 1995) for the court to send a request to have witnesses examined by other courts.\n42. The Court reiterates that special diligence is necessary in employment disputes (Ruotolo v. Italy, judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no. 230-D, p. 39, \u00a7 17). The Court\u2019s case-law indicates that \u201cemployment disputes\u201d are not confined to those in which an applicant seeks reinstatement or a determination of his right to a pension. The notion of \u201cemployment disputes\u201d is broader and includes also other employment\u2011related issues, such as recognition of a right to a professional qualification (see, Caleffi v. Italy, judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 206\u2011B). In the present case the applicant sought compensation for refraining from undertaking any professional activities in competition with those of his former employer under the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d included in his contract of employment. The period during which the applicant was obliged to comply with the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d extended to six consecutive months after the termination of his contract of employment. Thus, the purpose of the \u201ccompetition clause\u201d was to provide the applicant with the means of subsistence in return for his renunciation of certain professional activities for quite a considerable time. Therefore, the Court finds that in the present case special diligence was required on the part of the authorities.\n43. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n44. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n45. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n46. The applicant claimed 91,000 PLN (23,000 EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n47. The Government contested the claim as exorbitant and ill-founded.\n48. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 1,200 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n49. The applicant did not submit any claims for costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n50. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,200 (one thousand two hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 December 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. Section 3(5)(a)0 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n17. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n18. A person who has been deported may apply to have the deportation order revoked. Paragraphs 390 to 392 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) provide that:\n\u201c390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will be considered in the light of all the circumstances including the following:\n(i) the grounds on which the order was made;\n(ii) any representations made in support of revocation;\n(iii) the interests of the community, including the maintenance of an effective immigration control;\n(iv) the interests of the applicant, including any compassionate circumstances.\n391. In the case of an applicant who has been deported following conviction for a criminal offence continued exclusion\n(i) in the case of a conviction which is capable of being spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, unless the conviction is spent within the meaning of that Act or, if the conviction is spent in less than 10 years, 10 years have elapsed since the making of the deportation order; or\n(ii) in the case of a conviction not capable of being spent under that Act, at any time, unless refusal to revoke the deportation order would be contrary to the Human Rights Convention or the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\nwill normally be the proper course. In other cases revocation of the order will not normally be authorised unless the situation has been materially altered, either by a change of circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh information coming to light which was not before, or the appellate authorities or the Secretary of State. The passage of time since the person was deported may also in itself amount to such a change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.\n392. Revocation of a deportation order does not entitle the person concerned to re\u2011enter the United Kingdom; it renders him eligible to apply for admission under the Immigration Rules. Application for revocation of the order may be made to the Entry Clearance Officer or direct to the Home Office.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant submitted that his deportation to Nigeria violated his right to respect for his family and private life under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties' submissions\n22. The applicant submitted that prior to his deportation he enjoyed family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention with his spouse, his three children and with his grandchild. He had co-habited with his spouse since 1980 and they have been married for twenty-two years. Their three children were born in the United Kingdom and have always lived in the family home. Even though the eldest child was an adult when the applicant was deported, he was not an independent person who had started his own family life. Rather, he was a student who still lived in the family home and who depended financially and emotionally on his parents. His daughter lived with him and prior to the applicant's deportation he relied on both of his parents to help him raise her while he pursued his studies. Following his deportation he relied solely on his mother.\n23. The applicant submitted that his deportation interfered with his right to respect for his family life because his family was split up without any prospect of being reunited in the near future. Relocation was not an option for the family because his teenage children were British nationals who were being educated in the United Kingdom. His eldest son had a child of his own in the United Kingdom. The applicant's wife could not relocate with the applicant because she had to stay to take care of the children and to help raise her grandchild. The only communication which the applicant had had with his family following his deportation was via telephone and written communication.\n24. The applicant accepted that the interference with his right to respect for his family and private life was in accordance with the law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. He argued, however, that it was not necessary in a democratic society. He relied on the official risk assessment report prepared by the Probation Service, which indicated that he posed a low risk of reoffending.\n25. The applicant further relied on the judgment of the Grand Chamber in \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, ECHR 2006\u2011XII. With regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence, he submitted that the only relevant offence was the one which the deportation order specifically held as the basis for the deportation, namely the sexual assault committed on 1 November 2005. As the Secretary of State for the Home Department was fully apprised of the applicant's previous offending and immigration history when he exercised his discretion to grant him Indefinite Leave to Remain in 2005, he could not now rely on his earlier offences in order to justify the decision to deport him. If considered in isolation, the applicant submitted that the sexual assault was not sufficiently serious to warrant deportation. In particular, he submitted that the sentence imposed for this offence, being less than two years, would not have resulted in a decision to deport under the policies in place at the time. This was reflected in the fact that the sentencing judge did not recommend deportation.\n26. The applicant indicated that prior to his deportation he had lived in the United Kingdom for twenty six consecutive years. He had not returned to Nigeria during that period, except for a three-week vacation in the summer of 2005. His residence in the United Kingdom was lawful between 1982 and 1986, and between 2005 and 2008. Between 1986 and 2000 he was attempting to regularise his stay and between 2000 and 2005 he was waiting for the outcome of his application under the Regularisation Scheme for Overstayers. While the applicant accepted that he had spent his formative years in Nigeria, he submitted that his ties to his home country were significantly weakened and by the date of his deportation he had vastly stronger ties to the United Kingdom.\n27. Three years passed between the applicant's last offence and his deportation. The applicant submitted that during that period he served his sentence and complied with the conditions of his licence. He engaged in offence-focussed work and his conduct was good, both in prison and upon release. He further indicated that between offences lengthy periods passed without transgression. In this respect the case could be distinguished from that of Joseph Grant v. the United Kingdom, no. 10606/07, 8 January 2009, where the applicant had no significant period of residence in the United Kingdom during which he did not offend.\n28. The applicant also contended that his wife would experience serious difficulties were she to follow him to Nigeria. She left Nigeria in 1983 and had been living in the United Kingdom ever since. Apart from her elderly mother she had no family or social ties in Nigeria. Relocation would separate her from her eldest child and from her grandchild and cause her significant distress. The teenage children would also face serious difficulties if they were to relocate to Nigeria. They had no links with Nigeria and could no longer be described as being \u201cof an adaptable age\u201d. Their personal and professional development would be severely hampered if they were to move to Nigeria and thus such a move could not be described as being \u201cin their best interests\u201d. Moreover, Nigeria was not a Member State of the Council of Europe and the living conditions there were unlike those in which the applicant's children had been brought up.\n29. The Government accepted that the applicant and his wife had a genuine, long-standing marriage and that family life existed between them. They further accepted that family life existed between the applicant and his two younger children, although they pointed out that they would come of age in October 2009 and September 2010 respectively. They contended, however, that no family life existed between the applicant and his eldest son as there was no evidence of dependency involving more than the normal emotional ties of father and adult son.\n30. The Government submitted that the applicant's deportation was a measure taken in accordance with the law and that any resulting interference with his right to respect for his family life under Article 8(1) of the Convention was proportionate in the interests of the prevention of crime.\n31. In relation to the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offence, the Government submitted that it was appropriate to have regard to the applicant's background of offending as well as to the offence which directly gave rise to the decision to make a deportation order. The applicant had been convicted of nine criminal offences during his time in the United Kingdom, including a number of offences of deception and dishonesty, which demonstrated a persistent disregard for United Kingdom law. The most serious offence warranted a sentence of four years' imprisonment and was described by the Court of Appeal as a significant conspiracy to defraud London clearing banks of in excess of GBP 60,000.\n32. In any case, the Government submitted that the offence committed by the applicant on 1 November 2005 was of itself a serious offence, warranting his registration as a sex offender for ten years in addition to a fifteen month term of imprisonment. Although the probation service recognised that the applicant's overall risk of re-conviction was low, the Government observed that he was assessed as presenting a medium risk of serious harm to known adults in the community. They therefore contended that they were entitled to regard a sexual offence involving the abuse of a position of trust as a serious matter and attach considerable weight to that factor.\n33. Although the Government recognised that the applicant had spent over twenty four years in the United Kingdom at the date of the decision to deport him, they submitted that he was an adult when he arrived and during his stay he served two periods of imprisonment. Moreover, for the majority of his stay his immigration status was precarious as he had been refused extensions to his leave as a student, he was refused asylum and he had been the subject of deportation action. Indeed, the offence which prompted the decision to make a deportation order was committed only six months after he was eventually granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.\n34. The Government further submitted that just over one year had elapsed from the commission of the sexual assault and the decision to make a deportation order. During that period the applicant was convicted of a further offence (failing to provide a specimen for analysis) and was disqualified from driving for three years.\n35. Finally, the Government contended that the applicant had put forward no evidence to demonstrate that he and his wife had developed strong social and/or cultural ties with the United Kingdom. Although it was accepted that the applicant was employed by a housing association at the time he committed the sexual assault, there was no other evidence to suggest that he or his wife were ever employed in the United Kingdom. The applicant's wife was a Nigerian citizen who had spent her formative years in Nigeria. Her mother still lived there and she had clearly maintained some ties with that country. The Government further contended that while the applicant's two younger children would face a degree of hardship in relocating to Nigeria, they were intelligent young people with no particular disabilities or needs and with the support of their parents they would be able to adjust to life in Nigeria. There was no evidence to suggest that it would be \u201cimpossible or exceptionally difficult\u201d for the applicant's wife and younger children to relocate with him (see Onur v. the United Kingdom, no. 27319/07, \u00a7 60, 17 February 2009). Alternatively, should the applicant's family decide to remain in the United Kingdom, they could maintain contact with the applicant by letter or telephone and visit him for holidays in Nigeria.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n(a) Was there an interference with the applicant's right to respect for his family and private life?\n36. The Government have accepted that the applicant's deportation interfered with his family life as reflected in his relationship with his wife and two youngest children. The Court endorses this view. Having regard to the concession made by the Government as to the existence of family life, it is unnecessary to decide whether the close bond which the applicant undoubtedly had with his eldest son and his granddaughter was itself sufficient to give rise to family life between them.\n37. The Court further recalls that, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8. Regardless of the existence or otherwise of a \u201cfamily life\u201d, the expulsion of a settled migrant therefore constitutes an interference with his or her right to respect for private life. It will depend on the circumstances of the particular case whether it is appropriate for the Court to focus on the \u201cfamily life\u201d rather than the \u201cprivate life\u201d aspect (see Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, ECHR 2008 \u00a7 63).\n38. In the instant case, the Court finds that the measures complained of interfered with both the applicant's \u201cprivate life\u201d and his \u201cfamily life\u201d. Such interference will be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention unless it can be justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 as being \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, as pursuing one or more of the legitimate aims listed therein, and as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve the aim or aims concerned.\n(b) \u201cIn accordance with the law\u201d\n39. It is not in dispute that the impugned measure had a basis in domestic law, namely section 3(5)(a)0 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999).\n(c) Legitimate aim\n40. It is also not in dispute that the interference served a legitimate aim, namely \u201cthe prevention of disorder and crime\u201d.\n(d) \u201cNecessary in a democratic society\u201d\n41. The principal issue to be determined is whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. The relevant criteria that the Court uses to assess whether an expulsion measure is necessary in a democratic society have recently been summarised as follows (see \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7\u00a7 57 - 58, ECHR 2006\u2011...):\n\u201c57. Even if Article 8 of the Convention does not therefore contain an absolute right for any category of alien not to be expelled, the Court's case\u2011law amply demonstrates that there are circumstances where the expulsion of an alien will give rise to a violation of that provision (see, for example, the judgments in Moustaquim v. Belgium, Beldjoudi v. France and Boultif v. Switzerland, [cited above]; see also Amrollahi v. Denmark, no. 56811/00, 11 July 2002; Y\u0131lmaz v. Germany, no. 52853/99, 17 April 2003; and Keles v. Germany, 32231/02, 27 October 2005). In the case of Boultif the Court elaborated the relevant criteria which it would use in order to assess whether an expulsion measure was necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. These criteria, as reproduced in paragraph 40 of the Chamber judgment in the present case, are the following:\n- the nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant;\n- the length of the applicant's stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled;\n- the time elapsed since the offence was committed and the applicant's conduct during that period;\n- the nationalities of the various persons concerned;\n- the applicant's family situation, such as the length of the marriage, and other factors expressing the effectiveness of a couple's family life;\n- whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time when he or she entered into a family relationship;\n- whether there are children of the marriage, and if so, their age; and\n- the seriousness of the difficulties which the spouse is likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled.\n58. The Court would wish to make explicit two criteria which may already be implicit in those identified in the Boultif judgment:\n- the best interests and well-being of the children, in particular the seriousness of the difficulties which any children of the applicant are likely to encounter in the country to which the applicant is to be expelled; and\n- the solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host country and with the country of destination.\u201d\n42. The Court observes that the applicant's most serious offences were committed in 1989 and 2005. During the sixteen years between these offences, the applicant largely stayed out of trouble (with the exception of a number of driving offences, none of which resulted in a prison sentence). The present case can therefore be distinguished from that of the previously cited case Joseph Grant v. the United Kingdom in a number of respects. First, the applicant in Grant was a habitual offender and there was no prolonged period during which he was out of prison and did not offend. This is clearly not the case for the present applicant. Secondly, Mr Grant committed all of his offences after he had been granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom. Moreover, deportation was considered at a relatively early stage and while the Secretary of State for the Home Department decided not to deport Mr Grant, it warned him that if in future he came to the adverse attention of the authorities, deportation would again be considered. In the present case the applicant was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain following his conviction for relatively serious crimes involving deception and dishonesty. The Court attaches considerable weight to the fact that the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who was fully aware of his offending history, granted the applicant Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom in 2005. Thirdly, the vast majority of the offences committed by Mr Grant were related to his drug use. There was therefore a history and pattern of offending that was unlikely to end until the underlying problem was addressed. In the present case, however, the applicant's offences were of a completely different nature and there was no indication that they were the result of any \u201cunderlying problem\u201d. In particular, there is no evidence of any pattern of sexual offending.\n43. Therefore, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that for the purposes of assessing whether the interference with the applicant's family and private life was necessary in a democratic society, the only relevant offences are those committed after the applicant was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.\n44. The Court reiterates that sexual assault is undoubtedly a serious offence, particularly where it also involves a breach of a position of trust. The Court observes, however, that the maximum available sentence for sexual assault was ten years' imprisonment. It is therefore clear that even taking into account the aggravating factor of a breach of a position of trust, the applicant's offence was not at the most serious end of the spectrum of sexual offences.\n45. The Court is mindful of the fact that the applicant has lived in the United Kingdom since 1982 and his wife has lived there since 1983. Although they both spent the formative years of their lives in Nigeria, their ties there have significantly weakened and they now have much stronger ties to the United Kingdom. While their residence in the United Kingdom was not always lawful, over the years they made numerous attempts to regularise their position and they were eventually granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in 2005. Their family life began in the United Kingdom before the applicant committed his first criminal offence and at a time when the applicant and his wife had leave to remain. Their children were born in the United Kingdom and are British citizens. Moreover, all three children have always lived in the family home and the family continued to live together as one unit until the applicant's deportation to Nigeria. The applicant's oldest son now has a daughter of his own and prior to his deportation the applicant and his wife were helping him to raise her while he pursued his studies.\n46. The Court attaches considerable weight to the solidity of the applicant's family ties in the United Kingdom and the difficulties that his family would face were they to return to Nigeria. The Court accepts that the applicant's wife was also an adult when she left Nigeria and it is therefore likely that she would be able to re-adjust to life there if she were to return to live with the applicant. She has, however, lived in the United Kingdom for twenty-six years and her ties to the United Kingdom are strong. Her two youngest children were born in the United Kingdom and have lived there their whole lives. They are not of an adaptable age and would likely encounter significant difficulties if they were to relocate to Nigeria. It would be virtually impossible for the oldest child to relocate to Nigeria as he has a young daughter who was born in the United Kingdom. Consequently, the applicant's wife has chosen to remain in the United Kingdom with her children and granddaughter. The applicant's family can, of course, continue to contact him by letter or telephone, and they may also visit him in Nigeria from time to time, but the disruption to their family life should not be underestimated. Although the Immigration Rules do not set a specific period after which revocation would be appropriate, it would appear that the latest the applicant would be able to apply to have the deportation order revoked would be ten years after his deportation.\n47. Finally, the Court turns to the conduct of the applicant following the commission of the offence on 1 November 2005. The applicant committed a driving offence during this period, having failed to provide a specimen for analysis. As a consequence, he was banned from driving for three years. The remainder of his conduct is difficult to assess as he spent most of the period from the conviction to his deportation in detention. His criminal sentence came to an end on 1 June 2007, after which he remained in immigration detention until he was granted bail on 25 June 2007. He was detained again on 14 September 2007 and remained in detention until he was deported on 27 April 2008.\n48. Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, in particular the strength of the applicant's family ties to the United Kingdom, his length of residence, and the difficulty that his youngest children would face if they were to relocate to Nigeria, the Court finds that the applicant's deportation was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n49. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 34 OF THE CONVENTION\n50. The applicant further submitted that the delay by the Probation Service in providing him with the risk-assessment report interfered with his right to effectively present his case before the Court. Article 34 provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.\u201d\n51. The Court has examined this complaint but finds, in the light of all the material in its possession and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, that it does not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols.\n52. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n53. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n54. The applicant claimed EUR 3,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage for the distress, anxiety and frustration caused by the deportation proceedings, the execution of the deportation order and the enforced separation from his wife, children and grandchild from 26 April 2008 onwards. The applicant further submitted that the Court should ensure that the Government exempted him from the fees associated with applying for his deportation order to be revoked, his application for entry clearance to return to the United Kingdom and the travel costs of his return from Nigeria to the United Kingdom. He also sought a resettlement allowance of EUR 500.\n55. The Government submitted that the sum sought in respect of a resettlement allowance was unprecedented before the Court and had not been quantified in any way. In the circumstances, the Government invited the Court not to make any award in this respect.\n56. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress and anxiety as a result of his deportation and separation form his family. Making an assessment on an equitable basis it awards the applicant EUR 3,000 under the head of non-pecuniary damage (see Mokrani v. France, no. 52206/99, 15 July 2003; Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, 23 June 2008; and Emre v. Switzerland, no. 42034/04, 22 May 2008) plus any tax that may be chargeable.\n57. The Court dismissed the applicant's other claims.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n58. The applicant claimed GBP 8,782.95 in respect of legal costs and expenses.\n59. The Government submitted that this sum was excessive. In particular, the Government submitted that as legal advice from the Aire Centre was provided on a pro bono basis, no costs or expenses had actually been incurred in this regard and thus no award should be made in respect of that advice. Moreover, the Government submitted that the total of ninety hours claimed by the applicant's lawyers was excessive by reference to the legal and factual context of the application.\n60. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 6,000 for the proceedings before this Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n61. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 6,000 (six thousand Euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into British Pounds at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 24 November 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Lech Garlicki\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-59853": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF DEVLIN v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 April and 9 October 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. By virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment.\n16. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act (as amended by the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989), a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n17. Section 42 of the 1976 Act (as amended) provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub-section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\n18. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended by the 1976 Act) provides as follows in section 19:\n\u201c(1) Subject to sub-section (4) below it shall be unlawful for a Minister of the Crown ... and any authority or body listed ... in ... Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 ... to discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate, in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. ...\n(4) This section does not apply to any act or omission which is unlawful by virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 or would be unlawful but for some exception made by virtue of Part V of that Act.\u201d\n19. Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 lists the departments and authorities subject to investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner. The list includes the Northern Ireland Civil Service Commission and all Government Departments, including the Department of Finance and Personnel. However, section 42 of the 1976 Act falls within Part V of that Act. Accordingly, where a section 42 certificate has been issued (claiming an act was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order), section 19(1) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended) has no effect.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant complained that he had been deprived of the right to have his claim under the Fair Employment Act determined by a court, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n21. The applicant submitted that the present case concerned the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in the job market, which right was as such a \u201ccivil\u201d right falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He was not claiming a right of access to the civil service but a right of equal treatment. There was a civil right at stake in the proceedings brought by him in the Fair Employment Tribunal and Article 6 was applicable.\n22. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they arose out of his unsuccessful application for a civil service post and therefore did not concern the determination of a \u201ccivil\u201d right. The Government quoted the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area which recognised the special status accorded in Contracting States to public servants and, in particular, their right to maintain the procedures necessary to ensure the integrity of those recruited into the civil service (see, amongst others, the Glasenapp v. Germany judgment of 28 August 1986, Series A no. 104; the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and the Commission\u2019s decision in Quinn v. the United Kingdom, no. 33694/96, 23 October 1997, unpublished). In the more recent case of Pellegrin v. France ([GC] no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999-II), disputes concerning posts involving the exercise of state authority were still excluded, and this applicant would have been working in a position of trust in a Department which wielded a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power. In their view, Tinnelly case (Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others, and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1633) was not relevant to the present case which concerned, in their view, a dispute about recruitment to the civil service which fell outside the scope of the Convention.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n23. The Court must determine whether Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable to the present case, in particular whether the claim submitted by the applicant before the Fair Employment Tribunal concerned the determination of a civil right. It recalls that in the Tinnelly case (cited above, pp. 1656-1657, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63) the Court considered that the 1976 Act, which was also invoked by the applicant in this case, guaranteed persons a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in the job market. That clearly defined right, having regard to the context in which it operated and to its pecuniary nature, was accordingly classified by the Court as a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. The Government have argued that this case should be distinguished from that of Tinnelly as it concerned, not disputes about works contracts, but access to the civil service to which special considerations have always attached. They have relied on previous precedents in not dissimilar cases, including the case of Quinn v. the United Kingdom decided by the Commission (no. 33694/96, decision of 23 October 1997). That case concerned the dismissal of an individual working in the Northern Ireland Passport Office and the subsequent issue of a section 42 certificate, denying him access to the Fair Employment Tribunal. The Commission held that Mr Quinn\u2019s application was inadmissible, following the Court\u2019s decision in Neigel v. France (judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports 1997-II) that the dispute between the applicant, a civil servant, and his State employer did not determine his \u201ccivil\u201d rights within the meaning of Article 6.\n25. However, the Court must now take into account its subsequent judgment in Pellegrin v. France (cited above), which reviewed the case-law concerning civil servants and sought to resolve the uncertainties which had arisen. That case laid down a new test to be applied in order to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to public servants. Under this test the only disputes excluded from Article 6 \u00a7 1 are those which are raised by public servants \u201cwhose duties typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter is acting as the depository of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities\u201d (see \u00a7 66). The Court referred to individuals in the public-service sector who \u201cwield a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power,\u201d as being those whose disputes are likely to fall outside the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n26. The Court is of the view that the post of administrative assistant (which is described as the lowest grade in the non-industrial Civil Service) is not a post where it can be said the incumbent was wielding \u201ca portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power\u201d. Even if such a postholder were part of a Department which did have such influence and could, potentially, apply for higher post, the Court does not find that an administrative assistant of this kind falls within the category of public servant described in the Pellegrin case. There is no reason to exclude the applicant\u2019s dispute from the ambit of Article 6 and the applicant can therefore claim, as in the Tinnelly case, that he had a \u201ccivil right\u201d under the 1976 Act not to be discriminated against in the employment sphere. Accordingly, Article 6 is applicable to the proceedings alleging discrimination which he brought under that Act.\n#### B. Compliance with Article 6 of the Convention\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n27. The applicant submitted that he had been denied access to court in the determination of his civil right, relying on the Tinnelly judgment (cited above) in which the Court found a breach of Article 6 due to the effect of a section 42 certificate in blocking proceedings in the Fair Employment Tribunal. In his view, section 42 of the 1976 Act did not operate to define the scope of the substantive right but provided the employer with a defence to a complaint of unlawful discrimination. The section 42 certificate, due to its conclusive nature, destroyed the very substance of the right of access to court. Further, the applicant argued that section 42, even taking account of the aim of protecting national security, represented a disproportionate interference with his right of access to a court.\n28. The Government denied that the applicant had been denied access to court. They contended that a certificate issued under section 42 of the 1976 Act negatived the existence of any civil right in cases of national security, public safety or public order. Even assuming therefore that Article 6 was applicable, the Government submitted that the Secretary of State\u2019s certificate under section 42 pursued a legitimate aim by proportionate means. Had the applicant been appointed to the post he would have had free access to buildings of the government department and to papers of a sensitive character. In the area of national security, they argued that a wide margin of appreciation should apply.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. The Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. The right is not however absolute. It may be subject to legitimate restrictions, for example, statutory limitation periods, security for costs orders, regulations concerning minors and persons of unsound mind (see the Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, pp. 1502-3, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52; the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 80-81, \u00a7\u00a7 62-67; the Golder judgment, cited above, p. 19, \u00a7 39). Where the individual\u2019s access is limited either by operation of law or in fact, the Court will examine whether the limitation imposed impaired the essence of the right and in particular whether it pursued a legitimate aim and there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, \u00a7 57). If the restriction is compatible with these principles, no violation of Article 6 will arise.\n30. In the present case, the Court notes that at no stage of the proceedings brought by the applicant was there any independent scrutiny of by the fact finding bodies set up under the 1976 and 1989 Acts of the facts which led the Secretary of State to issue the conclusive certificate under section 42 of the 1976 Act. No evidence as to why the applicant was considered a security risk was ever presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, nor was there any scrutiny of the factual basis of the Secretary of State\u2019s decision in the proceedings for judicial review brought in the High Court. In this regard, the present application is identical to the Tinnelly case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 72-79), where the Court considered that the conclusive nature of the section 42 certificate had the effect of preventing a judicial determination on the merits of the applicants\u2019 complaints, and that they were victims of unlawful discrimination.\n31. The Government have sought to justify any restriction on access to court by security considerations. As in the Tinnelly case therefore, it is necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the concerns for the protection of national security invoked by the authorities and the impact which the means they employed to this end had on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court or tribunal. The Court observes however that the Government have failed to identify any new elements which could lead it to depart from its conclusion in the Tinnelly case that the severity of the restriction imposed by the conclusive section 42 certificate, which was tantamount to removal of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction by executive ipse dixit, was not mitigated by other available mechanisms of complaints, and that the situation in Northern Ireland did not exclude the introduction of special judicial procedures more apt to provide the individual with procedural justice. It noted that \u201cthe introduction of a procedure, regardless of the framework used, which would allow an adjudicator or tribunal fully satisfying the Article 6 \u00a7 1 requirements of independence and impartiality to examine in complete cognisance of all relevant evidence, documentary or other, the merits of the submissions of both sides, may indeed serve to enhance public confidence\u201d (\u00a7 78).\n32. For these reasons, the Court finds in the present case that the issue by the Secretary of State of a section 42 certificate constituted a disproportionate restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court. There has, accordingly, been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. THE APPLICANT\u2019S REMAINING COMPLAINTS\n33. The applicant has also invoked Articles 8 (right to respect for private and family life), 9 (right to freedom of religion), 10 (freedom of expression), 13 (right to an effective remedy for a Convention breach) and 14 (prohibition of discrimination), claiming that breaches of these provisions are disclosed by the circumstances set out above (paragraphs 8\u201114 above).\n34. The Court notes that it has found a breach of Article 6 arising from the issue of the section 42 certificate which prevented the applicant\u2019s claims of unlawful discrimination being investigated by a body satisfying that provision\u2019s requirements. In the circumstances of this case and on the basis of the material before it, it does not consider it necessary to examine these complaints further.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n35. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n36. The applicant claimed that he had been denied a fair hearing of his complaint of unlawful discrimination and he was unable therefore to discover why he was unsuitable for appointment or correct any misapprehensions. He has suffered feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety, with strains on his family life because of his failure to obtain employment since the denial of the appointment in 1992. He requested that compensation be awarded to reflect the damage and hurt caused to him.\n37. The Government considered that the applicant had not substantiated any claim for either pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss and that any judgment in itself would constitute just satisfaction to the applicant.\n38. The Court notes that it is not possible to speculate as to what would have been the outcome of the proceedings brought by the applicant had the section 42 certificate not been issued. Nonetheless, the applicant was denied the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the merits of his claims that he was a victim of unlawful discrimination. In addition, he suffered non-pecuniary damage through feelings of frustration and injustice. The Court thus concludes that the applicant sustained some non-pecuniary damage which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention.\n39. Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant the sum 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n40. The applicant claimed a total of GBP 28,170.63, inclusive of value added tax (VAT), for legal costs and expenses, which included GBP 8078.13 for the work of junior counsel and GBP 20,092.50 for senior counsel. No claims were made for the work done by the legal staff of the Equality Commission on the applicant\u2019s behalf.\n41. The Government submitted that the sums claimed were grossly excessive, bearing in mind in particular that the case had not gone beyond the written stage. They disputed that it was necessary for both senior and junior counsel to have been engaged and considered that the claims did not sufficiently specify the hours or rates charged.\n42. The Court recalls that this case raised issues which were, to a large extent, identical to those considered in the Tinnelly case (cited above). Nor was this a case in which the Court requested assistance from the parties at any oral hearing or in which lengthy written submissions were submitted. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards the sum of GBP 12,000, inclusive of any VAT which may be chargeable.\n#### C. Default interest\n43. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that it is not necessary to examine further the complaints made under Articles 8, 9, 10, 13 or 14 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts:\n(i) 10,000 (ten thousand) pounds sterling in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) 12,000 (twelve thousand) pounds sterling in respect of costs and expenses, inclusive of any VAT which may be chargeable;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 7.5% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 30 October 2001, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

Nielsen, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 7 November 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. The situation of persons detained on remand was at the relevant time governed by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1969. Under Article 89, all correspondence of a detainee was to be opened, read and, if need be, subject to censorship, unless a prosecutor and a court decided otherwise. No provision of the Code provided for any remedy to contest the manner or scope of the censorship of a detainee\u2019s correspondence.\n13. The rights of persons detained on remand as regards their correspondence were further set out in Section 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand. They provided that the correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to screening by prison authorities and by authority conducting the criminal proceedings, i.e. either a public prosecutor or a court, depending on the stage reached in the proceedings.\n14. On 6 July 1997 a new Code of Enforcement of Criminal Sentences was enacted by parliament. Article 102 of this Code, which entered into force on 1 January 1998, provides that the convicted persons are entitled to uncensored correspondence with the State authorities and with the Ombudsman. Article 103 of the Code further provides that convicted persons and their lawyers may lodge complaints with the international agencies established under international treaties on protection of human rights, ratified by Poland. Prisoners\u2019 correspondence in such cases shall be dispatched with no delay and is not subject to censorship.\n15. Pursuant to Article 512 of the new Code, the rights of persons detained on remand shall, in principle, be the same as those of persons convicted by a final judgment.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that, while he was detained on remand, his correspondence with the organs of the European Convention of Human Rights had been intercepted, opened and read by the domestic authorities. He invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which in its relevant part reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his (...) correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n17. The Government submitted that the control over correspondence of detained persons was not in itself incompatible with the Convention. Polish law, namely the provisions of Rules of Detention on Remand, in particular their Section 33, as applicable at the material time, provided that correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to control by either the prosecuting authorities or by a court. Therefore the interference complained of was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.\n18. The Government further argued that there were no reasons to doubt that the control of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was carried out to ensure that it did not contain material which would be harmful to prison security or the safety of others or otherwise of a criminal nature. As to the letters from the organs of the European Convention of Human Rights, the control exercised by the court had had a purely technical character and had pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\n19. The applicant submitted that his correspondence with the Convention organs should not have been intercepted, opened and read by the domestic authorities.\n20. The Court first finds that the practice of opening and reading prisoners\u2019 letters amounts to an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for correspondence within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court also recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition guaranteed under Article 34 of the Convention that applicants or potential applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Convention organs without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see the Akdivar and Others and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV judgment, p. 1219, \u00a7 105; the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1192, \u00a7 159) The Court is well aware that no allegations of undue pressure have been made in the present case. However, it considers that it is of prime importance for the effective exercise of the right of individual petition under the Convention that the correspondence of prisoners with the Court is not subject to any form of control, which might potentially hinder them in bringing their cases to the Court.\n21. It must be examined whether the interference complained of satisfied the conditions set out in \u00a7 2 of Article 8. In particular, the measure at issue must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d which requires in particular that the contested measure should have a basis in domestic law. In this respect the Court notes that Section 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand, as applicable at the material time, provided that the correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to automatic screening by the detention centre. It was also to be read by the authority conducting the criminal proceedings (see \u00a7 13 above). Accordingly, there was legal basis for the interference complained of.\n22. However, the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d does not only necessitate compliance with domestic law, but also relates to the quality of that law. Domestic law must indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities so as to ensure to individuals the minimum degree of protection to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law in a democratic society (the, among other authorities, Domenichini v. Italy judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1800, \u00a7 33; Petra v. Romania, 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VII, p. 2853, \u00a7 36; cf. Di Giovine v. Italy, no. 39920/98, 26.7.2001, \u00a7 24).\n23. The Court observes that the applicable provisions of Polish law, as it stood at the material time, allowed for automatic opening and reading of prisoners\u2019 correspondence by prison authorities and by authorities conducting criminal proceedings. Thus, the applicable provisions did not draw any distinction between the different categories of persons with whom the prisoners could correspond. Neither were the authorities obliged to give a reasoned decision specifying the grounds on which it had been effected. Moreover, the relevant provisions had not laid down any principles governing the exercise of this control of correspondence. In particular, they failed to specify the manner and the time-frame within which it should be effected. Further, no provisions of law provided for a remedy enabling a detained person to contest the manner or scope of the application of that measure.\n24. In the light thereof, the Court found in a similar case, concerning the correspondence of a detained person with the Polish Ombudsman, that Polish law as it stood at the material time, did not indicate with reasonable clarity the scope and manner of exercise of discretion conferred on the public authorities in respect of control of prisoners\u2019 correspondence (Niedba\u0142a v. Poland, no. 27915/95, 4 July 2000). The Court sees no grounds on which to find otherwise in the present case. Accordingly, the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence did not satisfy the requirements of being \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.\n25. In the light of the foregoing, the Court does not consider it necessary in the instant case to examine whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were satisfied.\n26. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n28. The applicant requested PLN 250,000 of financial compensation.\n29. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s claims were grossly excessive and that the damage sustained by the applicant, if any, should be assessed in the light of the relevant case-law of the Court in its cases against Poland, and with regard to the national economic circumstances.\n30. The Court considers that the applicant sustained some non-pecuniary damage on account of the interference with his correspondence with the Convention organs, and awards him a sum of EUR 500.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicant did not seek to be reimbursed for any costs or expenses in connection with the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n32. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 28 November 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS\u00f8ren Nielsen Christos Rozakis\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-90967": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF NICOLA v.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 25 May 1992, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His son, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s son can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Loukas Nicola (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n16. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that since July 1974 Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n18. The Government disputed this claim.\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n19. The Government submitted that the property claimed by the applicant was situated outside the jurisdiction of Turkey and that the latter had no knowledge about it. In any event, the applicant had not produced any evidence supporting his claim to ownership. His house in Trypimeni village had not been occupied or used by the Turkish army. Moreover, the applicant had not applied through the proper channels to visit his alleged property. He had not even attempted to enter the northern part of Cyprus at an approved crossing point, and had not been prevented from doing so by Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces. He had been stopped on the southern side of the buffer zone by UNFICYP. The Turkish forces had not been involved in the incident.\n20. Finally, the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights could not be seen in isolation from the general political situation on the island of Cyprus and had been in any event justified in the general interest.\n##### 2. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that he had produced a photocopy of the original title deed of ownership of his house in Trypimeni. He relied on the principles laid down by the Court in the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment ((merits) of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI) and recalled that on 9 December 1990 he had been prevented from returning to his property.\n#### B. The third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n22. The Government of Cyprus observed that their department of Lands and Surveys had provided certificates confirming ownership to those persons who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title was entered in District Land Offices registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The authorities of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d) were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.\n23. The Government of Cyprus further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou ((merits), cited above), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n24. The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above) provide prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the property at issue. As the respondent Government failed to produce convincing evidence in rebuttal, the Court considers that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n25. The Court recalls that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64), it reasoned as follows:\n\u201c63. ... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy, her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.\n64. Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights which is imputable to Turkey.\nIt has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.\nNor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d\n26. In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (\u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189):\n\u201c187. The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cypriots to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n...\n189. .. there has been a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus are being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.\u201d\n27. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the conclusions which it reached in the Loizidou and Cyprus v. Turkey cases (op. cit.; see also Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, \u00a7 46, 31 July 2003).\n28. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that the applicant was denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of his property as well as any compensation for the interference with his property rights.\n### IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant submitted that in 1974 he had had his home in Trypimeni village. As he had been unable to return there until his death, he was the victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThis provision reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n30. The Government disputed this claim, observing that the applicant\u2019s inability to return to northern Cyprus had been an inevitable consequence of the political state of affairs on the island and of the existence of the UN buffer zone. The alleged interference with his rights under Article 8 had therefore been necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, for the prevention of disorder and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n31. The applicant submitted that, contrary to the applicant in the Loizidou case, he had been the owner of a house in Trypimeni village, and that until 1974 he and his family had been using these premises as their home. He claimed that any interference with his Article 8 rights had not been justified under the second paragraph of this provision.\n32. The Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon the applicant\u2019s statement that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, he was regularly residing in Trypimeni village and that this house was treated by the applicant and his family as a home.\n33. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the house of the applicant qualified as \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention at the time when the acts complained of took place.\n34. The Court observes that the present case differs from the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above) since, unlike Mrs Loizidou, the applicant actually had a home in Trypimeni village.\n35. The Court notes that from 1974 until his death the applicant was unable to gain access to and to use that home. In this connection the Court recalls that, in its judgment in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-175), it concluded that the complete denial of the right of Greek\u2011Cypriot displaced persons to respect for their homes in northern Cyprus since 1974 constituted a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\u201c172. The Court observes that the official policy of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities to deny the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes is reinforced by the very tight restrictions operated by the same authorities on visits to the north by Greek Cypriots living in the south. Accordingly, not only are displaced persons unable to apply to the authorities to reoccupy the homes which they left behind, they are physically prevented from even visiting them.\n173. The Court further notes that the situation impugned by the applicant Government has obtained since the events of 1974 in northern Cyprus. It would appear that it has never been reflected in \u2018legislation\u2019 and is enforced as a matter of policy in furtherance of a bi-zonal arrangement designed, it is claimed, to minimise the risk of conflict which the intermingling of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities in the north might engender. That bi-zonal arrangement is being pursued within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary-General ...\n174. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the complete denial of the right of displaced persons to respect for their homes has no basis in law within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 173 above); secondly, the inter-communal talks cannot be invoked in order to legitimate a violation of the Convention; thirdly, the violation at issue has endured as a matter of policy since 1974 and must be considered continuing.\n175. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention by reason of the refusal to allow the return of any Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to their homes in northern Cyprus.\u201d\n36. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the above reasoning and findings (see also Demades (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37).\n37. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of the complete denial of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home.\n### V. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF THE CONVENTION AND OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n38. The applicant complained of a violation of the general obligation to respect human rights enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention. He also complained of a violation under Article 14 of the Convention on account of discriminatory treatment against him in the enjoyment of his rights under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He alleged that this discrimination had been based on his national origin and religious beliefs.\nThe relevant provisions read as follows:\nArticle 1 of the Convention\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.\u201d\nArticle 14 of the Convention\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n39. The Government disputed these claims.\n40. The Court recalls that in the Alexandrou case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39) it has found that it was not necessary to carry out a separate examination of the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention. The Court does not see any reason to depart from that approach in the present case (see also, mutatis mutandis, Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios v. Turkey, no.16163/90, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 31 July 2003). Moreover, the Court has found the respondent Government to be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 8 of the Convention and does not consider it necessary to examine the complaint under Article 1, which is a framework provision that cannot be breached on its own (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 238, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, and Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n### VI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n41. The applicant submitted that he had not had at his disposal any effective remedy by which to obtain redress for the above-mentioned grievances.\nHe relied on Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n42. The Government disputed this claim, observing that the \u201ceffective remedy\u201d mentioned in Article 13 necessarily referred to a remedy in the domestic law of the \u201cTRNC\u201d. Turkey could neither interfere with the judicial system of the \u201cTRNC\u201d nor provide remedies to supplement those existing under domestic law. In the light of the above, no issue under Article 13 could be raised by the present application.\n43. The Court notes that the applicant submitted no pleadings on this point, including on the issue of applicability. It considers therefore that it is not necessary to examine this complaint (see Demades (merits), cited above, \u00a7 48).\n### VII. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n45. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, the applicant\u2019s son requested 23,000 Cypriot pounds (CYP \u2013 approximately 39,297 euros (EUR)) for pecuniary damage. He relied on an expert\u2019s report assessing the value of his losses which included the loss of annual rent collected or expected to be collected from renting out the property, plus interest from the date on which such rents were due until the day of payment. The rent claimed was for the period dating back to January 1987, when the respondent Government accepted the right of individual petition, until September 1999. The applicant\u2019s son did not claim compensation for any purported expropriation since he was still the legal owner of the properties. The valuation report contained a description of Trypimeni village.\n46. The starting point of the valuation report was the rental value of the applicant\u2019s property in 1974 (CYP 408 \u2013 approximately EUR 697), calculated a percentage (5%) of the market value of the house (CYP 8,750 \u2013 approximately EUR 14,950). This sum was subsequently adjusted upwards or downwards according to the annual increase or decrease, in order to arrive at the annual rent receivable in 1987 (CYP 770 \u2013 approximately EUR 1,315). The expert took into account the nature of the area under study and the trends in rent increase (an average of 5% per annum, and, from 2002 onwards, of 8% per annum). Compound interest for delayed payment was applied at a rate of 8% per annum.\n47. On 26 January 2008, following a request from the Court for an update on developments in the case, the applicant\u2019s son submitted updated claims for just satisfaction, which were meant to cover the period of loss of use of the property from 2000 to 31 December 2007. He produced a revised valuation report which, on the basis of the criteria adopted in the previous report, concluded that the sum due for the loss of use for this last period was CYP 35,000 (approximately EUR 59,801) including legal interests. The total sum claimed by the applicant\u2019s for pecuniary damage thus amounted to CYP 58,000 (approximately EUR 99,098).\n48. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, the applicant\u2019s son further claimed CYP 120,000 (approximately EUR 205,032) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He stated that this sum had been calculated on the basis of the sum awarded by the Court in the Loizidou case ((just satisfaction), 28 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV), taking into account, however, that the period of time for which the damage was claimed in the instant case was longer and that there had also been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n49. Finally, in his updated claims for just satisfaction of 26 January 2008, the applicant\u2019s son requested CYP 73,846 (approximately EUR 126,173) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n(b) The Government\n50. The Government filed comments on the applicant\u2019s son\u2019s updated claims for just satisfaction on 30 June 2008 and 15 October 2008. They pointed out that the present application was part of a cluster of similar cases raising a number of problematic issues and maintained that the claims for just satisfaction were not ready for examination. The Government had in fact encountered serious problems in identifying the properties and their present owners. The information provided by the applicants in this regard was not based on reliable evidence. Moreover, owing to the lapse of time since the lodging of the applications, new situations might have arisen: the properties could have been transferred, donated or inherited within the legal system of southern Cyprus. These facts would not have been known to the respondent Government and could be certified only by the Greek Cypriot authorities, who, since 1974, had reconstructed the registers and records of all properties in northern Cyprus. Applicants should be required to provide search certificates issued by the Department of Lands and Surveys of the Republic of Cyprus. Moreover, in cases where the original applicant had passed away or the property had changed hands, questions might arise as to whether the new owners had a legal interest in the property and whether they were entitled to pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary damages.\n51. The Government further noted that some applicants had shared properties and that it had not been proved that their co-owners had agreed to the partition of the possessions. Nor, when claiming damages based on the assumption that the properties had been rented after 1974, had the applicants shown that the rights of the said co-owners under domestic law had been respected.\n52. The Government further submitted that as an annual increase of the value of the properties had been applied, it would be unfair to add compound interest for delayed payment, and that Turkey had recognised the jurisdiction of the Court on 21 January 1990, and not in January 1987. In any event, the alleged 1974 market value of the properties was exorbitant, highly excessive and speculative; it was not based on any real data with which to make a comparison and made insufficient allowance for the volatility of the property market and its susceptibility to influences both domestic and international. The report submitted by the applicant\u2019s son had instead proceeded on the assumption that the property market would have continued to flourish with sustained growth during the whole period under consideration.\n53. The Government produced a valuation report prepared by the Turkish-Cypriot authorities, which they considered to be based on a \u201crealistic assessment of the 1974 market values, having regard to the relevant land records and comparative sales in the areas where the properties [were] situated\u201d. This report contained two proposals, assessing, respectively, the sum due for the loss of use of the property and its present value. The second proposal was made in order to give the applicant\u2019s son the option to sell the property to the State, thereby relinquishing title to and claims in respect of it.\n54. The report prepared by the Turkish-Cypriot authorities specified that it would be possible to envisage, either immediately or after the resolution of the Cyprus problem, restitution of the applicant\u2019s property. Alternatively, the latter could give entitlement to financial compensation, to be calculated on the basis of the loss of income (by applying a 5% rent on the 1974 market values) and increase in value of the property between 1974 and the date of payment. Had the applicant\u2019s son applied to the Immovable Property Commission, the latter would have offered CYP 8,618.37 (approximately EUR 14,725) to compensate the loss of use and CYP 9,179.73 (approximately EUR 15,684) for the value of the property. According to an expert appointed by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities, the 1974 open-market value of the applicant\u2019s property was CYP 1,500 (approximately EUR 2,563). Upon fulfilment of certain conditions, the Immovable Property Commission could also have offered the applicant\u2019s son exchange of his property with Turkish-Cypriot properties located in the south of the island.\n55. Finally, the Government did not comment on the applicant\u2019s submissions under the head of non-pecuniary damage.\n##### 2. The third-party intervener\n56. The Government of Cyprus fully supported the applicant\u2019s updated claims for just satisfaction.\n##### 3. The Court\u2019s assessment\n57. The Court first notes that the Government\u2019s submission that doubts might arise as to the applicant\u2019s title of ownership over the property at issue (see paragraph 50 above) is, in substance, an objection of incompatibility ratione materiae with the provisions of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an objection should have been raised before the application was declared admissible or, at the latest, in the context of the parties\u2019 observations on the merits. In any event, the Court cannot but confirm its finding that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see paragraph 24 above).\n58. In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage is not ready for decision. It observes, in particular, that the parties have failed to provide reliable and objective data pertaining to the prices of land and real estate in Cyprus at the date of the Turkish intervention. This failure renders it difficult for the Court to assess whether the estimate furnished by the applicant\u2019s son of the 1974 market value of his properties is reasonable. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant\u2019s son (Rule 75 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n59. In his just satisfaction claims of 29 September 1999, relying on bills from his representative, the applicant\u2019s son sought CYP 1,825 (approximately EUR 3,118) and 1,240 British Pounds (\u00a3 - approximately EUR 1,570) for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. This sum included CYP 500 (approximately 854 EUR) for the cost of the expert report assessing the value of the properties. In his updated claims for just satisfaction of 26 January 2008, the applicant\u2019s son submitted additional bills of costs for the new valuation report and for legal fees amounting to CYP 1,000 (approximately EUR 1,708). The total sum claimed for costs and expenses was thus EUR 6,396.\n60. The Government did not comment on this point.\n61. In the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of costs and expenses is not ready for decision. The question must accordingly be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed with due regard to any agreement which might be reached between the respondent Government and the applicant\u2019s son.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds unanimously that the applicant\u2019s son has standing to continue the present proceedings in his stead;\n##### 2. Dismisses by six votes to one the Government\u2019s preliminary objections;\n3. Holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1;\n4. Holds by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n5. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine whether there has been a violation of Articles 1, 13 and 14 of the Convention;\n6. Holds unanimously that the question of the application of Article 41 is not ready for decision;\naccordingly,\n(a) reserves the said question in whole;\n(b) invites the Government and the applicant\u2019s son to submit, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement that they may reach;\n(c) reserves the further procedure and delegates to the President of the Chamber the power to fix the same if need be.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 27 January 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Nicolas Bratza\nDeputy Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the dissenting opinion of Judge Karaka\u015f is annexed to this judgment.\nN.B.\n#### F.A.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE KARAKA\u015e\n(Translation)\nUnlike the majority, I consider that the objection of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies raised by the Government should not have been rejected. Consequently, I cannot agree with the finding of violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThe rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies is intended to give Contracting States the opportunity to prevent or provide redress for violations alleged against them before such allegations are referred to the Court. That reflects the subsidiary nature of the Convention system.\nFaced with the scale of the problem of deprivations of title to property alleged by Greek Cypriots (approximately 1,400 applications of this type lodged against Turkey), the Court, in the operative part of its Xenides\u2011Arestis v. Turkey judgment of 22 December 2005, required the respondent State to provide a remedy guaranteeing the effective protection of the rights set forth in Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the context of all the similar cases pending before it. The State has a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, but also to select the general or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and to redress so far as possible the effects. The Government submitted that by enacting the Law on Compensation for Immovable Properties (Law no. 67/2005) and setting up a Commission to deal with compensation claims it had discharged that obligation (see also Xenides\u2011Arestis v. Turkey (just satisfaction), no. 46347/99, \u00a7 37, 7 December 2006). It is that domestic remedy which, in their submission, the applicant failed to exercise in the present case.\nThe exhaustion of domestic remedies is normally assessed at the time when an application is lodged with the Court. However, there are exceptions to the rule which may be justified by the particular circumstances of each case (see Baumann v. France, no. 33592/96, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-V (extracts)).\nExamples of such exceptions are to be found in the cases against Italy which raised similar questions and in which the Court found that certain specific facts justified departing from the general principle (see Brusco v. Italy, (dec.) no. 69789/01, ECHR 2001-IX).\nIn other examples the Court also took the view, in the light of the specific facts of the cases concerned, and having regard to the subsidiary nature of the Convention mechanism, that new domestic remedies had not been exhausted (see the following decisions: Nogolica v. Croatia, no. 77784/01, ECHR 2002-VIII; Slavi\u010dek v. Croatia, no. 20862/02, ECHR 2002-VII; Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v. Slovakia, nos. 57984/00, 60226/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00 and 68563/01, ECHR 2002-IX; and I\u00e7yer v. Turkey, no. 18888/02, ECHR 2006-I).\nIn situations where there is no effective remedy affording the opportunity to complain of alleged violations, individuals are systematically compelled to submit to the European Court of Human Rights applications which could have been investigated first of all within the domestic legal order. In that way, the functioning of the Convention system risks losing its effectiveness in the long term (the most pertinent example is the Broniowski v. Poland case ([GC], no. 31443/96, ECHR 2004-V).\nIn my opinion the above examples provide an opportunity to review the conditions for admissibility in the event of a major change in the circumstances of the case. For the similar post-Loizidou cases, the Court can always reconsider its admissibility decision and examine the preliminary objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies.\nSince the Court may reject \u201cat any stage of the proceedings\u201d (Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention) an application which it considers inadmissible, new facts brought to its attention may lead it, even when examining the case on the merits, to reconsider the decision in which the application was declared admissible and ultimately declare it inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, taking due account of the context (see, for example, Medeanu v. Romania (dec.), no. 29958/96, 8 April 2003, and Azinas v. Cyprus [GC], no. 56679/00, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43, ECHR 2004-III).\nThe existence of a \u201cnew fact\u201d which has come to light after the admissibility decision may prompt the Court to reconsider that decision.\nI consider that the Law on Compensation for Immovable Properties (Law no. 67/2005) and the Commission set up to deal with compensation claims, which are based on the guiding principles laid down by the Court in the Xenides-Arestis case, are capable of providing an opportunity for the State authorities to provide redress for breaches of the Convention\u2019s provisions, including breaches alleged in applications already lodged with the Court before the Act\u2019s entry into force (see I\u00e7yer, cited above, \u00a7 72). That consideration also applies to applications already declared admissible by the Court (see Azinas, cited above).\nIn order to conclude whether there has or has not been a breach of the Convention, complainants must first exercise the new domestic remedy and then, if necessary, lodge an application with the European Court of Human Rights, the international court. Following that logic, I cannot in this case find any violation of the Convention\u2019s provisions.", "001-87466": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF FIGIEL v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII, and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. On 30 July 2007 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 10,000 (the equivalent of EUR 2,600) in respect of the two cases introduced by the applicant (see paragraphs 4 and 9 above). The Government invited the Court to strike out the applications in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n12. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. He maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n13. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n14. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof. The Court will have regard in this connection to the compatibility of the amount with its own awards in similar length of proceedings cases, bearing in mind the principles which it has developed for determining victim status and for assessing the amount of non-pecuniary compensation to be awarded where it has found a breach of the reasonable-time requirement (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 85\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011...,; Scordino v. Italy (no.1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 193-215, ECHR-2006-...; and Dubjakova v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 10 October 2004).\n15. It is to be noted that the amount proposed by the Government in their unilateral declaration refers to two separate cases brought by the applicant, one of which is the subject of the present proceedings.\n16. While the amount proposed might be considered sufficient in a single case, it cannot be accepted as adequate just satisfaction for a breach of the reasonable-time requirement in two separate cases. On the facts and for the reasons set out above, in particular the amount of compensation proposed, the Court finds that the Government have failed to provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require it to continue its examination of the case (see, a contrario, Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z o.o. WAZA v. Poland (striking out), no. 11602/02, 26 June 2007).\n17. This being so, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of its list of cases under Article 37 of the Convention and will accordingly pursue its examination of the admissibility and merits of the case.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government refrained from submitting observations on the admissibility and merits of the complaint.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 25 October 1999 and ended on 27 October 2004. It thus lasted 5 years and 4 days for one level of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. In the present case the Regional Court acknowledged a breach of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time but refrained from making an award of just satisfaction (see paragraph 8 above). Having regard to the criteria for determining victim status in respect of length of proceedings complaints as set out in the above-mentioned Scordino (no. 1) judgment, the Court concludes that the complaint cannot be rejected as being incompatible ratione personae with the Convention.\nIt further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n22. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n23. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n24. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. Regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations that his complaint about a breach of his right to a trial within a reasonable time was not effective, the Court considered it appropriate to raise of its own motion the issue of Poland\u2019s compliance with the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention on account of indications that the applicant had no effective domestic remedy in respect of the protracted length of proceedings in his case. Article 13 reads:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n26. The Government refrained from making any comments in this respect.\n27. The Court reiterates that Article 13 guarantees an effective remedy before a national authority for an alleged breach of the requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hear a case within a reasonable time. However, the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of a \u201cremedy\u201d within the meaning of that provision does not depend on the certainty of a favourable outcome for the applicant (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 154 et seq., ECHR 2000-XI, \u00a7\u00a7 156-157).\n28. While the subsidiarity principle underlying the Convention system requires the Contracting States to introduce a mechanism addressing complaints about the excessive length of proceedings within the national legal system, they are afforded \u2013 subject to compliance with the requirements of the Convention \u2013 some discretion as to the manner in which they provide individuals with the relief required by Article 13 and conform to their Convention obligation under that provision. In particular, where the State has introduced a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave to it a wide margin of appreciation and allow it to organise the remedy \u2013 including the interpretation and application of the notion of \u201cdamage\u201d in a given case \u2013 in a manner consistent with its own legal system, traditions and the standard of living in the country concerned (see Kud\u0142a ibid.; and Scordino (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 188-189).\n29. The fact that in the present case the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction failed and that the redress obtained from the domestic court was not sufficient for Convention purposes does not in itself render the remedy under the 2004 Act incompatible with Article 13, albeit that it has consequences for the Court\u2019s assessment of his victim status in respect of the alleged breach of the reasonable-time requirement (see paragraph 20 above, with references to the Court\u2019s case-law, and, mutatis mutandis, Zarb v. Malta, no. 16631/04, \u00a7\u00a7 49-52, 4 July 2006).\nAs stated above, the expression \u201ceffective remedy\u201d used in Article 13 cannot be interpreted as a remedy bound to succeed, but simply an accessible remedy before an authority competent to examine the merits of a complaint (see paragraph 25 above; and, also, \u0160idlov\u00e1 v. Slovakia, no. 50224/99, \u00a7 77, 26 September 2006).\nIn the light of the foregoing, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case it cannot be said that the applicant\u2019s right to an effective remedy under Article 13 of the Convention has not been respected.\n30. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n32. The applicant claimed 3,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n33. The Government did not express an opinion on the matter.\n34. The Court considers that it should award the full sum claimed.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n35. The applicant also claimed EUR 150 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n36. The Government did not express an opinion on the matter.\n37. The Court awards the full sum claimed.\n#### C. Default interest\n38. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of the list;\n2. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4.. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted in the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(ii) EUR 150 (one hundred and fifty euros) in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 17 July 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-94421": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ERKU\u015e v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. Article 72 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Law on Military Service stipulate that every male citizen of the Republic of Turkey shall fulfil his military service.\n16. Pursuant to section 80 \u00a7 1 of the Law on Military Service, those who have deserted their headquarters or who have exceeded their period of leave or medical leave shall be searched for, arrested and placed in the custody of the local military authorities in order to be handed over to their army commands.\n17. Section 66 of the Military Criminal Code is entitled \u201cdesertion\u201d. Paragraph 1 (b) of this provision makes it a criminal offence to exceed one\u2019s period of leave by six days without authorisation.\n18. Under section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure applicable at the time of the events, the period a person can spend in custody shall not exceed forty-eight hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court. Under section 80 \u00a7 5, if the arrestee cannot be brought before a military court within the time-limit specified in section 80 \u00a7 3, he or she shall be taken to the nearest magistrates\u2019 court. No one shall be deprived of his or her liberty beyond this time-limit.\n19. On 29 June 2006 section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure was amended by Law no. 5530, which provided that time in custody shall not exceed twenty-four hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court, and that the time necessary for transfer could not be more than twelve hours.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that his detention had been unlawful and excessively long and that the authorities had failed to initiate an investigation into the matter. He relied on Articles 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 and 13 of the Convention.\n22. The Court considers that these complaints should be examined solely from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (b), (c) and 3, which provide as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...\n(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non- compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\n3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n23. The Government maintained that the applicant had not been deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. In this connection, they submitted that he had been kept under surveillance in the Izmir Military Recruitment Office for the sole purpose of ensuring his transfer back to his army command and that he was not subjected to any proceedings or investigation until he was taken to his military unit. They further claimed that this administrative measure had been taken to prevent his escape, since he was a deserter, and that he had immediately been sent to his unit upon the completion of necessary procedures such as the provision of a vehicle, personnel, travel expenses and monetary matters concerning his transfer. Moreover, the Government claimed that the applicant had actually been in military service during that time. The Government admitted that the applicant had been held in custody between 7 and 11 March 2003 for the proper administration of military discipline. They submitted that he had been brought before a judge on the very day the Military Prosecutor filed an indictment.\n24. The applicant maintained that he had been held in custody from 22 February 2003 until 11 March 2003, first in Izmir and afterwards in K\u0131rklareli. He further disputed the qualification given by the Government to his detention, noting that it had deprived him of his liberty and restricted his rights to see his lawyer and family. He claimed that the conditions of his detention had been inhuman as he had been threatened, beaten and given food only once a day. Finally, the applicant repeated that, despite the unlawfulness of his detention, the authorities had failed to investigate the matter.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Whether there was deprivation of applicant\u2019s liberty\n25. The Court observes that there is no dispute between the parties as regards the applicant\u2019s detention between 7 March and 11 March 2003 in K\u0131rklareli. However, the Government argued that the applicant was not deprived of his liberty between 22 February 2003 and 7 March 2003 in Izmir.\n26. The Court reiterates that military service, as encountered in the Contracting States, does not of itself constitute a deprivation of liberty under the Convention, since it is expressly sanctioned in Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b). In addition, rather wide limitations upon the freedom of movement of members of the armed forces ensue by reason of the specific demands of military service, so that the normal restrictions accompanying it do not come within the ambit of Article 5 either (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 22). However, the forms of restriction which clearly deviate from the normal conditions of life in the armed forces of the Contracting States fall within the scope of Article 5. In order to establish whether this is so, account should be taken of a whole range of factors such as the nature, duration, effects and manner of execution of the penalty or measure in question (ibid).\n27. In the instant case, the Court observes that on 22 February 2003 the applicant was detained in custody at the \u015eirinyer Military Station Command. Between 23 February 2003 and 6 March 2003 the applicant was kept in a \u201csecurity room\u201d at the Izmir Military Recruitment Office. The Court further observes that these periods were subsequently deducted from the applicant\u2019s prison sentence (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, the Government have not provided any explanation or details as regards what security or other measures were applicable to the applicant and, apart from the statement that he was in military service, no evidence has been adduced to demonstrate that he remained, more or less, within the ordinary framework of his army life during that time. In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant was also deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention when he was held in Izmir between 22 February 2003 and 6 March 2003.\n##### 2. Whether the deprivation in issue was \u201clawful\u201d\n28. The Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention contains a list of permissible grounds of deprivation of liberty which is exhaustive. The applicability of one ground does not necessarily preclude that of another; a detention may, depending on the circumstances, be justified under more than one sub-paragraph (see, for example, Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VI). However, only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see, inter alia, Giulia Manzoni v. Italy, 1 July 1997, \u00a7 25, Reports 1997\u2011IV).\n29. The Court reiterates that any deprivation of liberty must, in addition to falling within one of the exceptions set out in sub-paragraphs (a)-(f), be \u201clawful\u201d and comply with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d. By the use of these terms the Convention essentially refers back to national law and an obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 \u00a7 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness (see, for example, Elci and Others v. Turkey, nos. 23145/93 and 25091/94, \u00a7 667, 13 November 2003). It is a fundamental principle that no detention which is arbitrary can be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 and the notion of \u201carbitrariness\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 extends beyond a lack of conformity with national law, so that a deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary and thus contrary to the Convention (see, for example, Saadi v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13229/03, \u00a7\u00a7 68\u201171, ECHR 2008\u2011... and the cases referred to therein). In particular, to avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (b) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention should be appropriate; and the length of the detention should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see, mutatis mutandis, A. and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05, \u00a7 164, 19 February 2009, and, mutatis mutandis, Saadi, cited above, \u00a7 74).\n30. In the instant case, the Government have not expressly relied on any ground under the sub-paragraphs of Article 5 \u00a7 1 to justify the applicant\u2019s detention. The applicant did not express any opinion either.\n31. Having regard to the documentary evidence submitted by the parties, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention, when he was held in Izmir, served two different purposes. On the one hand, it had the purpose of ensuring his return to his army command in order to secure the fulfilment of his obligation, prescribed by law, to perform compulsory military service pursuant to section 80 \u00a7 1 of Law on Military Service. On the other hand, it also had the purpose of bringing him before a competent authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed the offence of exceeding his leave. On this latter point, the Court observes that section 66 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Military Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence to exceed one\u2019s period of leave by six days without authorisation. It further observes that the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being an army deserter and was questioned within a few hours of his arrest about the reasons for his desertion (see paragraph 6 above). Moreover, he was subsequently transferred to his army command in K\u0131rklareli, where he was once again questioned about his desertion. The applicant\u2019s detention thereafter thus served the purpose of bringing him before a competent authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence. In this connection, the Court notes that he was subsequently brought before a judge, who remanded him in custody. In sum, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s detention between 22 February 2003 and 6 March 2003 in Izmir falls to be examined under both sub-paragraph (b) and (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1, whereas his detention in K\u0131rklareli falls to be examined under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 \u00a7 1.\n32. However, although the applicant was detained on the basis of section 80 \u00a7 1 of the Military Service Law and section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure, the Court has serious doubts whether the authorities acted in compliance with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201d. Nevertheless, it does not deem it necessary to determine this question because, in any event, the key issue to be examined is whether the applicant\u2019s detention was free from arbitrariness. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant was deprived of his liberty between 22 February and 11 March 2003 for seventeen days. The Court finds no reason to doubt that the national authorities acted in good faith in detaining the applicant in conformity with the purpose of the restrictions permitted by the relevant sub-paragraph of Article 5 \u00a7 1. In this connection, it takes particular note of the Government\u2019s arguments regarding the necessity of securing the necessary material provisions for the applicant\u2019s transfer. However, in the absence of any concrete information or documentation, the Court does not find it convincing that, in order to achieve the aim sought by the applicant\u2019s detention, the authorities needed twelve days to send the applicant to his army unit or that it was necessary to detain him for a total of seventeen days before he could be brought before a judge. Moreover, the Court attaches importance to the fact that no information has been forthcoming from the Government to clarify the place and conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention and the security or other measures which were applicable to him throughout his lengthy detention.\n33. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1.\n34. The Court does not consider it necessary to examine separately the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in view of its foregoing finding that his detention was not \u201clawful\u201d under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (see, mutatis mutandis, Emrullah Karag\u00f6z v. Turkey, no. 78027/01, \u00a7 63, ECHR 2005\u2011X).\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n35. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n36. The applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n37. The Government contested the amount.\n38. The Court, ruling on an equitable basis, awards the applicant EUR 6,500 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n39. The applicant also claimed reimbursement of his costs and expenses incurred both before the domestic courts and before the Court. These concerned 4,000 Turkish liras (approximately EUR 2,015) for legal fees, 5.50 (approximately EUR 2.50) Turkish liras for postage and EUR 30 for photocopies and other expenses. The applicant submitted documentation as regards his costs and expenses before the Court.\n40. The Government contested the amounts.\n41. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,503 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n42. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine separately the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 6,500 (six thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,503 (one thousand five hundred and three euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 29 September 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-82750": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PI\u0104TKIEWICZ v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 September 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS FOR PAYMENT\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings for payment had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 May 1991. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 16 December 1999. It thus lasted 6 years, 7 months and 17 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government raised a preliminary objection that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies available to him under Polish law, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that from 17 September 2004, the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act, the applicant had a possibility of seeking compensation for damage resulting from the excessive length of proceedings before the Polish courts, under section 16 of the 2004 Act read in conjunction with Article 417 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the applicant had lodged such a civil claim which had been examined on the merits at two instances and is pending before the Supreme Court.\n22. The applicant contested that argument and submitted that he had exhausted all available domestic remedies. In addition he argued that a claim for compensation under Article 417 of the Civil Code was not an effective remedy; nevertheless, he had attempted to make use of it, to no avail.\n23. The Court has already examined whether after 18 December 2001 and prior to the entry into force of the 2004 Act a compensation claim in tort as provided for by Polish civil law was an effective remedy in respect of complaints about the length of proceedings. It held that no persuasive arguments had been adduced to show that Article 417 of the Civil Code could at that time be relied on for the purpose of seeking compensation for excessive length of proceedings or that such action offered reasonable prospects of success (see Skawi\u0144ska v Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003, and Malasiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003). Subsequently, and following the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Court has held that the civil action relied on by the Government cannot be regarded as an effective remedy with a sufficient degree of certainty in cases where the three-year limitation period for the State's liability in tort expired before the entry into force of the 2004 Act on 17 September 2004 (see Ratajczyk v. Poland, cited above; and Barszcz v. Poland, no. 71152/01, \u00a7 45, 30 May 2006, Drabicki v. Poland, no. 15464/02, \u00a7 17, 14 November 2006).\nThe present case belongs to this group of applications as the proceedings at issue ended on 16 December 1999, which is more than three years before the 2004 Act came into force. The Court reiterates that the only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. In view of the above findings, and since the applicant's attempt to obtain redress at the national level by making use of a remedy that is not regarded by the Court as effective in similar cases, the Court considers that the Government's plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non\u2011exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n24. The Government further submitted that the applicant had withheld information from the Court as he had failed to inform it that he had lodged civil proceedings for compensation under Article 417 of the Civil Code. Thus, his application to the Court constituted an abuse of the right of individual application under Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n25. The applicant did not comment on the Government's objection.\n26. The Court observes that the applicant in his letter of 15 November 2004 did inform the Registry of the Court about his intention to make use of the remedies introduced by the 2004 Act. In view of this, and given the general nature of the Government's argument, the Court finds no grounds whatsoever for concluding that the applicant's application to the Court is an abuse of the right of individual application.\n27. The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). The Court reiterates that special diligence is necessary in employment disputes (Ruotolo v. Italy, judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no. 230\u2011D, p. 39, \u00a7 17).\n29. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n30. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. In particular, the Court notes that no hearing was held during a 10-month period between April 1994 and February 1995 as well as during a period of 18 months when the case was with the Supreme Court. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS FOR PAYMENT\n31. The applicant first complained that the proceedings in his case were unfair. In particular, he alleged errors of fact and law committed by the courts, which, moreover, had incorrectly assessed the evidence. He alleged a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n32. However, the Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-I, with further references).\n33. In the present case the applicant did not allege any particular failure to respect his right to a fair hearing on the part of the relevant courts. Indeed, his complaints are limited to a challenge to the result of the proceedings. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court finds no indication that the impugned proceedings were conducted unfairly.\nIt follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION IN RESPECT OF THE PROCEEDINGS FOR REINSTATEMENT\n34. Lastly, the applicant complained about unfairness and the unreasonable length of the proceedings for reinstatement.\n35. However, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention:\n\u201c1. The Court may only deal with the matter ... within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken...\u201d\n36. The Court notes that the proceedings in question ended with the Supreme Court's judgment of 27 February 2002, thus more than six months before 30 March 2003, the date on which this complaint was submitted to the Court.\nIt follows that this part of the application has been introduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n38. The applicant claimed almost 200,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in respect of pecuniary damage and PLN 3,795,792 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n39. The Government contested the claims and considered them irrelevant and exorbitant.\n40. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant 2,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n41. The applicant also claimed PLN 2,125 for the costs and expenses incurred before both the domestic courts and the Court.\n42. The Government contested the claims and submitted that only costs actually incurred by the applicant before the Court should be taken into consideration.\n43. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was not represented before the Court by a lawyer, the sum of EUR 100 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n44. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the civil proceedings for payment admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 100 (one hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 16 October 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002), Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey (no. 53431/99, \u00a7\u00a7 11-12, 23 October 2003) and G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey ([GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-V).\n19. By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Journal on 30 June 2004, the State Security Courts have been abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n1. As regards the independence and impartiality of the Istanbul State Security Court\n21. The applicants complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that they had been denied a fair hearing on account of a military judge on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court which had tried and convicted them.\nThe relevant parts of Article 6 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n22. The Government submitted that there was no basis to find that the applicants could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Istanbul State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 18 June 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34; \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35\u201136, 6 February 2003; and Han v. Turkey, no. 50997/99, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 13 September 2005).\n24. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicants, who were prosecuted in a State Security Court for aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, they could legitimately fear that the Istanbul State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicants' fear as to the State Security Court's lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV, \u00a7 72).\n25. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. As regards the other complaints submitted under Article 6 of the Convention\n26. The applicants maintained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the search in the HADEP Gaziosmanpa\u015fa office had not been conducted in accordance with law and since their conviction by the State Security Court had been based on the evidence found there, they did not have a fair trial. The applicants complained under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention that the submissions of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court on the merits of the case and the written opinion of the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had been never served on them, thus depriving them of the opportunity to put forward their counter-arguments.\n27. Having regard to its above finding that the applicants' right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicants' remaining complaints under Article 6 of the Convention (see, among many others, Incal, cited above, \u00a7 74; and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f and Others v. Turkey, no. 40303/98, \u00a7 24, 15 March 2005).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicants claimed a total of 36,000 euros (EUR) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n30. The Government contested the applicants' claims.\n31. Regarding the question of pecuniary damage, the Court considers in the first place that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the State Security Court might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred (see Tezcan Uzunhasano\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 35070/97, \u00a7 27, 20 April 2004). Moreover, the applicants' claim in respect of pecuniary damage has not been substantiated by any evidence whatsoever. It therefore makes no award under this head.\n32. With regard to non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicants (see \u0130ncal, cited above, \u00a7 82).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n33. The applicants also claimed EUR 27,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n34. The Government submitted that the claims were excessive and unsubstantiated.\n35. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum(see Sawicka v. Poland, no. 37645/97, \u00a7 54, 1 October 2002). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicants, jointly, the global sum of EUR 1,000 under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n36. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint concerning the independence and impartiality of the Istanbul State Security Court;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the applicants' other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicants;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, jointly, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses plus any tax that may be chargeable to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of the settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 15 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Bo\u0161tjan M.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 4 August 2006.\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the censorship of correspondence is stated in the Court\u2019s in the cases of Matwiejczuk v. Poland, no 37641/97, 2 December 2003, and Drozdowski v. Poland, no. 20841/02, 6 December 2005.\n#### B. Relevant statistical data\n18. In the framework of the procedure before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below) the Polish Government supplied statistical data concerning the number and the length of pre-trial detentions ordered in the years 2005-2006 by the domestic courts. A more detailed rendition of the relevant statistical data can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, \u00a7 28, 3 February 2009).\n### III. MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION\n#### A. Recent amendments to the relevant legislation\n19. A number of amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), designed to streamline criminal proceedings, entered into force on 20 June 2007 (Law of 9 May 2007 on amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure; Journal of Laws of 2007, No. 99, item 664; Ustawa o zmianie ustawy - Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw). Those amendments strengthened the powers of the authorities to discipline the parties. A more detailed rendition of the recent amendments to the legislation can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 30-31).\n#### B. Other measures\n20. According to the information supplied by the Polish Government to the Committee of Ministers (see paragraph 23 below), in addition the Polish trial courts and prosecution authorities have undertaken a series of practical measures in order to organise criminal proceedings in a more efficient manner, i.e. by scheduling time-limits for hearings well in advance, holding hearings on Saturdays or severing charges against co-accused to separate proceedings under Article 34 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the joint examination proves difficult and time-consuming.\n21. On 17 May 2007 the Cabinet (Rada Ministr\u00f3w) adopted the \u201cPlan of Actions of the Government for the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland\u201d (Program Dzia\u0142a\u0144 Rzqdu w sprawie wykonywania wyrok\u00f3w Europejskiego Trybuna\u0142u Praw Cz\u0142owieka). By virtue of that document the Minister of Justice was obliged to disseminate among judges and prosecutors on a regular basis information on the standards concerning the length of pre-trial detention stemming from the Convention and the case-law of the Court in Polish cases and to include this topic in the programmes of workshops and seminars for judges.\n### IV. RELEVANT COUNCIL OF EUROPE DOCUMENTS\n#### A. The Committee of Ministers\n22. On 6 June 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted an Interim Resolution concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in 44 cases against Poland relating to the excessive length of detention on remand (\u201cthe 2007 Resolution\u201d). It concluded that the number of the Court\u2019s judgments finding Poland in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on account of the length of pre-trial detention revealed a structural problem. A more detailed rendition of the 2007 Resolution can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7 34)\n#### B. The Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights\n23. On 20 June 2007 the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights released the Memorandum to the Polish Government concerning, among other issues, the use of the pre-trial detention in Poland. The Commissioner referred to the fact that the Court had repeatedly found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of Poland and stressed that examples of cases brought to the Court where pre-trial detention had lasted between 4 to 6 years were not uncommon. The Commissioner urged the Polish authorities to review the application and functioning of pre-trial detention in Polish law. A more detailed rendition of the relevant parts of the memorandum can be found in the above-mentioned Kauczor judgment (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 35).\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n24. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died after the introduction of his application. Subsequently, his mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application introduced by her son. She explained that her son had lived with her in her apartment until his death. She had taken care of him since he had suffered from nervous depression after his stay in detention facilities. She also supported him financially as he had lost his job, home and wife after his arrest. She submitted that her son had needed continual care until his death. Therefore, she had suffered frustration and distress caused, in particular, by her son\u2019s almost three\u2011year\u2011long detention on remand and its consequences.\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s mother cannot be considered a person entitled to pursue the proceedings before the Court on the applicant\u2019s behalf and invited the Court to strike the application out of its list of cases.\n26. The Court recalls that when an applicant dies during the proceedings, the next\u2011of\u2011kin of the applicant has a legitimate interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case (see, for example, Lukanov v. Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011II, \u00a7 35; Fojcik v. Poland, no. 57670/00, \u00a7 46, 21 September 2004; X v. France, 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234-C, p. 89, \u00a7 26 and Kozimor v. Poland, no. 10816/02, \u00a7\u00a7 25-29, 12 April 2007).\n27. The Court thus accepts that the applicant\u2019s mother has a legitimate moral interest to pursue the application on his son\u2019s behalf and to obtain a ruling whether, in particular, the length of his detention and alleged censorship of his correspondence had infringed his Convention rights, complaints which he relied on before the Court.\n28. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s mother has standing to continue the proceedings before the Court in the applicant\u2019s stead, and the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should be dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that the length of his detention on remand had been excessive. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n30. The Government contested that argument.\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n31. The applicant\u2019s detention started on 12 September 2001, when he was arrested on suspicion of murder. On 22 March 2002 the S\u0142upsk Regional Court convicted him of murder as charged.\nAs from that date he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and, consequently, that period of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (cf. Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 104).\nOn 5 September 2002 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction. Following that date his detention was again covered by Article 5 \u00a7 3. It continued until 16 September 2003 when the applicant was again convicted. On 10 February 2004 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal again quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction. Following that date his detention was again covered by Article 5 \u00a7 3. It continued until 7 February 2005 when the applicant was again convicted.\n32. Accordingly, the period to be taken into consideration amounts to two years, six months and seventeen days.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) General principles\n33. The Court recalls that the general principles regarding the right \u201cto trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial, as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention were stated in a number of its previous judgments (see, among many other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110 et seq, ECHR 2000\u2011XI; and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7\u00a7 41-44, ECHR 2006-..., with further references).\n(b) Application of the above principles in the present case\n34. In their detention decisions the authorities relied principally on two grounds, namely on the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the severity of the penalty to which he was liable.\n35. The Court accepts that the reasonable suspicion against the applicant of having committed a serious offence could initially warrant his detention.\n36. However, with the passage of time, those grounds became less and less relevant. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds adduced by the courts \u2013 namely, the severity of the anticipated sentence \u2013 was \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d (see, Kud\u0142a cited above, \u00a7 111).\n37. According to the authorities, the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant created a presumption that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings. However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).\n38. Having regard to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant lasted almost four years and that the case was heard three times by the first-instance court, it is questionable whether those grounds could be considered \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d throughout the entire period and whether the authorities showed the necessary diligence in dealing with the case (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000\u2011IV).\n39. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the grounds given by the domestic authorities could not justify the overall period of the applicant\u2019s detention. In these circumstances it is not necessary to examine whether the proceedings were conducted with special diligence.\nThere has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. The Court considered it appropriate to raise ex officio the issue of Poland\u2019s compliance with Article 8 of the Convention on account of the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court.\nThis Article, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his ... correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\nThe Government\u2019s plea of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\n41. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all available domestic remedies. They alleged that he had failed to bring an action under Articles 24 and 23 in conjunction with Article 448 of the Civil Code. These provisions would have allowed the applicant to assert that by censoring his correspondence the authorities had breached his personal rights protected by the Civil Code and to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n42. In this connection, the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006 in which a prisoner had been awarded 5,000 Polish zlotys in damages from the State Treasury for a breach of the confidentiality of his correspondence with the Central Board of the Prison Service and the Central Electoral Office. The Regional Court had held that the confidentiality of one\u2019s correspondence was one of the personal rights protected under Article 23 of the Civil Code and that in the event of its breach a claimant could be entitled to an award for non-pecuniary damage.\n43. The Government also relied on the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 2 April 2009 in which a prisoner had been awarded 4,420 Polish zlotys in damages from the State Treasury for a breach of the confidentiality of his correspondence with his lawyer by the prosecutors of the Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski.\n44. The Court notes that the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence occurred in 2002, whereas the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006 and on the Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 2 April 2009. Any relevance that the latter judgments might possibly have in respect of the present case is therefore reduced by the fact that that they were given after the relevant time and the latter one after the applicant\u2019s death (see, for example, V. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24888/94, \u00a7 57, ECHR 1999\u2011IX).\n45. It follows that the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n46. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n47. The Court recalls that any \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the right to respect for correspondence will contravene Article 8 of the Convention unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article and is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve them (see, among many other authorities, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 32, \u00a7 84; Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 16, \u00a7 34 and Niedba\u0142a v. Poland no. 27915/95, \u00a7 78).\n48. As to the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, the Court has established three fundamental principles. The first one is that the interference in question must have some basis in domestic law. The second principle is that \u201cthe law must be adequately accessible\u201d, a person must be able to have an indication that is adequate, in the circumstances, of the legal rules applicable to his case. The third principle is that \u201ca norm cannot be regarded as a \u2018law\u2019 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable a person to regulate his conduct; he must be able \u2011 if need be with appropriate advice \u2011 to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail\u201d (see Silver, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 86-88).\n49. It is important to respect the confidentiality of correspondence with the Court since it may concern allegations against prison authorities or prison officials. The opening of letters both to and from the Convention organs undoubtedly gives rise to the possibility that they will be read and may conceivably, on occasion, also create the risk of reprisals by prison staff against the prisoner concerned (see Campbell, cited above, p. 22, \u00a7 62). No compelling reasons have been found to exist for monitoring or delaying an applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court (see Campbell, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 48 and 62; and Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, \u00a7 84, ECHR 2001\u2011III and Drozdowski v. Poland, no. 20841/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-31, 6 December 2005).\n##### 2. Application of the principles to the circumstances of the present case\n(a) Existence of an interference\n50. On 5 March 2003 the Court received a letter from the applicant dated 9 February 2003. The envelope bore the following stamps: \u201cthe S\u0142upsk Regional Court (...)\u201d and \u201cCensored on 18 February\u201d (Ocenzurowano dnia 18.02) and an illegible signature. (see paragraph 15 above).\n51. The Court has held on many occasions that as long as the Polish authorities continue the practice of marking detainees\u2019 letters with the ocenzurowano stamp, the Court has no alternative but to presume that those letters have been opened and their contents read, even if there is no separate stamp on the letter as such (see Matwiejczuk v. Poland, no. 37641/97, \u00a7 99, 2 December 2003 and Pisk\u2011Piskowski v. Poland, no. 92/03, \u00a7 26, 14 June 2005, Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7 58, 4 May 2006).\nIt follows that censoring of the applicant\u2019s letter with the Court amounted to an \u201cinterference\u201d with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8.\n(b) Whether the interference was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d\n52. The Court notes that the interference took place while the applicant was in detention.\n53. As regards the interference with the right to respect for the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court, it further observes that, according to Article 214 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, persons detained should enjoy the same rights as those convicted by a final judgment. Accordingly, the prohibition of censorship of correspondence with the European Court of Human Rights contained in Article 103 of the 1997 Code, which expressly relates to convicted persons, was also applicable to detained persons (see Michta v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 61, Kwiek v. Poland, no. 51895/99, \u00a7 44, 30 May 2006). Thus, censorship of the letter from the Registry of the Court to the applicant was contrary to the domestic law.\n54. It follows that the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court was not \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d. Having regard to that finding, the Court does not consider it necessary to ascertain whether the other requirements of paragraph 2 of Article 8 were complied with.\nConsequently, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### IV. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n55. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that his detention had been unlawful.\n56. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint falls to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.\n57. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s detention was based on Article 258 \u00a7 1 of the 1997 Code of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, the Court observes on the basis of the material in the case file that the applicant was detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. The Court accordingly finds that the decision to place the applicant in custody had a legal basis and was issued by the appropriate judicial authority. There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined or lacked the necessary foreseeability required under the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). Moreover, the Court does not see any appearance of arbitrariness on the part of the relevant judicial authorities when deciding on the applicant\u2019s detention.\n58. The Court therefore concludes that the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n59. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill\u2011founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n60. The applicant also complained about the outcome and unfairness of the criminal proceedings. He alleged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n61. However, the Court reiterates that, in accordance with Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. Moreover, while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or the way it should be assessed, which are therefore primarily matters for regulation by national law and the national courts (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999\u2011I, with further references).\n62. In the present case the applicant did not allege any particular failure on the part of the relevant courts to respect his right to a fair hearing. Indeed, his complaints are limited to challenging the result of the proceedings leading to his allegedly wrongful conviction. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court finds no indication that the impugned proceedings were conducted unfairly.\n63. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill\u2011founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 46 OF THE CONVENTION\n64. Article 46 of the Convention provides:\n\u201c1. The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.\n2. The final judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its execution.\u201d\n65. Recently in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (cited above, paragraph 18 et seq, with further references, the Court referred to the above mentioned 2007 Resolution of the Committee of Ministers taken together with the number of judgments recently delivered and concluded:\n\u201c60. The Court thus concludes, as the Committee of Ministers did, that for many years, at least as recently as in 2007, numerous cases have demonstrated that the excessive length of pre-trial detention in Poland reveals a structural problem consisting of \u201ca practice that is incompatible with the Convention\u201d (see mutatis mutandis Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 190-191, ECHR 2004-V; Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813.\n66. As in other numerous similar detention cases, the authorities did not justify the applicant\u2019s continued detention by relevant and sufficient reasons (see paragraphs 35-39 above). Consequently, the Court sees no reason to diverge from its findings made in Kauczor as to the existence of the structural problem and the need for the Polish State to adopt measures to remedy the situation (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 60-62 ).\n### VI. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n67. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n68. The applicant\u2019s mother claimed PLN 20,000 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n69. The Government did not express their opinion on the matter.\n70. The Court considers that the applicant has suffered non\u2011pecuniary damage which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Considering the circumstances of the case and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, EUR 2,000 under this head.\n71. The Court considers that in the particular circumstances of the case, the finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention would constitute sufficient just satisfaction for the non\u2011pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n72. The applicant\u2019s mother did not make any claim for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts or before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n73. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaints concerning the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention and the censorship of his correspondence admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant\u2019s mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 21 July 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-77991": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OSUCH v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Osuch v. Poland,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr K. Traja,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr L. Garlicki,\nMs L. Mijovi\u0107, judges,\nand Mrs F. Elens-Passos, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 October 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nThe relevant provisions of the domestic law relating to preventive measures are set out in several judgments (see, among others, Jaworski v. Poland, no. 25715/02, \u00a7\u00a7 20-27, 28 March 2006).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and under Article 3 of the Convention that the length of his pre-trial detention was excessive. The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n17. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention lasted from 10 March 1999 to 16 January 2002, when the first-instance judgment was given. Accordingly, the period of his detention amounts to approximately 2 years and 10 months.\n##### 2. The reasonableness of the length of detention\n(a) The parties\u2019 arguments\n18. The Government maintained that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention was not excessive. They stated that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for justifying his detention during the entire period at issue. It was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings, especially in view of the gravity of the charges and the severe penalty that could be expected. The Government drew attention to the fact that the applicant had been charged with membership of an organised criminal group. There was therefore a serious risk that, if released, he would attempt to put pressure on witnesses or obstruct the proceedings.\n19. The Government argued that the domestic authorities showed due diligence when dealing with the case. They stressed that it was an extremely complex one as it concerned organised crime. They further maintained that all the applicant\u2019s requests for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were thoroughly examined by the competent courts.\n20. The applicant contested these arguments. He submitted that his detention had been inordinately lengthy.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n(i) Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n21. The Court reiterates that the question whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract but must be considered in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 110-111, ECHR 2000-X).\n22. Under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the national judicial authorities must ensure that the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for a departure from the rule in Article 5 and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release.\n23. The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see, for instance, Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000).\n(ii) Application of the principles to the circumstances of the present case\n24. The Court observes that in their decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention the judicial authorities relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, their serious nature and the heavy penalty which could be expected. They also referred to the risk that the applicant, if released, might obstruct the proper conduct of the trial or induce witnesses to give false testimony. They repeated those grounds in nearly all the decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 6-8 and 10 above).\n25. The Court agrees that the strong suspicion against the applicant of having committed serious offences could have initially warranted his detention. However, with the passage of time, the initial grounds for pre-trial detention become less relevant and the domestic courts should rely on other \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d grounds to justify the deprivation of liberty.\n26. The Government pointed out that the applicant had been charged with being a member of an organised criminal group. The Court accepts that in cases concerning organised crime, involving numerous accused, the process of gathering and hearing evidence is often a difficult task. Moreover, the Court considers that in cases such as the present one, concerning organised criminal groups, the risk that a detainee if released might put pressure on witnesses or other co-accused, or might otherwise obstruct the proceedings, is often particularly high. All these factors can justify a relatively longer period of detention on remand. However, they do not give the authorities unlimited power to prolong this preventive measure (see the Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 4 May 2006). Moreover, the Court cannot but note that there is no indication that before his arrest the applicant tried to induce witnesses or to obstruct the course of the proceedings in any other way.\n27. It should be noted that during the entire period of his detention, the authorities did not envisage the possibility of imposing on the applicant other measures \u2013 such as bail or police supervision \u2013 expressly foreseen by Polish law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings.\n28. In that context, the Court would reiterate that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the authorities, when deciding whether a person should be released or detained, are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at trial. Indeed, that provision proclaims not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial\u201d but also lays down that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see the Jab\u0142o\u0144ski judgment cited above, \u00a7 83).\n29. In the circumstances, the Court finds that the grounds given for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention were not \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d to justify holding him in custody for a period of 2 years and 10 months.\n30. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n32. The applicant claimed 20,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n33. The Government considered that the sum claimed by the applicant was excessively high. They asked the Court to rule that a finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction.\n34. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, the Court considers that the applicant has suffered some non-pecuniary damage \u2013 such as distress resulting from the protracted length of his detention \u2013 which is not sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation of the Convention. Considering the circumstances of the case and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n35. The applicant also claimed 200 PLN for each hearing that took place before the domestic courts. He submitted that about 40 hearings were held during the course of the proceedings.\n36. The Government contested these claims.\n37. The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II). In the present case, the Court finds that he has not produced any evidence supporting his claim as required by Rule 60 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, it makes no award under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n38. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 14 November 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Nicolas Bratza\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-94000": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ETEM KARAG\u00d6Z v.

Turkey,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nFran\u00e7oise Tulkens, President,\nIreneu Cabral Barreto,\nVladimiro Zagrebelsky,\nDanut\u0117 Jo\u010dien\u0117,\nAndr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3,\nNona Tsotsoria,\nI\u015f\u0131l Karaka\u015f, judges,\nand Sally Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 August 2009,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n12. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that the length of his detention on remand had been excessive. He further contended under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention that there were no remedies in domestic law to challenge the length of his detention on remand.\n13. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, began when he was taken into police custody on 19 January 1994 and continued until he was convicted by the trial court on 30 July 1997. From 30 July 1997 until his conviction was quashed by the Court of Cassation on 1 March 1999, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and therefore that period of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see Cahit Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 34623/03, \u00a7 34, 14 June 2007 and the cases cited therein). From 1 March 1999 until his conviction by the trial court again on 9 March 2007, however, the applicant was once more in pre-trial detention for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It follows that the applicant spent a total of over eleven years and six months as a remand prisoner.\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n14. The Government argued that there had been a genuine requirement of public interest for the continued detention of the applicant, who had been charged with a serious offence. There had also been a high risk of him escaping and committing further crimes.\n15. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n16. The Court observes that the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court failed to indicate to what extent the applicant\u2019s release would have posed a risk, after \u2013 by then \u2013 well over eleven years of detention (including the periods of imprisonment after conviction), in its last decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention pending his trial at first instance. Neither are there any documents in the file to suggest that the trial court, which ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention on many occasions, at any time displayed concern about the length of the applicant\u2019s detention.\n17. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, \u00a7\u00a7 18-24, 2 February 2006; Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, \u00a7 44, 16 January 2007; G\u00fcve\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 70337/01, \u00a7 108, 20 January 2009).\n18. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n19. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.\n#### B. Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention\n20. The Government submitted that the applicant had challenged his detention period before the trial court, which indicated that an effective remedy had been available. Alternatively, if the applicant had believed that the domestic remedies were ineffective, then he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the detention order.\n21. The Court has already examined the possibility of challenging the lawfulness of pre-trial detention in Turkey at the relevant time and concluded that it offered little prospect of success in practice as it did not provide for a procedure that was genuinely adversarial for the accused (see Do\u011fan Yal\u00e7\u0131n v. Turkey, no. 15041/03, \u00a7 43, 19 February 2008). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its previous findings. Additionally the Court observes that the applicant challenged his detention, albeit unsuccessfully, on 20 October 2005, whereas the present application was introduced beforehand, on 18 August 2005. The Government\u2019s objection concerning compliance with the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is not, therefore, pertinent.\n22. In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there has been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained that the length of the criminal proceedings lodged against him had exceeded the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. The Government contested that argument. They maintained that the case was complex and involved eight suspects who had been accused of several illegal actions. They contended that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities. In this connection they referred to the judgment in the case of \u0130ntiba v. Turkey (no. 42585/98, 24 May 2005) where the Court found a total period of ten years to be reasonable.\n25. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n26. The Court observes that the proceedings began on 19 January 1994 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and ended on 7 March 2008 when the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment. They thus lasted over fourteen years for two levels of jurisdiction delivering four judgments.\n27. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to that in the present application (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II, and Ert\u00fcrk v. Turkey, no. 15259/02, 12 April 2005).\n28. The Court notes that the circumstances in the case of \u0130ntiba v. Turkey (see above) referred to by the Government differ from the present application. In particular, that applicant had not been detained on remand; the length taken into consideration was seven years and eleven months; and approximately three years and three months of this period was attributable to the applicant.\n29. Having examined all the material submitted to it and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n30. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n32. The applicant submitted that, as a result of his arrest and detention, he had been unable to work and thus support his family. He claimed 50,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 50,000 for non-pecuniary damage.\n33. The Government contested these claims.\n34. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violations found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it accepts that the applicant must have suffered some non-pecuniary damage which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation alone. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and having regard to its case-law, the Court awards the applicant EUR 15,600 for non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n35. The applicant also claimed EUR 4,850 for costs and expenses incurred before the Court. In support of his claim the applicant submitted a schedule of costs, showing the hours spent by his lawyer on the case.\n36. The Government considered the sums to be excessive and unsupported by adequate documentation.\n37. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 3,000 under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n38. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following sums, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 15,600 (fifteen thousand six hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage,\n(ii) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros), plus any tax chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 15 September 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-73360": "\ufeff\nFORMER\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DICKSON v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving regard to the observations of the parties,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n13. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by Section 47 of the Prison Act, 1952, which, in so far as material, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein...\u201d\n14. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n15. The long standing policy of the prison service, set out above in the letter of Secretary of State of 28 May 2003 was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 of age. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n16. They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The Government argued that the policy was justified: (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single parent families.\n17. The Court of Appeal considered, while the first reason did no more than restate the policy, the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy. In giving judgment for the court, Lord Phillips said (at paragraphs 44 ff):\n\u201c[The Secretary of State] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy. I agree. Penal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system.\nFurthermore, [the applicants\u2019] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201cjustified\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustified public concern\u201d. A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern...\n... [the applicants] submitted that [the disadvantage of single parent families] was not a material consideration when formulating prison policy... Again, I do not agree. By imprisoning the husband the State creates the situation where, if the wife is to have a child, that child will, until the husband\u2019s release, be brought up in a single parent family. I consider it legitimate, and indeed desirable, that the State should consider the implications of children being brought up in those circumstances when deciding whether or not to have a general policy of facilitating the artificial insemination of the wives of prisoners or of wives who are themselves prisoners.\nFor those reasons [the applicants have] failed to make out his case that the Secretary of State\u2019s policy only to facilitate artificial insemination in exceptional circumstances is irrational. [The applicants] accepted that there were in this case no exceptional circumstances, and [they were] right to do so.\u201d\n18. For those reasons the court concluded that the policy was not a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 8. Lord Phillips remarked that, for any applicant claiming exceptional circumstances, the normal \u201cstarting point\u201d should be the need to demonstrate that, if facilities for artificial insemination were not provided, conception would not just be delayed but prevented altogether.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained about the refusal of access to artificial insemination facilities and argued that that refusal breached their right to respect for private and family life under Article 8. That Article, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, ... .\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n20. They maintained that the aim of the restriction had to be punishment (as there was no security or other physical or financial barrier) but that, if that was the objective, it would be incoherent to admit of any exceptions to this punitive policy.\n21. In any event, it required considerable justification to take away a fundamental right. Indeed, the starting point of the policy was all wrong: it should be that they had a right to conceive children unless there were compelling reasons against. The applicants relied on the Chamber\u2019s judgment in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) (no. 74025/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 44, ECHR 2004 ...). They maintained that the social factors (the interests of the putative child and of society) underlying the policy and the response to their request by the Secretary of State were not factors contemplated by the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.\n22. In any event, there were insufficient reasons to justify the impugned restriction. A request for artificial insemination did not pose a threat to security. There was no rational link between the offence and the punishment: a person convicted of offences against children could coherently be deprived of parental rights whereas the refusal of the requested facilities indiscriminately (except in exceptional cases) was unjustifiable.\n23. As to the application of the policy in their case, the applicants underlined that a refusal of artificial insemination to them meant that their right to found a family would be extinguished: they could not have a child together given the second applicant\u2019s age, the accepted point of departure for the consideration of a request for artificial insemination. Even if it could be said that the first applicant forfeited some of his rights when he was imprisoned, the same could not be said of the second applicant, a point with which the Court of Appeal and the Government failed to grapple. They disputed the Secretary of State\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient financial provision: the second applicant owned a property worth 200,000 pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d), she was following a course in counselling and, on qualification, she would be able to command an hourly rate of 30 GBP. It was unfair to state that their relationship had not been tested: the strength of any relationship (prisoner or other) was uncertain, there was no link between imprisonment and dissolution of relationship and, indeed, the first applicant\u2019s imprisonment had not weakened their relationship. In any event, this latter argument was circuitous as it could automatically negate any request for artificial insemination from long term prisoners such as the first applicant. It was equally unjust and circular to argue that the first applicant would be initially absent: it was absence for the foreseeable future that rendered the request for artificial insemination necessary \u2013 if the first applicant was to have been shortly released, he would not have needed to make the request.\n24. The Government submitted that the restriction was a punishment the consequences of which were not disproportionate to the aim of maintaining a penal system designed to punish and deter.\nThe policy was consistent with relevant Convention case-law namely, five Commission decisions (No. 6564/74, Dec. 21.5.75, 2 Decision and Reports (\u201cDR\u201d), p. 105; No. 8166/78, Dec. 3.10.78, 13 DR, p. 241; Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Commission report of 13 December 1979, 24 DR, p. 5; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Commission report of 10 July 1980, 24 DR, p. 72; and ELH and PBH v. the United Kingdom, nos. 32094/96 and 32568/96, Commission decision of 22 October 1997, 91A DR, p. 61). The Court of Appeal in the above-cited Mellor case accurately summarised that case-law as containing five principles: the qualifications on the right to respect for family life applied equally to Article 12; imprisonment was incompatible with the exercise of conjugal rights and consequently involved an interference with the right to respect for family life; this restriction was ordinarily justifiable under the provisions of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention; in exceptional circumstances it might be necessary to relax the imposition of detention in order to avoid a disproportionate interference with a particular human right; and there was no Convention jurisprudence which indicated that a prisoner was entitled to assert the right to found a family by artificial insemination. The approach of the Court of Appeal, as noted in the Mellor and the present case, was identical to that of the Convention organs.\nThe Government further maintained that the policy was consistent with the Convention because it enabled examination of the individual merits of each case. Its justification was to be found in three principles: losing the opportunity to beget children was one of the ordinary consequences of imprisonment; public confidence in the operation of the prison system would be undermined if prisoners could continue to conceive children while serving long sentences for serious offences; and the inevitable absence of one parent for a long period would have negative consequences for the child and for society as a whole. Accordingly, the normal starting point was that artificial insemination facilities would not be granted unless their refusal would prevent the founding of a family altogether. Thereafter, the authorities would take into account other relevant factors such as raising a child in the absence of a father, the stability of the relationship and public concern.\nAs to the application of the policy in the present case, the Government noted that the fact that the applicants would not be able to conceive children naturally was overcome by the other reasons relied upon by the Secretary of State.\nFinally, the Government maintained that they should be afforded a wide margin of appreciation, the case involving as it did a claim that the State should take positive action to promote Convention rights in an area of social policy where difficult choices had to be made between the rights of an individual and the needs of society. They noted that there did not appear to be any European consensus in favour of the provision of facilities for artificial insemination of prisoners.\nThe applicants, in response, argued that the jurisprudence cited by the Government was unreliable: it was Commission jurisprudence, it was old and therefore not indicative of current evolutions and trends and it was not, in any event, directly on point. The matter was therefore free of precedent. They would pay for the requested facilities themselves, so there would be no financial burden. The Government had failed to develop or explain why not being able to beget children should be necessarily part of the punishment of imprisonment. It was a policy that discriminated against the first applicant vis-\u00e0-vis a life sentence prisoner who had been allowed into open conditions with trips home. The applicants also contended that moral considerations were not a matter for the Government when considering the effectiveness of human rights. The Government contested that argument.\n#### B. Admissibility\n25. Having regard to the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court considers that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### C. Merits\n26. It is well established that prisoners do not forfeit their Convention rights following conviction and sentence and continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty: those rights include the right to continue to enjoy respect for family and private life (Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2005 ... citing, inter alia, Ploski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, judgment of 12 November 2002). As to the present case, artificial insemination relates to the applicants\u2019 private and family life in such a way that the question of their access thereto falls within the ambit of Article 8 (the above-cited cases of E.L.H. and P.B.H v. the United Kingdom, Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, ECHR 2001-XI and Aliev v. Ukraine, no. 41220/98, \u00a7 187-189, 29 April 2003.\n27. It nevertheless remains the case that any measure depriving a prisoner of liberty by definition has some effect on the normal incidents of liberty and inevitably entails limitations and controls on the exercise of Convention rights, including a measure of control on prisoners\u2019 contacts with the outside world and, more particularly for present purposes, on the possibility of begetting a child. The fact of such control is not, in principle, incompatible with the Convention (Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, \u00a7 98; the above-cited decision in Kalashnikov v. Russia; Klamecki v. Poland (no. 2), no. 31583/96, \u00a7 144, 3 April 2003; and Aliev v. Ukraine, cited above, at \u00a7 187). The key issue is whether the nature and extent of that control can be considered compatible with the Convention.\n28. The first step in any such assessment is to identify whether the impugned restriction constitutes an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family lives (the State\u2019s negative obligations) or a failure by the State to fulfil a positive obligation in those respects.\n29. The Court accepts that the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition (Selmani v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 70258/01, ECHR 2001 VII). It has indeed previously classified certain restrictions on the exercise of contact rights of prisoners as interferences as regards, inter alia, ordinary visits (Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, ECHR 2000 X), conjugal visits (the above-cited Aliev case) and attending funerals (the above-cited Ploski case).\n30. However, in the present case, the Court considers that the impugned restriction does not limit a general entitlement already in place in a prison environment (for example, controlling the mechanics of contact with family and visits) but rather concerns the State\u2019s refusal to take steps exceptionally to allow something (the possibility of the begetting of children by prisoners) not already an existing general right or entitlement. The Court considers therefore that the applicants effectively complained that, in refusing access to artificial insemination facilities, the State failed to fulfil a positive obligation to secure respect for private or family life.\n31. The requirements of the notion of \u201crespect\u201d for private and family life in Article 8 are not clear-cut, especially as far as the positive obligations inherent in that concept are concerned, and vary considerably from case to case having regard, notably, to the diversity of situations obtaining in Contracting States and the choices which must be made in terms of the State\u2019s priorities and resources. These considerations are particularly relevant in the present case. The issues raised by the case touch on an area where there is little common ground amongst the member States of the Council of Europe. The present applicants did not suggest that there was any European consensus in favour of granting artificial insemination facilities to prisoners and indeed were unable to point to any other Contracting State which affords prisoners access to such facilities. Nor can the Court discern in this regard any \u201cevolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved\u201d (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.28957/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002 VI). It is true that it appears that more than half the Contracting States allow for conjugal visits for prisoners, subject to a variety of different restrictions, a measure which may be seen as obviating the need for the authorities to provide in addition facilities for artificial insemination. However, the Court notes that, while it has expressed its approval for the movement in several European countries to grant conjugal visits, it has not yet interpreted the Convention as requiring Contracting States to make provision for such visits (see the above-cited Aliev judgment, at \u00a7 188). Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals.\n32. In determining the existence and scope of any positive obligation, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual, the search for which is inherent throughout the Convention. The aims mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 8 \u201cmay\u201d have \u201ca certain relevance\u201d only. Moreover, any such obligation must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (Rees v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, \u00a7 37, Gaskin v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 160, \u00a7 42; Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 V, \u00a7 52; Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7 116; and Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003 VI).\n33. The Court notes that, as a matter of general policy, requests by prisoners in the United Kingdom for artificial insemination are only granted by the authorities in exceptional circumstances. In reaching a decision as to whether such circumstances exist in any individual case, particular attention is given by the authorities to a number of general considerations which are set out in the Secretary of State\u2019s letter of 28 May 2003. As explained by the respondent Government, and as reflected in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in the above-cited Mellor case and in the present case, two principal aims underlie the policy: the maintenance of public confidence in the penal system and the welfare of any child conceived as a result of artificial insemination and, therefore, the general interests of society as a whole.\n34. As to the former aim, while reiterating that there is no place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic forfeiture of rights by prisoners based purely on what might offend public opinion (the above-cited Hirst judgment, at \u00a7 70), the Court nevertheless accepts that the maintaining of public confidence in the penal system has a legitimate role to play in the development of penal policy within prisons. The Court also considers valid that, in developing and applying the policy, the authorities retained certain criteria which concerned the interests of any child to be conceived. The very object of a request for artificial insemination is the conception of a child and the State has positive obligations to ensure the effective protection and the moral and material welfare of children.\n35. As to the policy itself, the Court attaches particular importance to the fact that, in contrast to the law which was in issue in the Hirst case, it did not operate to impose a blanket restriction on a prisoner\u2019s access to artificial insemination facilities, without any consideration of individual circumstances. On the contrary, as was explained in the letter of the Secretary of State, requests for artificial insemination were carefully considered on individual merit and according to the various criteria set out in the letter. Having examined these criteria, the Court does not find them to be arbitrary or not reasonably related to the underlying aims of the policy. Nor, on the material before the Court, can it be suggested that the examination of an individual case in the light of the considerations set out in the letter is merely theoretical or illusory: the unchallenged evidence before the Court of Appeal was that the Secretary of State had already allowed access to insemination facilities in certain cases, while two applications were struck out by the former Commission when artificial insemination facilities were granted to the applicants (P.G. v. the United Kingdom, no. 10822/84, Commission decision of 7 May 1987; and G. and R.S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 17142/90, Commission decision of 10 July 1991, both unpublished).\n36. The question remains whether the application of the criteria to refuse access to artificial insemination facilities in the present case upset the fair balance which must be preserved.\n37. The Court has had regard, on the one hand, to the difficult situation in which the applicants find themselves. Artificial insemination remains the only realistic hope of having a child together, since the second applicant will be 51 by the earliest release date of the first applicant. Further, as pointed out by the applicants, the requested facilities would not be as onerous for the authorities as those required for conjugal visits and the applicants indicated their willingness to bear the costs of the procedure. The second applicant, moreover, maintained that she had sufficient resources to care for any child born as a result of artificial insemination.\n38. On the other hand, the Court notes that careful consideration was given by the Secretary of State to the individual circumstances of the present applicants, including the unlikelihood of conception after the date of the first applicant\u2019s release from prison, before concluding that these factors were outweighed by the other factors to which reference was made \u2013 in particular, the nature and gravity of the first applicant\u2019s crime and the welfare of any child who might be conceived, in the light of the prolonged absence of the father for an important part of its childhood years and the apparent lack of sufficient material provision and immediate support network in place for the mother and child. The Court further notes that the decision of the Secretary of State was examined by the High Court and the Court of Appeal which found not only that the policy was rational and lawful but that, in applying the policy in the circumstances of the present case, the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse the facilities was neither unreasonable nor disproportionate.\n39. In these circumstances and having regard to the wide margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities, the Court finds that it has not been shown that the decision to refuse facilities for artificial insemination in the present case was arbitrary or unreasonable or that it failed to strike a fair balance between the competing interests. Accordingly, there is in the present case no appearance of a failure to respect the applicants\u2019 rights to private and family life.\n40. There has been no violation therefore of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 12 OF THE CONVENTION\n41. The applicants also complained that the refusal of access to artificial insemination facilities breached their right to found a family under Article 12 of the Convention, which Article reads as follows:\n\u201cMen and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of that right.\u201d\nThe parties made the same submissions in this context as under Article 8 and the applicants accepted that a conclusion of no violation under Article 8 would lead to no violation of Article 12 of the Convention.\nThe Court recalls that an interference with family life which is justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the Convention cannot at the same time constitute a violation of Article 12 (Boso v. Italy (dec.), no. 50490/99, ECHR 2002 VII). Having regard to the Court\u2019s conclusion under Article 8 above, the Court considers that the same conclusion applies as regards the present complaint. There has therefore been no violation of Article 12 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible unanimously\n2. Holds by 4 votes to 3 that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention; and\n3. Holds by 4 votes to 3 that there has been no violation of Article 12 of the Convention;\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 18 April 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) Concurring opinion of Mr Bonello;\n(b) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Casadevall and Mr Garlicki;\n(c) dissenting opinion of Mr Borrego Borrego.\n#### J.C.\nMOB\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE BONELLO\nEssential Facts\n1. The first applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His earliest date of release could be 2009, but there is no certainty about this. In 1999 he met the second applicant who was also serving a prison sentence and in 2001 they got married. She already has three children from previous relationships. They applied for permission to have a child by artificial insemination, but the prison authorities refused and the courts endorsed this refusal.\nThe protection of the rights of others\n2. Though I have considerable sympathy for the applicants\u2019 plight and for the minority view, I nonetheless opted for not finding a violation of Article 8. The reasoning of the judgement I regard as persuasive, even if I would have relied less heavily on the state\u2019s margin of appreciation and on the government\u2019s primary argument that the maintenance of public confidence in the penal system would have been undermined by allowing life prisoners to conceive children by artificial insemination.\n3. The Convention enjoins states not to interfere with the enjoyment of family life; in fact it imposes a positive duty to promote it. This enjoyment not being an absolute right, interferences are permissible in the circumstances enumerated by Article 8(2), among them \u201cthe protection of the rights and freedoms of others\u201d.\n4. Nothing in the Convention guarantees to a person a \u2018right\u2019 to procreate. What the Convention more cogently guarantees is \u2018the right to found a family\u2019 (Article 12). I am hardly convinced that procreating a child through artificial insemination by a life prisoner is embraced in the right secured by Article 12. The concept of \u2018family\u2019 enshrined in Articles 8 and 12, in my view, requires more than the mere forwarding of sperm from a distance in circumstances which preclude the donor from participating meaningfully in any significant function related to parenthood. \u2018Family\u2019 necessarily implies at least the possibility of emotional and physical proximity, bonding, the assumption of parental responsibilities, together with a vestige of communal life. This, of course, only applies to the husband. In his case, the very nature of life imprisonment makes sure to pre-empt a priori all, or most, of these requisites.\n5. The position appears substantially different in so far as the wife is concerned. She is now out of prison and should be presumed to be able to set in being a family life with her eventual offspring. In her case the test however still requires balancing her natural craving to found a family, on the one hand, with the rights of the child she desires to generate on the other. The particular circumstances of this case lead me to believe that permitting offspring to be born to the applicants would not be fostering the best interests of the desired child. It would, on the contrary, be injurious to the \u2018rights of others\u2019.\n6. In the architecture of the Convention, at least as fundamental as the right of a woman to be a mother, is the dogma of the supreme interest of children. In conflicts where the interests of a child are an issue, the ethic guiding domestic courts and this Court has been that the \u201cprotection of the rights of the child\u201d should be paramount. I see no reason to depart from this hierarchy in the present case.\n7. I am far from persuaded that kick-starting into life a child in the meanest circumstances, could be viewed as an exercise in promoting its finest interests. The debut of life in a one-parent family, deprived of the presence of the father and of a father-figure, offspring of a life prisoner convicted for the most serious crime of violence, would not quite appear to be the best way of giving a child-to-be a headstart in life. The Government have highlighted the applicants\u2019 \u201cseeming insufficiency\u201d of material resources to provide for the upbringing of the child that might be conceived. The wife has denied this, but has failed to produce any evidence to disprove it. In other words, it would seem that the parents are not totally averse from delegating to social welfare a good tranche of their parental responsibilities.\n8. As far as the child to be born to the applicants is concerned, another factor that weighs against the \u2018best interests\u2019 priority is the fact that the applicants met and married in prison. Of course this is not, in itself, particularly determining or even influential, save for the following reason. Even assuming that the husband is released within a reasonable time (there is no certainty about that), the union of the applicants still remains that engendered in a dysfunctional ambience, where restriction and control are the rule and liberty the dream. It is highly speculative whether a union that has not been tested in the normal circumstances of daily life would be a preferred platform to ensure a fulfilling infancy for the desired child. Moreover, the precarious antecedents of a marriage firmly anchored in singularity are in no way counterbalanced by any support networks in place on the mother\u2019s side.\n9. I am not particularly impressed by the argument that society regularly allows children to be born in similar or worse circumstances. The present is not a case in which society would be \u2018allowing\u2019 a conception in unpromising conditions, but one in which the state is being asked to become an active accomplice and participant in this future conception. I believe a responsible state to be right to require of itself standards higher than those beyond its control in the free procreation market.\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES CASADEVALL AND GARLICKI\nWe cannot agree with the majority\u2019s finding that there has been no violation of Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention.\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court judgment in Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942), the fundamental nature of the right to procreate has been recognized in constitutional jurisprudence; the European Court of Human Rights also conforms to that position (Evans v. the United Kingdom, no. 6339/05, 7 March 2006, not yet final, \u00a7 57). In consequence, access to artificial insemination also falls within the ambit of Article 8 (and \u2013 in relation to married couples \u2013 within the ambit of Article 12). The problem here is whether the State is allowed to deny such access to all, or some, prisoners. The majority was, of course, correct when it noted, \u201cit is well established that prisoners continue to enjoy all fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty\u201d (par. 26). But it also means that interference with the right to procreate is permissible only if it could be qualified as one of those limitations on private and family life that are inevitably entailed by the deprivation of liberty.\nWe think that the majority erred in three respects: 1) in classifying the nature of the prohibition of artificial insemination; 2) in assessing the United Kingdom general policy in regard to artificial insemination; 3) in assessing the particular circumstances of the case.\nAs to point 1, the majority based its reasoning on the distinction between restrictions constituting interferences with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family life and restrictions constituting a failure by the State to fulfil a positive obligation in those respects. While the majority accepted that the prohibition of conjugal visits should be classified within the State\u2019s negative obligations, it considered that the refusal of artificial insemination belongs to the area of positive obligations (see \u00a7 30), and that the State\u2019s margin of appreciation was correspondingly wider. We cannot agree, because \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 there is no rationale for such a distinction. If conjugal visits were allowed, no problem of artificial insemination would emerge. The restrictions on artificial insemination become important only where there is a prohibition of conjugal visits. Artificial insemination, at least when, as in this case, the prospective parents are ready to cover the necessary expenses, does not require any particular assistance by the prison authorities (and also in this respect shows similarity to procreation resulting from a conjugal visit). Thus, there is no reason to assume a difference in nature between the prohibition of conjugal visits and the denial of access to artificial insemination. Both restrictions have the same \u201cantiprocreationist\u201d effect and should be assessed within the framework of \u201cnegative obligations\u201d. In consequence, the margin of appreciation in decisions on artificial inseminations cannot be wider than in decisions on conjugal visits.\nAs to point 2, the majority examined the general policy in regard to prisoners\u2019 requests for artificial insemination and did not find it to be arbitrary or not reasonably related to the underlying aims of the policy (\u00a7 35). At the material time, this policy was based on six considerations (see \u00a7 8). We are ready to agree that those considerations were drafted in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Convention. What bothers us is the first paragraph of the \u201cpolicy\u201d stating that requests for artificial insemination \u201cwill only be granted in exceptional circumstances\u201d. In our opinion, such an approach runs counter to the very philosophy of human rights. This philosophy is based on the assumption that the accessibility of a right constitutes a rule and limitation of a right is an exception. The \u201cpolicy\u201d reversed this assumption. What should have been a rule became an exception and what should have been an exception became a rule. It reversed also the burden of proof, because under that approach a justification must be produced for exercising a right and not for restricting such exercise.\nWe have doubts whether such an \u201cinverse approach\u201d is compatible with the general principle that prisoners continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms save for the right to liberty. We have no doubt that it is not compatible with the rights of the non-detained spouse who was also affected by the refusal of artificial insemination.\nAs to the point 3: But even if the \u201cgeneral policy\u201d were found to be compatible with the Convention, its application, in the Dicksons\u2019 case, was not. The biological reality put the second applicant before an alternative: either she would be given access to artificial insemination or she would not be able to procreate within marriage. It would be difficult to find a situation more exceptional than that one. What was at stake was not a temporary limitation of the right, but its full and irrevocable destruction. Only very serious reasons can justify such interference. We are unable to discern such reasons from the Secretary\u2019s of State refusal and some of his arguments sound a bit too paternalistic to us. It is not for the State to decide who may have children and when. We also have difficulty accepting that the refusal was necessary for the maintenance of public confidence in the penal system (see \u00a7 38 of the judgment). What both applicants really wanted was to plan their life for the future and not to reorganise the current execution of punishment. That is why we cannot share the majority\u2019s assessment that the domestic authorities struck a fair balance between the competing interests. The limitation imposed on the applicants was not inevitably entailed by the deprivation of liberty. Leave for artificial insemination would not change anything in the timing and manner of execution of the prison sentence. But its refusal will affect the whole future life of the applicants since it deprives them of the possibility to found a family.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE BORREGO BORREGO\nTo my great regret, I cannot agree with the opinion of the majority.\nIn the first place, the present judgment contains numerous remarks about the first applicant, a man serving a prison sentence, about the priorities and resources of the State and \u201cthe moral and material welfare of child to be conceived\u201d. However, I have not found a single remark about the second applicant, a woman at liberty, married to the prisoner, who at nearly 50 years of age is prepared to undergo an artificial insemination process in order to have a child by her husband. In my sincere opinion Mrs Dickson is the \u201cforgotten person\u201d in this case.\nIn an artificial insemination process the man\u2019s role is essential but rather limited: it consists merely in supplying semen, which is then sealed in a small sterilised container. The first applicant could hand over this semen to his wife when she visits him in prison, and it could then be kept for several hours at room temperature. The woman\u2019s role, on the other hand, is more complicated, and may involve a considerable amount of pain. Nor should it be forgotten that success is far from guaranteed.\nThat being said, and bearing in mind the very restricted role of the first applicant in such a process, it is difficult for me to understand how it can be asserted that \u201cthese considerations [the State\u2019s priorities and resources] are particularly relevant in the present case\u201d (paragraph 31).\nPreventing the first applicant from donating his sperm to his wife without any physical relations between the two is justified in the judgment by:\n(a) \u201cThe nature and gravity of the first applicant\u2019s crime\u201d\nThis argument amounts to a temporary de facto sterilisation of the first applicant until 2009, when he will be released.\nThat is a punishment not imposed by any court and one which, in my opinion, is rather absurd. From 2009 onwards the first applicant may have physical relations with his wife and, without any hindrance, attempt by that means to become a father. Does that mean that by 2009 \u201cthe nature and gravity of the (...) crime\u201d will have ceased to exist? In any event, what really is likely to have ceased to exist is the ability of the second applicant, who will be 51 in 2009, to conceive a child.\n(b) \u201cThe welfare of any child who might be conceived, in the light of the prolonged absence of the father for an important part of his childhood years\u201d\nI do not wish to go into the debate about whether it is the father or the mother who plays the decisive role in the first years of a child\u2019s life, but I do wish to say that once again in this case it is the second applicant, the potential mother, who has been forgotten.\nI find the British authorities\u2019 approach, endorsed in the present judgment, paternalist. The same reasoning would militate against the conception of a child where one parent is suffering from a fatal illness and has very little chance of surviving later than its birth. The judgment is therefore hostile to the conception of a baby unless, among other conditions, the stability of the couple is guaranteed and so on.\n(c) \u201cThe apparent lack of sufficient material provision and immediate support network in place, for the mother and child\u201d\nThe possible future mother \u201cmaintained that she had sufficient resources to care for the child born as a result of artificial insemination\u201d (paragraph 37). That assertion is not contested in the judgment, which merely states \u201c... for the mother and child\u201d. From whom? From the man? I prefer to refrain from any comment.\nI consider that refusing to allow the first applicant to donate his sperm to his wife, thus preventing her, in view of her age, from trying to have a child with her husband through artificial insemination, is contrary to the rights guaranteed by Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention.\nI hope that this judgment will be examined by the Grand Chamber. Were the Grand Chamber to rule that there has been a violation of the Convention, there would still be a chance for the second applicant. It really would be regrettable if a real problem became, through the passage of time, a purely theoretical one. The Convention guarantees rights which are \u201cpractical and effective\u201d, not \u201ctheoretical or illusory\u201d.", "001-84379": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OPA\u0141KO v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n20. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n22. The Government did not comment on the merits of the applicant's complaint.\n23. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 January 1992. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 19 April 2006. It thus lasted almost 13 years for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24. The Government raised an objection that the applicant cannot be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Court notes that this issue falls to be determined in the light of the principles established under the Court's case-law (Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 69\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011... and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 178\u2011213, ECHR 2006 - ...).\n25. The Wroclaw Court of Appeal analysed the course of the impugned proceedings in the light of the criteria which the Court itself applies. It concluded that the Regional Court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay and awarded the applicant the equivalent of EUR 514 in respect of the length of the proceedings. The just satisfaction awarded by the Court of Appeal amounts to approximately 7 per cent of what the Court would be likely to have awarded the applicant at that time in accordance with its practice, taking into account the particular circumstances of the proceedings. The Court thus concludes that the redress provided to the applicant at domestic level, considered on the basis of the facts of which he complains before the Court, was insufficient (see Czajka v. Poland, no. 15067/02, \u00a7 56, 13 February 2007). In these circumstances, the argument that the applicant has lost his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d cannot be upheld.\n26. The Government also submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that he had not lodged a civil claim for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of proceedings with the Polish civil courts under Article 417 of the Civil Code.\n27. The applicant contested the Government's arguments and submitted that he had made use of a remedy available to him and, particularly given his advanced age, he should not be required to initiate another set of proceedings.\n28. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires an applicant first to use the remedies provided by the national legal system. The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2275\u201376, \u00a7\u00a7 51\u201352).\n29. The Court also reiterates that, although Article 35 \u00a7 1 requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, it does not require that, in cases where the national law provides for several parallel remedies in various branches of law, the person concerned, after an attempt to obtain redress through one such remedy, must necessarily try all other means (see, mutatis mutandis, H.D. v. Poland (dec.), no. 33310/96, 7 June 2001, Kaniewski v. Poland, no. 38049/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-39, 8 November 2005).\n30. The Court notes that the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings under the 2004 Act. On 26 April 2005 the Poznan Court of Appeal admitted that the proceedings had been lengthy and awarded the applicant the equivalent to EUR 514 in compensation.\nThe Court has already examined that remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and found it effective in respect of complaints about the excessive length of judicial proceedings in Poland (see Michalak v. Poland (dec.) no. 24549/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43).\n31. The Court considers therefore that, having exhausted the available remedy provided by the 2004 Act, the applicant was not required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for compensation (see Cichla v. Poland, no. 18036/03, \u00a7 26, 10 October 2006). Accordingly, the Court concludes that, for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies. For these reasons, the Government's plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n32. The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n34. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n35. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Moreover, the Court notes that the case lay dormant for three and a half years before being transferred to the Court of Appeal and that the Government failed to give any explanation of this delay (see paragraph 9 above). Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n37. The applicant claimed 20,000 Polish zlotys (approximately 5,500 euros (EUR) on the date on which the claim had been submitted) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n38. The Government submitted that the claim was exorbitant.\n39. The Court considers that the applicant must have sustained non-pecuniary damage resulting from the protracted length of the proceedings. In the particular circumstances of the case it considers that it should award the full sum claimed.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n40. The applicant also claimed PLN 3,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court.\n41. The Government contested the claim.\n42. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant, who was not represented by a lawyer, the sum of EUR 500 covering costs under all heads.\n#### C. Default interest\n43. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 5,500 (five thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 500 (five hundred euros) for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 15 January 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-95199": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KALGI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n13. The Land Registry Act (Law No. 3402) entered into force on 9 October 1987. Section 29 provides that even in the absence of the parties hearings are to be held, the proceedings are to continue and the case is not be suspended.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the length of the civil proceedings had exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n15. The Government requested the Court to take into account solely the proceedings which took place after 28 January 1987, the date of deposit of Turkey's declaration recognising the right of individual petition to the European Commission of Human Rights. Moreover, they submitted that the applicant had only become a party to the proceedings as of 22 November 2004 when he began to be represented by a lawyer. The applicant did not make any comment.\n16. The Court notes that it is not clear from the case file exactly when the applicant became a party to the proceedings, which began on 28 August 1972. The first mention of the applicant in the proceedings dates back to 9 June 1983, when the trial court requested the applicant's address to be determined. In the absence of any document indicating that the applicant had become involved in the proceedings before then, the Court considers that it should take 9 June 1983 as the date the proceedings began in respect of the applicant. It notes that they are still pending before the domestic courts. Taking into account of the Court's competence ratione temporis, they have thus already lasted some twenty-two years and nine months since the Government's recognition of the right of individual petition on 28 January 1987. It notes, however, that by that date the proceedings had apparently already been pending some three years and seven months in respect of the applicant.\n#### B. Admissibility\n17. The Government argued that the applicant lacked victim status as he had only recently become involved in the proceedings. The applicant did not make any comment.\n18. The Court accepts that the applicant did not pursue the proceedings with due diligence. Nevertheless, it notes that the Land Registry Act (Law no. 3402) requires the domestic courts to continue with the proceedings and resolve the issues even in the absence of both parties (see paragraph 13 above). Accordingly, it considers that the applicant can claim to be the victim of excessively lengthy proceedings (see Mahmut and Z\u00fclf\u00fc Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131 v. Turkey, nos. 19895/03 and 21302/03, \u00a7 28, 21 October 2008).\n19. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### C. Merits\n20. The Government argued that, since the applicant's active involvement in 2004, the proceedings have not been excessively long. The applicant did not make any comment. However, the Court notes that it has already taken as the starting date for the present proceedings the 28 January 1987 (paragraph 16 above).\n21. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n22. In the present case the Court observes that the determination of the claim required expert evidence, an on-site inspection and the hearing of witnesses. Therefore it was of a certain complexity.\n23. Nevertheless, the Court notes that there have been substantial delays throughout the proceedings and, as much as the applicant's absence may have contributed to their length, it cannot be considered the main reason. In accordance with domestic law, the trial court was under an obligation to carry on with the proceedings even in the applicant's absence (see paragraph 13 above). The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to those of the present application (see, mutatis mutandis, Me\u015frure S\u00fcmer v. Turkey, no. 64725/01, \u00a7 49, 8 April 2008). Neither the complexity of the case nor the conduct of the parties is sufficient to explain such long delays by the first-instance court in the present case.\n24. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. The Court concludes that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n25. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the excessive length of the proceedings had infringed his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions, as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Government rejected this claim.\n27. The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.\n28. However, having regard to its finding under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraph 25 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine separately whether, in this case, there has also been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Ezel Tosun v. Turkey, no. 33379/02, \u00a7 28, 10 January 2006).\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. Regarding a just-satisfaction award, the applicant set out his claims in the application form lodged on 28 September 2005, but failed to comply with Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, as well as Article 5 of the related Practice Direction. Therefore the Court considers that there is no call to award any sum in the present case on that account (see Mar\u010di\u0107 and Others v. Serbia, no. 17556/05, \u00a7 63, 30 October 2007).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine separately the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 October 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nRegistrar President", "001-90569": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF JANUSZ DUDEK v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d), which entered into force on 17 September 2004, refer only to the judicial phase of the proceedings. The investigation phase of criminal proceedings is excluded from the scope of the 2004 Act.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n14. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination .... of any criminal charge against him ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n16. The period to be taken into consideration began on 23 October 2003 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted over five years and the proceedings are still at the investigation phase.\n#### A. Admissibility\n17. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The Government\n18. Relying on arguments related to the high degree of complexity of the case, and the number of suspects and witnesses that had to be heard, the Government submitted that the national authorities displayed due diligence in ensuring the proper examination of the case. They further noted that the length of the investigation had been partly attributable to the applicant who \u201cexcessively\u201d exercised his procedural rights and lodged numerous appeals against many decisions in the course of proceedings.\n(b) The applicant\n19. The applicant submitted that the length of proceedings against him was unreasonable. He also maintained that he had been suspended from his professional duties for a long time and could not support his family and therefore had to apply for early retirement.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n20. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n21. The Court admits that the case is indeed complicated in terms of the number of suspects and witnesses to be heard. However, the complexity of the case is not such as to lead to the investigation lasting five years without an indictment or the beginning of judicial proceedings in sight.\n22. The Court likewise cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the length of proceedings is in a considerable part attributable to the applicant, who on numerous occasions appealed against the decisions extending the preventive measure imposed on him or requested the courts to lift or replace it by some other, less severe preventive measure. The Court considers that the normal use of an applicant\u2019s procedural rights, without the appearance of overusing them or lodging numerous manifestly ill-founded or trivial requests, cannot lead to the conclusion that the responsibility for the excessive length of proceedings is attributable to the applicant (see, by contrast, Malicka-W\u0105sowska no. 41413/98 (dec.) and Buchholz v. Germany, judgment of 6 May 1981, Series A no. 42, pp. 21-22, \u00a7 63). The Court observes that the duty to administer justice expeditiously is incumbent in the first place on the authorities, especially as during the substantial part of the investigation a preventive measure aiming at securing the proper course of the proceedings was applied to the applicant (see, mutatis mutandis, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 130, ECHR 2000\u2011XI).\n23. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n24. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicant also complained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention that his arrest on 4 November 2003 had been arbitrary and unnecessary.\n26. The Court notes that this complaint was lodged outside the six\u2011month time limit. It must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n28. The applicant claimed 300,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in respect of pecuniary, non-pecuniary damage and costs and expenses.\n29. The Government contested these claims.\n30. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicant\u2019s general claim of PLN 300,000 also included a claim for costs and expenses. However, it is not clear what costs and expenses the applicant has actually incurred and whether his claim concerns costs in the proceedings before the domestic courts or those incurred before the Court. The applicant produced an invoice for PLN 2,400 for \u201clegal assistance\u201d, issued by a lawyer who represented him in the domestic proceedings. It is unclear whether the invoice in fact concerns the domestic proceedings complained of.\n32. The Government did not express an opinion on the matter.\n33. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 150 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n34. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention the following amounts to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of the settlement :\n(i) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(ii) EUR 150 (one hundred and fifty euros) in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 13 January 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-60694": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF FOLEY v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 September 2001 and 1 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained that the domestic proceedings were not concluded within a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, so far as material:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations (...), everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n28. The Government accepted that the relevant period for the purposes of the \u201creasonable time\u201d aspect of the complaint ran from 4 July 1984 until 19 April 1999, a total of fourteen years and nine and a half months. However, they submitted that, although the proceedings were unusually long, only a small proportion of the total delay could be attributed to the State.\nThus, they highlighted the fact that the proceedings were both factually and procedurally complex; the factual complexity was illustrated by, inter alia, the length of the trial, while the insolvency of the defendant companies during the appeal proceedings led to much greater procedural complexity before the Court of Appeal.\n29. The Government also argued that the applicant did not show sufficient diligence in his conduct of the proceedings. In the High Court, he caused delay by entering judgment in default despite knowing that the defendants were in the course of formulating their defence. The claim was vaguely drafted, necessitating a request for Further and Better Particulars, to which the applicant failed to respond in a timely manner. The Summons for Directions was served more than four years late, and the plaintiffs manifestly failed to fulfil their discovery obligations. Furthermore, there were periods in which the applicant took no steps at all to progress the case to trial, and he failed to avail himself in a timely manner of means provided to ensure that the defendants fulfilled their obligations in connection with the proceedings. The trial had to be adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s illness.\nIn the Court of Appeal, there was a delay of one year in providing the court with transcripts of evidence from the trial; to the extent that that delay was attributable to the court reporters, the Government submitted that the State could not be held responsible. The Government also pointed to the fact that the applicant consented to the appeal being stood out of the list following the entry into receivership of Ferranti plc.\n30. The Government referred to the applicant\u2019s allegations of use by the defendants of \u201cdelaying tactics\u201d in the proceedings, and submitted that the State\u2019s obligations in this regard were discharged by the presence of mechanisms allowing the applicant to take action to counter such tactics. The defendants\u2019 applications for security for costs, and their failure to apply to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution, also caused delay for which the Government could not be held responsible.\n31. As for the competent authorities, the Government contended that the High Court made provision for the various hearings required without significant or undue delay, while the Court of Appeal was blameworthy only for the period of delay between 25 March 1997 and 8 April 1998. They accepted that some files in connection with the action were lost by the CAO but submitted that the loss in no way delayed the hearing of the appeal. In the context of proceedings which took more than fourteen years in all, they argued that a delay of just over a year on the part of the competent authorities could not justify a finding of violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n##### 2. The applicant\n32. The applicant submitted that the length of the proceedings was such that, in itself, it gave rise to a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in Article 6 \u00a7 1. He did not consider that the proceedings were particularly complex. Delaying tactics were used by the defendants, but the competent authorities were responsible for more than five years of delay in all.\n33. In respect of his own conduct and that of his fellow plaintiff, the applicant contended that entry of judgment in default probably had the result of reducing the time taken by the defendants to lodge a Defence to the action. He was unaware of the importance of the Summons for Directions and the long delays in serving the plaintiffs\u2019 list of documents were due to their desire to provide their list only when that of the defendants was ready. His priority throughout the proceedings was to obtain justice in the shortest time possible and to avoid the financial costs of protracted legal proceedings. Although the trial had to be adjourned in June 1991 due to his illness, the fact that it was not resumed until April 1992 was largely due to there being insufficient court time available. The delay of nearly a year in lodging transcripts of the trial with the Court of Appeal was attributable to the official court reporters and thus imputable to the Government.\n34. The applicant alleged that the courts were guilty of significant delays in hearing various applications in the course of the proceedings, in particular, delays in the hearing of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal against the first award of security for costs in 1985, their application for an order requiring Further and Better Particulars of the Defence in 1986, and the various preliminary matters before the District Registrar and High Court in 1989 and early 1990. He stated also that no effort was made by the CAO to advise him at any time as to the conduct of the appeal following his letter of 18 June 1996 confirming that he would be proceeding with the appeal in person. The documentation was misplaced and the CAO was slow in determining the status of the defendants, and the investigation of his complaints about the CAO was ineffective. The CAO made no real effort to progress the appeal until June 1998.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s conclusion\n35. The proceedings in the present case commenced on 4 July 1984, when the applicant and the plaintiff company issued a writ against the two defendant companies. The proceedings were not concluded until 19 April 1999, fourteen years, nine and a half months later, when the plaintiffs were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.\n36. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the parties\u2019 conduct and that of the competent authorities, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among many other authorities, the Gast and Popp v. Germany judgment of 25 February 2000, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2000-II, \u00a7 70).\n37. The Court considers that the proceedings were both factually and procedurally complex, as demonstrated by the fact that the first instance trial lasted over six weeks (see paragraph 19 above). The subsequent administrative receivership of Ferranti in 1993, moreover, inevitably led to some delay in the appeal proceedings (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). These matters reduce the period of time for which the respondent State can be held accountable under Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n38. In addition, the Court is of the view that the majority of the delays were attributable to the conduct of the parties to the proceedings or of third parties for which the State is not responsible. For example, the plaintiffs failed to comply with the deadline for serving a list of documents, which expired on 3 January 1985, and the defendants did not apply for an order requiring discovery until 21 May 1987 (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, the plaintiffs were almost four years late in serving the Summons for Directions in the action (see paragraph 16 above). Another delay of almost a year was caused by the slowness of the court reporters, a private company, in producing a transcript of the material evidence adduced at the first instance trial, which the plaintiffs were required to lodge with the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 20 above).\n39. Nonetheless, certain periods of delay can clearly be attributed to the conduct of the State authorities. The following deficiencies are particularly noteworthy:\n(1) the failure to hear in a timely manner the applicant\u2019s appeal against the Order dated 26 September 1985 requiring him to provide security for the defendants\u2019 costs. According to the applicant, the appeal was due to be heard in October 1985 but had to be postponed until the end of January 1986 (three months\u2019 delay) due to errors by the court registry (see paragraphs 12-13 above). This account has not been denied by the Government;\n(2) the failure by the District Registrar to hold a timely hearing on the Summons for Directions, an application by the applicant for discovery and an application by the defendants for further security for costs, all of which were lodged in February 1989, or at least to refer them more quickly to the High Court (see paragraph 17 above). The hearing due for 7 April 1989 was adjourned, and a subsequent hearing proposed for 1 September was also adjourned. At the hearing of 25 October the District Registrar decided to adjourn again, in order to refer the matters before him to the High Court, which held hearings on 15, 17 and 24 January 1990 (eleven months\u2019 delay in all, although the Government submit that the first adjournment was caused by the parties\u2019 inaccurate time estimate);\n(3) the decision to list the trial for commencement on 4 June 1991 even though the parties had indicated in February 1990 that they would be prepared for trial from 1 October 1990 (see paragraph 18 above). The trial was then adjourned on 18 June due to the applicant being unwell, but it was not recommenced until 29 April 1992 (eighteen months after the parties had first been ready);\n(4) delays in progressing the appeal between November 1996 and March 1997 (four months) due to attempts by the CAO to ascertain the defendants\u2019 status, even though that Office seems to have already known the position as a result of inquiries made in 1995 and 1996 (see paragraph 23 above);\n(5) the failure by the CAO to list the appeal, and organise associated matters, between March 1997 and April 1998 (thirteen months\u2019 delay; see paragraphs 23 and 24 above). It is significant in this connection that the Court Service\u2019s Customer Service Unit wrote to the applicant on 21 October 1998 acknowledging that there had been \u201csignificant delay\u201d in listing the hearing (even though it did not accept responsibility) and that the applicant had not been kept sufficiently aware of the progress of his case (see paragraph 25 above).\n40. The Court notes that in England and Wales it is to a large extent for the parties to civil proceedings to see that each step in the proceedings follows within a reasonable time, and there are a number of procedural tools which are available to each party to prevent excessive delay on the part of the other. However, the domestic courts retain an obligation to ensure compliance with the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, the Scopelliti v. Italy judgment of 23 November 1993, Series A no. 278, \u00a7 25).\n41. The Court concludes, in the light of this principle, that the overall length of the proceedings, combined with the above-mentioned specific instances of delay attributable to the State, gave rise to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in this case.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n42. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary damage\n43. The applicant claimed the costs of the domestic proceedings, together with compound interest.\n44. The Government submitted, first, that the applicant was legally aided until May 1996, and so his costs up until that date had already been reimbursed. Once his legal aid certificate was discharged the applicant acted in person and did not, therefore, incur any legal costs. In any event, any legal costs and expenses incurred by the applicant during the domestic proceedings were not caused by the alleged violation of the Convention, and would have been incurred whether or not the proceedings had been determined within a reasonable time.\n45. The Court recalls the well-established principle underlying the provision of just satisfaction for a breach of Article 6, that the applicant should as far as possible be put in the position he would have enjoyed had the proceedings complied with the Convention\u2019s requirements. The Court will award monetary compensation under Article 41 only where it is satisfied that the loss or damage complained of was actually caused by the violation it has found, since the State cannot be required to pay damages in respect of losses for which it is not responsible (see Davies v. the United Kingdom, no. 42007/98, 16.07.02, \u00a7 34). It cannot be said that the pecuniary loss claimed by the applicant was attributable to the unreasonable length of the proceedings. The Court therefore rejects the claim under this head.\n#### B. Non-pecuniary damage\n46. In addition the applicant claimed GBP 275,000 in general and exemplary damages for suffering and distress caused by delay and maladministration.\n47. The Government submitted that the applicant had provided no firm evidence of any physical or emotional damage occasioned by the alleged unreasonable delay.\n48. The Court observes that some forms of non-pecuniary damage, including emotional distress, by their very nature cannot always be the object of concrete proof. This does not prevent the Court from making an award if it considers that it is reasonable to assume that an applicant has suffered injury requiring financial compensation (see the above-mentioned Davies judgment, \u00a7 38). In the present case, it is reasonable to assume that the applicant suffered distress, anxiety and frustration as a result of the delays found by the Court to have been attributable to the State (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above). The Court awards EUR 4,000 under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n49. The applicant was not represented in the proceedings before the Court of Human Rights, but claimed for the time he spent in pursuit of his application at the rate of GBP 20 an hour. In addition he claimed for secretarial and photocopying disbursements. His total claim under this head amounted to GBP 12,427.\n50. The Government submitted that the sums claimed were notional, and not legal costs actually incurred by the applicant.\n51. The Court observes that although the applicant did not incur any legal costs in his application to the Court, he must necessarily have incurred certain expenses, such as postage and photocopying. It therefore awards EUR 500 under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n52. The Court considers that the default interest should be fixed at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,000 (four thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 500 (five hundred euros) in respect of expenses, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable on the date of settlement;\n(b) that simple interest at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 22 October 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 September 1999 and 10 January 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n9. Section 4 of the Bail Act 1976 as amended (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) provided that a person accused of a criminal offence should be granted bail except as stated in Schedule 1 to the Act. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 provided that a defendant need not be granted bail if the court was satisfied that there were substantial grounds for believing that the defendant, if released on bail, would fail to surrender to custody, commit an offence while on bail or\ninterfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to himself or any other person.\n10. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, in taking the above decision, the court was to have regard to such of the following considerations, as well as to any other considerations, as appeared to that court to be relevant:\n\u2013 the nature and seriousness of the offence or default (and the probable method of dealing with the defendant for it);\n\u2013 the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant;\n\u2013 the defendant\u2019s record as regards the fulfilment of his obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; and\n\u2013 except in the case of a defendant whose case was adjourned for inquiries or a report, the strength of the evidence of his having committed the offence or having defaulted.\n11. According to paragraph 9A of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, if a defendant (who had been charged with murder, manslaughter, rape, attempted murder or attempted rape) was granted bail and representations had been made as regards the matters mentioned in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1, the court had to state its reasons for granting bail and cause those reasons to be included in the record of the proceedings.\n12. Section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) came into force on 10 April 1995 and provided as follows:\n\u201c(1) A person who in any proceedings has been charged with or convicted of an offence to which this section applies and in circumstances to which it applies shall not be granted bail in those proceedings.\n(2) This section applies, subject to subsection (3) below, to the following offences, ... \u2013\n(a) murder;\n(b) attempted murder;\n(c) manslaughter;\n(d) rape; or\n(e) attempted rape.\n(3) This section applies to a person charged with or convicted of any such offence only if he has been previously convicted by or before a court in any part of the United Kingdom of any such offence or of culpable homicide and, in the case of a previous conviction of manslaughter or culpable homicide, if he was then sentenced to imprisonment or, if he was then a child or young person, to long-term detention under any of the relevant enactments.\n\u2026\u201d\n13. Section 25 of the 1994 Act has been amended by section 56 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which entered into force on 30 September 1998. Section 56 of the 1998 Act reads as follows:\n\u201cIn subsection (1) of section 25 of the 1994 Act (no bail for defendants charged with or convicted of homicide or rape after previous conviction of such offences), for the words \u2018shall not be granted bail in those proceedings\u2019 there shall be substituted the words \u2018shall be granted bail in those proceedings only if the court or, as the case may be, the constable considering the grant of bail is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances which justify it\u2019.\u201d\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n14. Mr Caballero applied to the Commission on 28 June 1996. He alleged that the automatic denial of bail prior to his trial constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention both taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13. He also claimed that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3.\n15. The Commission declared the application (no. 32819/96) admissible on 1 December 1997. In its report of 30 June 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion, by nineteen votes to twelve, that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and that it was not necessary also to consider the complaint under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. It also expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been no violation of Article 13. The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n16. The Government in their memorial conceded that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. The Government also submitted that, for the reasons set out in the Commission\u2019s report, they considered that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention and that no separate issue arose under Article 14.\n17. The applicant maintained his complaints under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention and under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. He did not pursue his complaint under Article 13 before the Court.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention\n18. The applicant claimed that the automatic denial of bail pending his trial pursuant to section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. He also complained that he did not have an enforceable right to compensation in this respect within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention.\n19. The relevant parts of Article 5 of the Convention read as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n...\n5. Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\u201d\n20. The majority of the Commission was of the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. In their memorial to the Court, the Government conceded that there had been a violation of those provisions.\n21. The Court accepts the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention in the present case, with the consequence that it is empowered to make an award of just satisfaction to the applicant under Article 41, but it does not consider it necessary in the particular circumstances to examine the issues of interpretation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 raised by the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n### II. alleged violation of Article 13 of the Convention\n22. The applicant contended before the Commission that he did not have an effective domestic remedy in relation to the breaches of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. Article 13 reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n23. The Commission was of the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Government supported this conclusion before the Court, relying on the reasons set out in the Commission\u2019s report.\n24. The applicant did not pursue this complaint at all before the Court, which sees no cause to examine it of its own motion.\n### III. alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention\n25. The applicant further submitted that section 25 of the 1994 Act constituted a discriminatory difference in treatment contrary to Article 14 of the Convention when taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. Article 14 reads as follows:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n26. The Commission found no necessity in the circumstances to examine this complaint. Before the Court, the Government agreed with this conclusion, again relying on the reasons outlined by the Commission in its report.\n27. The Court notes that section 25 of the 1994 Act operated by selecting certain accused persons to whom bail could not be granted prior to trial. In view of its acceptance of the Government\u2019s concession in connection with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 21 above), the Court does not find it necessary also to consider the applicant\u2019s complaint about section 25 of the 1994 Act under Article 14.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicant did not allege any pecuniary damage. However, he sought an unspecified amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage, arguing that a decision not to make such an award would strip Article 5 \u00a7 5 of any effectiveness. He also submitted an affidavit of a solicitor in the United Kingdom who has practised since 1985 exclusively in criminal law and advocacy in the criminal courts. The affidavit details why, according to\nthe deponent, the applicant would have had a good chance of being granted bail prior to his trial had section 25 of the 1994 Act not been in force. The Government did not comment on this claim.\n30. The Court recalls that in certain cases which concerned violations of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 it has made relatively small awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see the Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium judgment of 25 April 1983 (Article 50), Series A no. 63, p. 7, \u00a7 13, and the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 29, \u00a7 65). However, in more recent cases, it has declined to make any such award (see the Pauwels v. Belgium judgment of 26 May 1988, Series A no. 135, p. 20, \u00a7 46; the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 May 1989 (Article 50), Series A no. 152-B, pp. 44-45, \u00a7 9; the Huber v. Switzerland judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 188, p. 19, \u00a7 46; the Toth v. Austria judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, p. 24, \u00a7 91; the Kampanis v. Greece judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318-B, p. 49, \u00a7 66; Hood v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27267/95, \u00a7\u00a7 84-87; ECHR 1999-I; and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-II). In some of these judgments the Court stated that just satisfaction can be awarded only in respect of damage resulting from a deprivation of liberty that the applicant would not have suffered if he or she had had the benefit of the guarantees of Article 5 \u00a7 3 and concluded, according to the circumstances, that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non-pecuniary damage suffered.\n31. In the present case affidavit evidence, which is not disputed by the Government, was submitted by the applicant to the effect that, had it not been for section 25 of the 1994 Act, he would have had a good chance of being released on bail prior to his trial. The applicant further argued that any such release on bail prior to his trial could have been his last days of liberty given his advanced age, his ill-health and the long sentence he was serving, a submission on which the Government also did not comment. The Court awards the applicant, on an equitable basis, 1,000 pounds sterling (GBP) compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n32. The applicant claimed a total of GBP 32,225.09 in legal costs and expenses (this is inclusive of value-added tax (VAT), as are all figures noted below). This claim comprised the costs and expenses of two different legal representatives. Dundons (a firm of solicitors) liaised between the applicant and Liberty, and the latter represented the applicant before the Court. The applicant sought reimbursement of costs and expenses in the amount of GBP 5,910.56 as regards Dundons\u2019 work on the case and in the sum of GBP 11,935.47 in respect of Liberty\u2019s work. His claim also included counsel\u2019s fees in the amount of GBP 14,379.06. In addition, all costs and expenses claimed embraced those which the applicant anticipated would be incurred by his legal advisers after the submission of his memorial to the Court and up to the conclusion of the present procedure. However, by letter dated 3 September 1999, the applicant clarified that, as the anticipated costs and expenses related to any future hearing before this Court, that element could be discounted since no such hearing had taken place.\nThe Government argued that they should not be required to pay costs and expenses of two representatives and that, accordingly, the claim in respect of Dundons should be discounted. They also considered excessive the time for which counsel had billed. They further submitted that most of the anticipated costs and expenses requested should be discounted since, inter alia, the Government had conceded the violation of Article 5 of the Convention in their memorial and because no hearing had been held. The Government, accordingly, suggested a total award of GBP 12,000 in respect of costs and expenses.\n33. The Court recalls that in order for costs and expenses to be recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention, it must be established that they were actually and necessarily incurred, and reasonable as to quantum (see, among other authorities, Nikolova cited above, \u00a7 79).\nThe Court finds that there was considerable duplication between the work carried out by the applicant\u2019s two representatives and would reduce the amount claimed in respect of Dundons accordingly. In addition, the number of hours for which counsel charged appears to be excessively high. Furthermore, given that little input was required of the applicant\u2019s representatives after the submission of his memorial, the remaining request for reimbursement for anticipated costs must be significantly reduced. Considering the above, and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant GBP 15,250 inclusive of VAT but less the amount received in legal aid from the Council of Europe (4,100 French francs).\n#### C. Default interest\n34. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT unanimously\n1. Accepts the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that it is not necessary to consider whether there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to consider whether there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, the following amounts:\n(i) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, GBP 1,000 (one thousand pounds sterling);\n(ii) for costs and expenses, GBP 15,250 (fifteen thousand two hundred and fifty pounds sterling) inclusive of value-added tax, less the amount received in legal aid from the Council of Europe;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 7.5% shall be payable on those sums from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and in French, and notified in writing on 8 February 2000, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLuzius Wildhaber\nPresident\nPaul Mahoney\nDeputy Registrar\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) concurring opinion of Mrs Palm joined by Mr Bonello, Mrs Tulkens and Sir Robert Carnwath;\n(b) separate opinion of Mr Casadevall joined by Mrs Greve.\n#### L.W.\nP.J.M.\nconcurring opinion of judge palm\njoined by judges bonello, tulkens\nand sir Robert carnwath\n1. In paragraph 21 of the judgment the Court \u201caccepts the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention in the present case, with the consequence that it is empowered to make an award of just satisfaction to the applicant under Article 41, but it does not consider it necessary in the particular circumstances to examine the issues of interpretation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 raised by the applicant\u2019s complaint\u201d.\n2. I agree that in a case like the present one where the respondent State concedes that there has been a violation and where the national legislation or practice has been changed accordingly, and where in addition the Court is satisfied that there is no reason of public policy to fix the case-law for the future and for all Contracting States, the Court may discharge the duty conferred on it by Article 19 of the Convention \u2013 namely \u201c[t]o ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols thereto\u201d \u2013 by accepting the Government\u2019s concession without itself going into any undecided general issues of interpretation raised by the case. Such an approach is in the interest of procedural economy as, in my view, it enables the Court to proceed, without further reasoning, to rule on the applicant\u2019s contested claims for just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention.\n3. To be able to make an award of just satisfaction, the Court must, under the terms of Article 41, find a violation of at least one substantive Article and it must, in accordance with Article 45, give reasons for its judgment.\n4. In the present case, the Court\u2019s reasons for finding a violation are precisely that the Government have conceded a violation, having moreover already amended the legislation at the root of the applicant\u2019s complaint, and that in the particular circumstances there is no call to examine the interpretative question of general application raised by the case.\n5. The operative part of the judgment, however, appears to leave it open whether there was a violation in the present case, the Court merely holding that it \u201caccepts the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention\u201d. I find this formulation unfortunate as it makes the judgment unclear as to the Court\u2019s position. In so far as this formulation is not tantamount to a finding of a violation, it\nintroduces a new form of judgment which rules in favour neither of a violation nor of a non-violation and which yet makes an award of just satisfaction under the Article 41. This must be seen as an extension of the Court\u2019s competence according to the Convention.\n6. The logic of accepting the Government\u2019s concession of a violation while refraining from settling an unresolved issue of interpretation must, to my mind, be that the Court also accepts that there was a violation in, and for the purposes of, the particular case. The operative part ought to have spelt this out explicitly. In short, in my view, when minded to accept a concession by a respondent State of a violation and to make an award of just satisfaction under Article 41, the Court may leave open for resolution another day a general question of interpretation of the Convention \u2013 provided of course that there are no reasons of public policy dictating otherwise \u2013 but it may not leave open whether there was a violation of the relevant substantive Article(s) in the particular case.\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE CASADEVALL\njoIned by Judge greve\n(Translation)\n1. I share the view put forward by the Government in their memorial that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention, and the applicant should consequently be awarded just satisfaction. However, I must in this instance express my strong reservations about the new approach adopted by the Court in this judgment in paragraph 21 and in the first point of the operative provisions.\n2. If it was not going to strike the case out of its list on account of a friendly settlement or for any other reason provided for in Article 37, the Court had a duty, in the exercise of its jurisdiction \u201cconcerning the interpretation and application of the Convention\u201d, in the words of Article 32, to rule on the merits and hold that there had been \u2013 or had not been \u2013 a violation of the provisions in question. In my view, those are the only two options available to the Court under the Convention.\n3. It is apparent from Article 41 that an award of just satisfaction is subject to a prior finding that there has been a violation of the Convention or its Protocols. That being so, even allowing the Court a wide discretion to interpret that provision, I am not persuaded that the fact that the Court has accepted the Government\u2019s concession enables it, in itself, to award such satisfaction.\n4. Even if the State conceded that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5, the applicant (the only master of the litigation) maintained his complaint in the absence of a friendly settlement. He was accordingly entitled to a reasoned judgment on the merits (as required by Article 45) and not merely an acceptance of the Government\u2019s concession, and the Court, in my opinion, should have determined the questions before it.\n5. Although the precedent dates from 1978 and is admittedly not binding on the new Court, I prefer the point of view expressed in the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment (18 January 1978, Series A no. 25) inasmuch as the Court \u201cconsider[ed] that the responsibilities assigned to it within the framework of the system under the Convention extend[ed] to pronouncing on the non-contested allegations of [a] violation ...\u201d (p. 62, \u00a7 154) and \u201cAccordingly, that part of the present case which concerns the said allegations cannot be said to have become without object; the Court considers that it should rule thereon, notwithstanding the initiatives taken by the respondent State\u201d (p. 62, \u00a7 155).\n6. Although it can be argued that the Court always retains the right to continue the examination of a case, even if there is a friendly settlement or the applicant withdraws his complaints (Article 37), the opening up of this \u201cnew third way\u201d, confined to a mere acceptance of a concession by the respondent State, does not seem to me to be satisfactory in either spirit or letter, in the light of the wording of the Convention.", "001-79398": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KRZYCH AND GURBIERZ v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n20. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005\u2011V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005\u2011V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 6 \u00a7 1 AND 7 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n21. The applicants first complained that the proceedings in their case had been unfair. In particular, they alleged that the courts had committed errors of fact and law. This complaint falls to be examined under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n22. The Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.\n23. In the present case the applicants did not allege any particular failure to respect his right to a fair hearing on the part of the relevant courts. Indeed, their complaints are limited to a challenge to their allegedly wrongful conviction. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court finds no indication that the impugned proceedings were conducted unfairly.\nIt follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill\u2011founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF PROCEEDINGS\n24. The applicants complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n25. The Government contested that argument.\n26. The applicants submitted that they had been charged on 16 December 1993. The Government did not contest that date. However, they submitted that the proceedings at issue started on 18 October1994 when the first hearing took place. Having regard to its extensive case\u2011law on the subject, the Court considers that the period to be taken into consideration began on 16 December 1993 when the applicants were charged, and ended on 21 February 2005 when the Gliwice Regional Court dismissed their appeal. It thus lasted 11 years, 2 months and 9 days for two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n27. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicants and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999\u2011II)\n29. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above). Furthermore, the Court considers that, in dismissing the applicants\u2019 complaint that the proceedings in their case had exceeded a reasonable time, the Katowice Court of Appeal failed to apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in the Court\u2019s case-law (see Majewski v. Poland, no. 52690/99, \u00a7 36, 11 October 2005).\n30. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n32. The applicants claimed in total over 700,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) in respect of pecuniary damage. They also claimed PLN 54,000 each in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n33. The Government contested their claims.\n34. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards each of the applicants 6,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n35. The applicants also claimed over PLN 80,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and before the Court.\n36. The Government contested these claims.\n37. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award to each of the two applicants, who were not represented by a lawyer, the sum of EUR 100 covering costs under all heads.\n#### C. Default interest\n38. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay each applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Polish zlotys at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 100 (one hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above\u2011mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 13 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n15. The Government submitted that the case should be struck out of the Court's list of cases on the ground that the applicant's family were not affected by the alleged violations and could therefore not claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.\n16. The Court reiterates that in a number of cases in which an applicant died in the course of the proceedings, it has taken account of the statements of the applicants' heirs or close family members expressing their wish to pursue the case before the Court (see, among many other authorities, Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Latif Fuat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey, no. 54673/00, \u00a7 27, 2 February 2006; Mutlu v. Turkey, no. 8006/02, \u00a7\u00a7 13\u201314, 10 October 2006). In the present case the Court considers that, apart from having explicitly expressed their wish to do so, the applicant's family have sufficient legitimate interests in obtaining a ruling that the length of the applicant's detention pending trial and the criminal proceedings against him was excessive, in breach of Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. In view of the above, the Court holds that the applicant's family has standing to continue the present proceedings in the applicant's stead. Consequently, the Government's objection that the case should be struck out is dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that his detention pending trial had exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. With reference to the ruling of the Court in its Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece judgment (cited above), they contended that the applicant had not raised his complaint before the domestic courts.\n21. The applicant denied the Government's allegations.\n22. The Court notes that, on various occasions during the proceedings, the applicant expressly complained about the length of his detention pending trial and unsuccessfully requested the trial court to release him. Against this background the Court finds that the applicant must be considered to have complied with Article 35 \u00a7 1. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government's objection.\n23. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant's detention pending trial had complied with domestic law. In view of the seriousness of the charges brought against him and the evidence in the case file, the court had prolonged that detention.\n25. The Court notes that, in the instant case, the period to be taken into consideration began on 7 March 1994 with the applicant's arrest and ended on 5 April 2004, when the applicant was released pending trial. It thus lasted nearly 10 years and 1 month. During this period, the domestic courts prolonged the applicant's detention on remand using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the duration of detention\u201d.\n26. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v.

Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant's detention pending trial was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n28. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained of a breach of the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n30. The Government contested that allegation.\n31. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration began on 7 March 1994 when the applicant was taken into police custody. In the absence of any information in the case file as to whether, and if so when, the domestic courts decided to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the applicant after his death, the Court cannot determine the exact length of the period in question. However proceedings were pending at the time of the applicant's death on 14 June 2005 and had thus already lasted some eleven years and three months for one level of jurisdiction at that point.\n#### A. Admissibility\n32. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, and the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999\u2011II).\n34. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present application (ibid.).\n35. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present application. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n37. Muhteber \u00dctebay, \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay and Ercan \u00dctebay claimed 20,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n38. The Government contested the claim.\n39. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violations found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it accepts that the applicant must have suffered some non-pecuniary damage which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation alone. Consequently, taking into account the circumstances of the case and having regard to its case-law, the Court awards the applicant EUR 14,000 for non-pecuniary damage, to be paid jointly to his successors, Muhteber \u00dctebay, \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay and Ercan \u00dctebay.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n40. Muhteber \u00dctebay, \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay and Ercan \u00dctebay also claimed EUR 7,000 for legal fees and costs and expenses.\n41. The Government contested this claim.\n42. Since no substantiation of this claim has been submitted, as required by Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, the Court makes no award under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n43. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay Muhteber \u00dctebay, \u0130yasettin \u00dctebay and Ercan \u00dctebay, jointly, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 14,000 (fourteen thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of the settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 17 July 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSally Doll\u00e9 Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens Registrar President", "001-78429": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DEPA v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n26. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so\u2011called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 5 provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning the prolongation of detention on remand.\n27. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000\u2011XI, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23, 4 May 2006.\n28. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that the length of his detention on remand had been unreasonable. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n30. The Government refrained from expressing an opinion on whether the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3. The Government submitted, however, that his pre-trial detention was duly justified and that during the entire period the authorities had given relevant and sufficient reasons for prolonging it. Moreover, the Government argued that the domestic courts had acted diligently and speedily, particularly in view of the complexity of the case, which had involved several co\u2011accused.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n32. Under the Court\u2019s case-law, the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in abstracto. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254\u2011A, p. 15, \u00a7 30, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000\u2011XI)\n33. The presumption is in favour of release. As established in Neumeister v. Austria (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 37, \u00a7 4), the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give the judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-...).\n34. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see McKay, cited above, \u00a7 43).\n35. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000\u2011IV, and Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000).\n##### 2. Application of the principles to the circumstances of the present case\n36. The Court first notes that the applicant had been detained on remand on 14 January 1998 and that the first-instance judgment was given on 10 January 2000. Subsequently, on 13 April 2000, the appeal court quashed the judgment and remitted the case. The applicant\u2019s detention on remand lasted until 6 February 2002 when the trial court again convicted him. Moreover, the period between 27 March and 11 August 1998 should be deducted from the overall period of his detention as during this time the applicant had been serving a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings. The detention thus lasted 3 years and 5 months.\n37. The Court observes that in the present case the authorities relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the severity of the sentence that might be imposed. They repeated those grounds in all their decisions. The authorities failed to advance any other justifications to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention.\n38. The Court accepts that the suspicion against the applicant of having committed the offences and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings might initially justify his detention. However, with the passage of time, these grounds became less relevant and cannot justify the entire period of 3 years and 5 months during which the most serious preventive measure against the applicant had been imposed (see Malik v. Poland, no. 57477/00, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2006).\n39. Moreover, the authorities relied heavily on the likelihood that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant given the serious nature of the offences at issue. In this respect, the Court agrees that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80\u201181, 26 July 2001).\n40. The Court further observes that the applicant was detained on charges of, inter alia, attempted homicide and was finally convicted of causing bodily harm. Moreover, even though the applicant had committed these crimes with the help of accomplices, there is no indication that he was a member of an organised criminal group. It does not appear therefore that his case presented particular difficulties for the investigation authorities and for the courts to determine the facts and mount a case against the perpetrator as would undoubtedly have been the case had the proceedings concerned organised crime (see Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7 37, 4 May 2006; Dudek v. Poland, no. 633/03, \u00a7 36, 4 May 2006).\n41. Finally, the Court would emphasise that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the authorities, when deciding whether a person is to be released or detained, are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at the trial. Indeed, that Article lays down not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or release pending trial\u201d but also provides that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Jablonski, cited above, \u00a7 83).\nIn the present case the Court notes that there is no express indication that during the entire period of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention the authorities envisaged any other means of guaranteeing his appearance at trial. Nor did they give any consideration to the possibility of ensuring his presence at trial by imposing on him other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d expressly foreseen by Polish law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings.\n42. The Court is, therefore, not satisfied that the reasons given to justify the applicant\u2019s detention for 3 years and 5 months were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, as required under Article 5 \u00a7 3.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n43. The applicant complained about the procedure relating to the prolongation of his pre-trial detention, in particular that he and his lawyer did not attend the sessions at which his detention was prolonged. The Court will examine this complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n44. The Government submitted that according to Article 249 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the lawyer of the accused was notified of the court\u2019s sessions at which detention on remand was prolonged and was entitled to take part in them. The Government maintained that the applicant\u2019s lawyers were summoned to those sessions, although they were absent from some of them. The Government submitted that, taking into consideration all the proceedings devoted to the review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention, the principles guaranteed in Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention had been respected in the present case.\n45. The Court reiterates the following principles which emerge from the Court\u2019s case law on Article 5 \u00a7 4, so far as relevant in the present case:\n(a) Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention entitles an arrested or detained person to institute proceedings bearing on the procedural and substantive conditions which are essential for the \u201clawfulness\u201d, in Convention terms, of their deprivation of liberty (see, among many others, Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145\u2011B, pp. 34-35, \u00a7 65).\n(b) Although it is not always necessary that the procedure under Article 5 \u00a7 4 be attended by the same guarantees as those required under Article 6 of the Convention for criminal or civil litigation, it must have a judicial character and provide guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see, for instance, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, p. 3302, \u00a7 162, and W\u0142och v. Poland, no. 27785/95, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2000-XI, both with reference to Megyeri v. Germany, judgment of 12 May 1992, Series A no. 237-A, p. 11, \u00a7 22).\n(c) The proceedings must be adversarial and must always ensure \u201cequality of arms\u201d between the parties. In the case of a person whose detention falls within the ambit of Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) a hearing is required (see Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999\u2011II; Assenov and Others, cited above, \u00a7 162, with references to Schiesser v. Switzerland, judgment of 4 December 1979, Series A no. 34, p. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 30\u201131; Sanchez\u2011Reisse v. Switzerland, judgment of 21 October 1986, Series A no. 107, p. 19, \u00a7 51; and Kampanis v. Greece, judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318-B, p. 45, \u00a7 47).\n(d) Furthermore, Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires that a person detained on remand be able to take proceedings at reasonable intervals to challenge the lawfulness of his detention (see Assenov and Others, cited above, p. 3302, \u00a7 162, with a reference to Bezicheri v. Italy, judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 164, pp. 10-11, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21).\n46. Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court firstly notes that it cannot examine events complained of by the applicant which took place before 26 November 1998, that is more than six months before the date on which this complaint was submitted to the Court.\n47. The procedure for the prolongation of the applicant\u2019s pre\u2011trial detention during the period under consideration was based on Article 249 \u00a7 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which requires the domestic courts to inform the lawyer of a detained person of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision was to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand, or an appeal against a decision to impose or to prolong detention on remand was to be considered. It was open to the lawyer to attend such sessions.\n48. The Court observes that the majority of decisions to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention were given at public hearings at which the applicant was present and was legally represented. He was therefore able to personally support his applications for release.\nAs regards the remaining sessions at which his detention was prolonged, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s lawyers were properly summoned to and were present at the great majority of those sessions. They were also present at the examination of most of the applicant\u2019s numerous requests for release and appeals against the decisions to prolong the detention. In this connection the Court reiterates that in cases where characteristics pertaining to the applicant\u2019s personality and level of maturity and reliability are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 \u00a7 4 requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation (see Waite v. the United Kingdom, no. 53236/99, \u00a7 59, 10 December 2002). The Court considers, however, that in the present case the questions of assessment of the applicant\u2019s character or mental state did not arise. His personal attendance at all of the sessions at which his detention on remand had been prolonged was therefore not required, and the presence of his lawyers ensured respect for equality of arms in those proceedings.\n49. In view of the above, the Court is of the opinion that the proceedings in which the prolongation of his detention was examined satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4 (see Telecki v. Poland, (dec.), no. 56552/00, 3 July 2003 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7 47, 4 May 2006).\n50. It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being manifestly ill\u2011founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n51. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the length of the criminal proceedings had exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d within the meaning of this provision and that he had not had a \u201cfair trial\u201d.\n52. However, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law...\u201d\n53. As regards the complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings, the Court observes that the present application was lodged with the Court when the relevant proceedings were pending before the domestic courts.\n54. It further observes that, pursuant to section 18 of the 2004 Act, it was open to an applicant whose case was pending before the Court to lodge, within six months from 17 September 2004, a complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings with the relevant domestic court, provided that his application to the Court had been lodged in the course of the impugned proceedings and had not yet been declared admissible. The applicant in the present case satisfied these requirements.\n55. The Court has already examined that remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and found it effective in respect of complaints about the excessive length of judicial proceedings in Poland. In particular, it considered that it was capable both of preventing the alleged violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time or its continuation, and of providing adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred (see Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, ECHR 2005\u2011V).\n56. However, the applicant, despite having been informed by the Registrar of the possibility of lodging a complaint about the length of the proceedings under the 2004 Act, has chosen not to avail himself of this remedy. It follows that this complaint must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n57. With regard to the applicant\u2019s assertion that the proceedings in his case were unfair, the Court notes that it is not clear whether the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. However, even assuming that the applicant had exhausted domestic remedies, the Court reiterates that it is not called upon to deal with errors of fact and law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention (see Garc\u00eda Ruiz v. Spain [GC], no. 30544/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 1999-I).\n58. The Court observes that the applicant does not allege any particular failure to respect his right to a fair hearing. Assessing the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a whole, it finds no indication that they were unfairly conducted.\nIt follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\nIV APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n59. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n60. The applicant did not submit any claim in respect of just satisfaction or costs and expenses. Accordingly, the Court considers that there is no call to award him any sum on that account.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the unreasonable length of the applicant\u2019s detention on remand admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 December 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, 9 July 2013.\n10. As regards the discretion of the Secretary of State for Justice to release a prisoner sentenced to a whole life order, section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201csection 30\u201d) provides that he may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds. The criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued by the Secretary of State as Prison Service Order 4700 in April 2010.\nChapter 12 of the Lifer Manual, where relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe criteria for compassionate release on medical grounds for all indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISP) are as follows:\n\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stroke;\nand\n\u2022 the risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\n\u2022 further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\n\u2022 there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\n\u2022 early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family.\u201d\n[underlining in the original]\n11. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State, as a public authority, is bound to act compatibly with the scheduled Convention rights, including Article 3. Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act, legislation is to be interpreted so far as it is possible to do so compatibly with the Convention.\n12. A summary of the existing domestic case-law relating to the compatibility of the whole life order scheme with Article 3 of the Convention, notably the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes and Others and the House of Lords judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, was set out in Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58.\n13. The Grand Chamber delivered its judgment in Vinter and Others on 9 July 2013. For reasons discussed in more detail below, it held that there had been a violation of Article 3 in relation to the whole life orders imposed on the applicants because, given the lack of clarity in domestic law concerning the existence of an Article 3-compliant review mechanism, it appeared that the sentences were irrreducible. Following the Vinter and Others judgment, a special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge, to consider three appeals by defendants on whom whole life orders had been imposed and a reference by the Attorney-General in a case where it was contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in this case, R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim 188 was delivered on 18 February 2014. On the question whether whole life orders were reducible and thus compliant with Article 3, the Court of Appeal held:\n\u201c25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of s.30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under s.30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u2018At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u2019\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of s.30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u2018The fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his s.30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to s.30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u2019\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that s.30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u2018At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under s.30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.\u2019\n29. We disagree. In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to \u2018possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners\u2019. As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to exercise his power under s.30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.\n30. As we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence. It is important, therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is.\n31. First, the power of review under the section arises if there are exceptional circumstances. The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that although the whole life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances have since arisen. It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; the term \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 is of itself sufficiently certain.\n32. Second, the Secretary of State must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds. The policy set out in the Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will be considered by the Secretary of State. The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds. He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the Lifer Manual. In the passages in Hindley to which we have referred at paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions of s.30 of the 1997 Act require the Secretary of State to take in to account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds.\n33. Third, the term \u2018compassionate grounds\u2019 must be read, as the court made clear in R v Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3. They are not restricted to what is set out in the Lifer Manual. It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis.\n34. Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review.\n35. In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender \u2018hope\u2019 or the \u2018possibility\u2019 of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\n36. It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable. We find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life. But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases. The interpretation of s.30 we have set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of exceptional release.\nConclusion\n37. Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the [Criminal Justice Act] 2003 and in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 21. Although we were told by [counsel for the Secretary of State] that it might be many years before the applications might be made under s.30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would no discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that his whole life order violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n15. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 arguments\n16. The applicant submitted that his case was indistinguishable from Vinter and Others, cited above. The clarification offered by the Court of Appeal in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin was in substance identical to that set out in the earlier Court of Appeal judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes, which were considered by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others before it came to a finding of violation. Moreover, the applicant argued that the Convention was a living instrument and that there was a rapidly developing international consensus that the review of whole life orders required a judicial or quasi-judicial decision, rather than the decision of a Government Minister. The views expressed by the Secretary of State for Justice on the subject of whole life orders demonstrated that there was no realistic prospect of a fair, balanced and certain system under political control, and judicial review was no remedy for this, since it provided a review of process and not of substance. The reviewing court could examine whether the Secretary of State\u2019s decision was taken on improper grounds or was so unreasonable that no reasonable politician could have made it, but it was not open to the court to impose its own solution. In conclusion, in the applicant\u2019s submission, a mechanism \u201cpieced together\u201d from an executive discretion, a statutory provision limited to compassionate grounds and supervised at a distance by judicial review was too uncertain, lacked clarity and offered too vague a hope of release to pass the standard set out in Vinter and Others.\n17. Prior to the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in R v.Newell; R v. McLoughlin, the Government recognised that the principles set out by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others (cited above) \u201cwould appear on their face to apply to this case\u201d and that they did not, therefore, consider themselves in a position to submit observations on the merits. However, after the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment the Government indicated that they wished to submit observations. They underlined that the judgment in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin was now the binding and authoritative statement of the law in England and Wales. In that judgment the Court of Appeal set out the operation of domestic law, finding that the Secretary of State\u2019s power to release under section 30 of the 2003 Act functioned in precisely the way which the Grand Chamber held was in principle sufficient to render a whole life order reducible and this was compatible with Article 3 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal was uniquely well placed to determine this issue and its judgment had put to rest any suggestion that domestic law was in any relevant respect unclear.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na. General principles relating to the need for a review mechanism in respect of whole life sentences\n18. It is well-established in the Court\u2019s case-law that a State\u2019s choice of a specific criminal justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at the European level, provided that the system does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention. Contracting States must remain free to impose life sentences on adult offenders for especially serious crimes such as murder: the imposition of such a sentence on an adult offender is not in itself prohibited by or incompatible with Article 3 or any other Article of the Convention. This is particularly so when such a sentence is not mandatory but is imposed by an independent judge after he or she has considered all of the mitigating and aggravating factors which are present in any given case (see Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 104-106).\n19. However, if the life sentence is as a matter of law or practice irreducible, this may raise an issue under Article 3 (see Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 97, ECHR 2008). In Vinter and Others, cited above, the Grand Chamber reviewed in detail the relevant considerations flowing from the Court\u2019s case-law and from recent comparative and international\u2011law trends in respect of life sentences (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104-18; see also \u00d6calan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03, 197/04, 6201/06 and 10464/07, \u00a7\u00a7 193-198, 18 March 2014; L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar v. Hungary, no. 73593/10, \u00a7\u00a7 46-53, 20 May 2014; Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, \u00a7\u00a7 245-246, ECHR 2014 (extracts). On that basis, because a prisoner could not be detained unless there were legitimate penological grounds for incarceration, it held that a life sentence could remain compatible with Article 3 of the Convention only if there was both a prospect of release and a possibility of review (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 109-10). The Court noted in particular that the balance between the justifications for incarceration, such as punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation, could shift in the course of the sentence and it was only by carrying out a review of the justification for continued detention at an appropriate point in the sentence that those factors or shifts could properly be evaluated. If a prisoner was incarcerated without any prospect of release and without the possibility of having his life sentence reviewed, there was the risk that he could never atone for his offence and that whatever he did in prison, however exceptional his progress towards rehabilitation, his punishment would remain fixed (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 111-12). The Court therefore held that it would be incompatible with human dignity \u2013 which lay at the very essence of the Convention system \u2013 forcefully to deprive a person of his freedom without striving towards his rehabilitation and providing him with the chance someday to regain that freedom (ibid., \u00a7 113). It went on to note that there was now clear support in European and international law for the principle that all prisoners, including those serving life sentences, be offered the possibility of rehabilitation and the prospect of release if that rehabilitation was achieved (ibid., \u00a7 114). While punishment remained one of the aims of imprisonment, the emphasis in European penal policy, as expressed in Rules 6, 102.1 and 103.8 of the European Prison Rules, Resolution 76(2) and Recommendations 2003(23) and 2003(22) of the Committee of Ministers, statements by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, and the practice of a number of Contracting States, and in international law, as expressed, inter alia, in Article 10 \u00a7 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the General Comment on that Article, was now on the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment, even in the case of life prisoners (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 115-18).\n20. Based on that analysis, the Grand Chamber established the following propositions in relation to life sentences:\n(a) In the context of a life sentence, Article 3 of the Convention must be interpreted as requiring reducibility of the sentence, in the sense of a review which allows the domestic authorities to consider whether any changes in the life prisoner are so significant, and such progress towards rehabilitation has been made in the course of the sentence, as to mean that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (ibid., \u00a7 119);\n(b) Having regard to the margin of appreciation which must be accorded to Contracting States in the matters of criminal justice and sentencing, it is not the Court\u2019s task to prescribe the form \u2013 executive or judicial \u2013 which that review should take, or to determine when that review should take place. However, the comparative and international law materials show clear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7 120);\n(c) Where domestic law does not provide for the possibility of such a review, a whole life sentence will not comply with Article 3 (ibid., \u00a7 121);\n(d) Although the requisite review is a prospective event necessarily subsequent to the passing of the sentence, a whole life prisoner should not be obliged to wait and serve an indeterminate number of years of his sentence before he can raise the complaint that the legal conditions attaching to his sentence fail to comply with the requirements of Article 3 in this regard, since this would be contrary both to legal certainty and to the general principles on victim status within the meaning of that term in Article 34 of the Convention. Furthermore, in cases where the sentence, on imposition, is irreducible under domestic law, it would be capricious to expect the prisoner to work towards his own rehabilitation without knowing whether, at an unspecified, future date, a mechanism might be introduced which would allow him, on the basis of that rehabilitation, to be considered for release. A whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 of the Convention on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration (ibid., \u00a7 122);\n21. It must be emphasised, however, that the fact that in practice a life sentence may be served in full does not make it irreducible. No Article 3 issue could arise if a life prisoner had the right under domestic law to be considered for release but this was refused, for example, on the ground that he or she continued to pose a danger to society (ibid., \u00a7 108).\nb. Whether the review mechanism available to the applicant is sufficient to comply with the requirements of Article 3\n22. The dispute between the parties in the present case centres on whether the Secretary of State\u2019s discretion to release a whole life prisoner under section 30 of the 2003 Act (see paragraph 10 above) is sufficient to make the whole life sentence imposed on the applicant legally and effectively reducible. In Vinter and Others, cited above, the Court held that, if section 30 were to be interpreted, in the light of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act, as imposing a duty on the Secretary of State to exercise his power of release if it could be shown that the prisoner\u2019s continued detention was no longer justified on penological grounds, as the Court of Appeal had held it should be in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes (see paragraph 12 above), this would, in principle, be consistent with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (ibid., \u00a7 125). However, the Court considered that there was a lack of clarity in the law (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 126). In particular, it held that the fact that, despite the two Court of Appeal judgments, the Secretary of State had not amended chapter 12 of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 10 above), which provided that release would be ordered only if the prisoner were terminally ill or physically incapacitated, gave rise to uncertainty as to whether the section 30 power would be exercised in a manner compliant with Article 3. In addition, the fact that the Lifer Manual had not been amended meant that prisoners subject to whole life orders derived from it only a partial picture of the exceptional conditions capable of leading to the exercise of the Secretary of State\u2019s power under section 30 (ibid., \u00a7 128).\n23. However, subsequent to the Court\u2019s consideration of section 30 in Vinter and Others (cited above) the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment in which it expressly responded to the concerns detailed in Vinter and Others (R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin: see paragraph 13 above). In R v. Newell; R v McLoughlin the Court of Appeal held that it was of no consequence that the Lifer Manual had not been revised, since it was clearly established in domestic law that the Secretary of State was bound to exercise his power under section 30 in a manner compatible with Article 3. If an offender subject to a whole life order could establish that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d had arisen subsequent to the imposition of the sentence, the Secretary of State had to consider whether such exceptional circumstances justified release on compassionate grounds. Regardless of the policy set out in the Lifer Manual, the Secretary of State had to consider all the relevant circumstances, in a manner compatible with Article 3. Any decision by the Secretary of State would have to be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and would be subject to judicial review, which would serve to elucidate the meaning of the terms \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d, as was the usual process under the common law. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal, domestic law therefore did provide to an offender sentenced to a whole life order hope and the possibility of release in the event of exceptional circumstances which meant that the punishment was no longer justified.\n24. The Court recalls that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see, amongst many other authorities, Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 and Others v. Serbia [GC], no. 17153/11, \u00a7 80, 25 March 2014; S\u00f6derman v. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, \u00a7 102, ECHR 2013; and Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999\u2011I). Moreover, the Court recalls that in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the law through judicial interpretation is a well-entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition (see, mutatis mutandis, C.R. v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 335\u2011C).\n25. In the circumstances of this case where, following the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in which it expressed doubts about the clarity of domestic law, the national court has specifically addressed those doubts and set out an unequivocal statement of the legal position, the Court must accept the national court\u2019s interpretation of domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Cooper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48843/99, \u00a7 125, ECHR 2003\u2011XII). Further, as the Grand Chamber observed in Vinter and Others, the power to release under section 30 of the 2003 Act, exercised in the manner delineated in the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in Bieber and Oakes, and now R. v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin, is sufficient to comply with the requirements of Article 3 (and compare, also, the review mechanisms accepted by the Court to be Article 3-compliant in Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100-105 [and] Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 257-261.\n26. In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 3 in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Declares by a majority, the complaint concerning Article 3 of the Convention admissible;\n2. Holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 February 2015, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Guido Raimondi\nDeputy Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva is annexed to this judgment.\nGR\nFA\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE KALAYDJIEVA\nI voted against the conclusion of the majority that the applicant\u2019s complaints are admissible in so far as they concern the compatibility of whole life sentences as such with Article 3 of the Convention. To the extent that these complaints concern the availability of de jure and de facto possibilities for release, their admissibility might be questionable in so far as it is unclear whether the applicant ever availed himself of the opportunity to apply to the Secretary of State for Justice in order to test the manner in which the latter would exercise his power to assess whether any exceptional circumstances justified the applicant\u2019s release. The applicant was entitled to do so at any time after 16 May 2008, when Tugendhat J found it \u201cright that the applicant should remain in prison for the rest of his life by way of punishment\u201d and ordered \u201cthat the early release provisions are not to apply to [him]\u201d.\nIt should be noted that Mr Hutchinson\u2019s application (no. 57592/08) was registered (one and two years respectively) earlier than those in the cases of Vinter and Others (nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10) which were examined by the Grand Chamber of this Court in 2013. To the extent that the majority in the present case considered the applicant\u2019s complaints admissible and identical to the ones in Vinter, I find no reasons to disagree with the observation of the respondent Government of 14 January 2014 that \u201cthe principles of the judgment of the Grand Chamber in this case appear on their face to apply to this case\u201d as well.\nThe reasoning of the majority in the present case is based on the premise that the Grand Chamber erred in its understanding of the domestic law as expressed in the case of Vinter and Others in 2013, and also on the fact that, since \u201cit is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation\u201d (see paragraph 24 of the judgment), they were prepared to accept that the correct interpretation of the domestic law was provided in the post-Vinter judgment delivered by the special composition of the Court of Appeal on 18 February 2014 in the case of R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim 188. In that judgment, the Court of Appeal disagreed with the Grand Chamber\u2019s views on the clarity and certainty of the domestic law as first set out in R v. Bieber [2009], and reaffirmed that this interpretation was sufficiently clear and certain. Assuming that this is so, I fail to see the bearing of this progressive development of the law on the applicant\u2019s situation a year earlier, in 2008, when his complaints were submitted to the Court, or at the time of their examination by the Court in 2015.\nUnlike in the unanimous judgment of the same Section in the case of Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria (nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014), the majority in the present case failed to express any view as to whether, how and at what point the interpretation of the domestic law established in Bieber [2009] and R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin [2014] changed, ceased to apply or made the applicant\u2019s situation more compatible with the principles laid down by the Grand Chamber in examining the situation of the applicants in Vinter.\nThe issue in the case of Mr Hutchinson is not whether the Court ( see paragraph 25) \u201cmust accept the national court\u2019s interpretation of the domestic law\u201d as clarified in the process of \u201cprogressive development of the law through [the] judicial interpretation\u201d (paragraph 24) provided by the Court of Appeal after Vinter as being the correct one, but whether or not in 2008 the applicant was in fact \u201centitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought\u201d as required by the principles established in Vinter (\u00a7 122).

THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application nos. 36529/97 and 37393/97)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n29 September 1999\nFINAL\n29/12/1999\nIn the case of Moore and Gordon v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J-P. Costa, President,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr L. Loucaides,\nMr P. K\u016bris,\nMr W. Fuhrmann,\nMrs H.S. Greve,\nMr K. Traja, Judges,\nand Mrs S. doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 September 1999,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The relevant provisions of the Air Force Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the Coyne case (the Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1848-52, \u00a7\u00a7 20-44).\n10. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n11. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n12. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n13. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court-martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command.\n14. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court-martial\u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.\n15. Since the applicants\u2019 trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, at p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57).\n16. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides for a penalty of up to six months\u2019 imprisonment, a fine or both for the offence of common assault. The maximum penalty for disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind is two years\u2019 imprisonment (section 66 of the 1955 Act).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. Each of the applicants complained, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that he did not have a fair or public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Article 6 \u00a7 1, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination \u2026 of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing \u2026 by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. \u2026\u201d\nA Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n18. The Court notes the potential penalty of six months\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Moore\u2019s case) and of two years\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Gordon\u2019s case), together with the nature of the charges of which the applicants were found guilty. It considers that the applicants\u2019 court-martial proceedings involved the determination of charges of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, the Garyfallou Aebe v. Greece judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1977-V, no. 49, p. 1830, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, with further references).\n#### B. Independence and impartiality of the applicants\u2019 courts-martial\n19. The applicants mainly argued that their courts-martial were not independent or impartial and that the proceedings against them were consequently unfair. The Government made no observations on the admissibility of the case except to note that it raised issues similar to those in respect of which the Court had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the above-cited Findlay case. Having reserved their position as to the merits, the Government did not submit any further observations.\n20. The Court recalls that, in the above-mentioned Findlay judgment, the Court held that a general court-martial convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955 did not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality set down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in view, in particular, of the central part played in its organisation by the convening officer. In this latter respect, the Court considered that the convening officer was central to the applicant's prosecution and was closely linked to the prosecution authorities; the Court expressed some concern that the members of the court-martial were subordinate (either directly or indirectly) to the convening officer; and the Court found it significant that the convening officer also acted as confirming officer.\n21. The Court subsequently found a district court-martial convened pursuant to the Air Force Act 1955 to have similar deficiencies (the above-cited Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment). In particular, it considered that there were no significant differences between the part played by the convening officer in Mr Coyne's court-martial, under the Air Force Act 1955, and in that of Mr Findlay, under the Army Act 1955. While an appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court was open to Mr Coyne, the Court concluded that the organisational defects in the court-martial could not be corrected by any subsequent review procedure because an accused faced with a serious criminal charge is entitled to a first instance tribunal which meets the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In addition, the Court subsequently found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the same basis in a series of cases involving complaints about the independence and impartiality of army and air force district and general courts-martial convened pursuant to the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 (the Cable and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 February 1999, unpublished).\n22. The Court recalls that in the present case district air force courts-martial were convened pursuant to the Air Force Act 1955 to try the applicants. It can find no reason to distinguish the present cases from those of Mr Findlay, Mr Coyne or Mr Cable and Others as regards the part played by the convening officer in the organisation of their courts-martial. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicants\u2019 courts-martial did not meet the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court also considers that, since the applicants were faced with, inter alia, charges of a serious and criminal nature and were therefore entitled to a first instance tribunal complying with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, such organisational defects in their courts-martial could not be corrected by any subsequent review procedure.\n23. Accordingly, and for the reasons expressed in detail in the above-cited judgment of the Court in Mr Findlay's case, the Court concludes that the courts-martial which dealt with the applicants\u2019 case were not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. The Court is further of the opinion that, since the applicants\u2019 courts-martial have been found to lack independence and impartiality, they could not guarantee either of the applicants a fair trial (the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, Comm. Report, at \u00a7 108).\n#### C. Remaining points at issue\n25. The applicants also complained that their courts-martial were not \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cestablished by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Mr Moore further complained that he had had no say in the choice of venue for his court-martial hearing.\n26. In view of its conclusions at paragraphs 23 and 24 above, the Court finds that, in the present case, it is unnecessary also to examine these complaints of the applicants.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n28. Following the decision of the Court declaring the applications admissible, the Court, by letter dated 15 March 1999, requested the applicants to submit by 3 May 1999 their claims for just satisfaction. Although the applicants had claimed just satisfaction, without further elaboration, in their original applications, no claims either for compensation or reimbursement of costs and expenses were submitted in response to the Court\u2019s letter of 15 March 1999.\nThe Court recalls that it is not required to examine such matters of its own motion and, consequently, finds that it is unnecessary to apply Article 41 in this case (the Huvig v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-B, p. 57, \u00a7 37-38).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1.

Holds that it is not required to apply Article 41 of the Convention in this case.\nDone in English, then sent as a certified copy on 29 September 1999, according to Article 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 et 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n35. The relevant domestic law concerning the enforcement of a parent\u2019s visiting rights is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case P.P. v. Poland no. 8677/03, \u00a7\u00a7 69-74, 8 January 2008.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter, M. He alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, which provides\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Government submitted a preliminary objection that the applicant had failed to exhaust the required domestic remedies. They stressed that the applicant had failed to appeal against the decisions of 5 October 1995, 27 November 1997 and 7 January 2005.\n39. The applicant replied that he had made use of all available remedies in respect of his complaints.\n40. The Court notes, that in the present case the applicant did not object to the contact arrangements as specified in the decisions of 5 October 1995, 27 November 1997 and 7 January 2005. He only maintained that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter.\n41. In this respect the Court observes that it is true that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions referred to by the Government. However, he appealed against other decisions given in his case (see paragraphs 21, 24). He further initiated enforcement proceedings and asked the domestic courts to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the access arrangements (see paragraphs 28 and 32).\n42. Against this background, the Court concludes that the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust the national channels of redress. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government\u2019s objections.\n43. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n44. The applicant claimed that there had been a continuing violation of his right to respect for family life. On many occasions he had asked to be allowed to see his daughter without the presence of his former wife and the court-appointed guardian, however to no avail. He had repeatedly instituted several sets of proceedings aimed at providing him with the opportunity to have regular contacts with M. He further claimed that the child\u2019s mother had a negative influence on M. As a result, emotional ties between them loosened and he became in fact excluded from the process of bringing up his child. He concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 in this respect.\n45. The Government stressed that the applicant was himself responsible for not achieving a deeper emotional contact with his daughter. Between October 1995 and October 1996 he had not participated in any meetings with his daughter. When the meetings finally took place he had insulted the child\u2019s mother.\n46. The Government pointed to the experts\u2019 opinion given in the domestic proceedings, according to which the applicant had a negative influence on his daughter. They stressed that the experts recommended limitation or suspension of the applicant\u2019s contacts with M. They submitted that despite the fact that the child had expressly stated that she did not wish to see her father, the public authorities maintained the applicant\u2019s right to continue to have contact with his child.\n47. They further stressed that when the mother had failed to comply with the court\u2019s decision of 9 March 2000 the Bedzin District Court had imposed a significant fine on her. Therefore, the steps taken by the courts to protect the applicant\u2019s rights were quick and efficient. The Government concluded that the authorities had done everything they could to protect the applicant\u2019s rights to respect his family life.\n48. They concluded that there was no violation of the applicant\u2019s right to family life.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n49. The relationship between the applicant and his daughter amounted to \u201cfamily life\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. This has not been disputed.\n50. The essential object of Article 8 is to protect an individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities. There are in addition positive obligations inherent in effective \u201crespect\u201d for family life. In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, Hokkanen v. Finland, judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 20, \u00a7 55).\n51. Where the measures in issue concern parental disputes over their children, however, it is not for the Court to substitute itself for the competent domestic authorities in regulating contact questions, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exercise of their power of appreciation. In so doing, it must determine whether the reasons purporting to justify any measures taken with regard to an applicant\u2019s enjoyment of his right to respect for family life are relevant and sufficient (see, amongst other authorities, Olsson v. Sweden, judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, p. 32, \u00a7 68).\n52. The obligation of the national authorities to take measures to facilitate contact by a non-custodial parent with children after divorce is not, however, absolute (see, mutatis mutandis, Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58). The key consideration is whether those authorities have taken all necessary steps to facilitate contact such as can reasonably be demanded in the special circumstances of each case (see, mutatis mutandis, Hokkanen, cited above, \u00a7 58).\n53. In examining whether non-enforcement of the access arrangements ordered by the domestic court amounted to a lack of respect for the applicant\u2019s family life the Court must strike a balance between the various interests involved, namely the interests of the applicant\u2019s daughter and her mother, those of the applicant himself and the general interest in ensuring respect for the rule of law.\n54. In the light of the above principles, what is decisive in this case is whether the Polish authorities took all the necessary adequate steps to facilitate the enforcement of the contact arrangements as specified on 5 October 1995 and 9 March 2000. According to the access orders the applicant was firstly authorised to meet M. every first Friday of the month for seven hours; subsequently he was authorised to meet M. three times a year for two hours.\n55. The difficulties in arranging contact were admittedly in large measure due to the animosity between the applicant\u2019s former wife and the applicant.\n56. The Court notes that between October 1995 and November 1996 the applicant failed to report at any meeting in the B\u0119dzin Family Centre. On the other hand, M. and W.K were present at every meeting (see paragraph 15). It is true that in 2000 and 2001 it was W.K. who had failed to bring her daughter to the family centre for several visits (see paragraph 25).\n57. The Court considers that the domestic authorities had an obligation to ensure enforcement of contact arrangements, since it is they who exercise public authority and have the means at their disposal to overcome problems in the way of execution. In this respect the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s enforcement request eventually led to the imposition of a fine (PLN 1,000) on W.K. on 20 October 2005.\n58. The Court observes that the conflict between the applicant and W.K. made it particularly difficult for the domestic authorities to act in order to enforce the applicant\u2019s visiting rights. Moreover, for some time the applicant himself failed to undertake effective steps in order to improve his contact with M. As time went by, M. matured and was able to take her own decisions in respect of her contacts with her father. The Court notes that the domestic authorities were also aware of the fact that the nature of the applicant\u2019s contact with M. became dependent not only on the attitude of her mother, but also on the child\u2019s own wishes (see paragraphs 27 and 34 above). In this respect the Court reiterates that it is not seeking to substitute itself for the domestic authorities in the exercise of their responsibilities as regards parental authority, but rather to review under the Convention the decisions taken by those authorities in the exercise of their power of appreciation (see Olsson, cited above, \u00a7 68)\n59. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1.

Holds that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 16 December 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President", "001-57849": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF DARNELL v.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 April and 24 September 1993,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\n20. Dr Darnell complained that the length of the proceedings relating to the termination of his employment by Trent RHA constituted a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, according to which:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\nThis allegation was supported by the Commission and is no longer contested by the Government.\n21. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be determined with reference to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law and in the light of the circumstances of the case, which in this instance call for an overall assessment.\nIn view of the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation, the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the dispute between the participants as to the starting date of the period to be taken into consideration in the present case. Even if the Court were to adopt the Government\u2019s position that, at the earliest, it should start to run from 10 August 1984, the date of the initial application to the Industrial Tribunal (see paragraph 15 above), the lapse of time of nearly nine years until the Employment Appeal Tribunal gave its reserved judgment on 8 April 1993 cannot, in the circumstances of the present case, be regarded as \u201creasonable\u201c.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)\n22. Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of this Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\n#### A. Non-pecuniary damage\n23. Dr Darnell sought \u00a35,000 by way of compensation for the considerable stress and strain which he has suffered over the years in which he has been fighting legal battles instead of practising medicine.\n24. The Court notes that Dr Darnell\u2019s medical competence was not challenged or criticised, but he none the less suffered serious damage to his professional career as a result of time lost from the practice of medicine.\nThe Court acknowledges the public apology which was given to Dr Darnell by the Government\u2019s representative at the hearing before it. It takes the view, however, that in all the circumstances further satisfaction is required and accordingly holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount claimed.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n25. For lawyer\u2019s fees and disbursements, Dr Darnell sought reimbursement of the sum of \u00a33,922.11 less the 6,025 French francs already paid by way of legal aid provided by the Council of Europe in respect of the proceedings before the Court. No claims were made for travel and subsistence expenses, which were covered by the above grant of legal aid.\n26. Having examined the claim, which the Government accepted was reasonable, in the light of the criteria emerging from its case-law, the Court finds that the applicant should be awarded the amount claimed in its entirety and that this figure should be increased by any value-added tax that may be chargeable.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1);\n2. Holds that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant, within three months:\n- \u00a35,000 (five thousand pounds) by way of compensation for non-pecuniary damage;\n- \u00a33,922.11 (three thousand nine hundred and twenty-two pounds and eleven pence) by way of legal costs and expenses less 6,025 (six thousand and twenty-five) French francs, together with any value-added tax that may be chargeable.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 October 1993.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 EISSEN\nRegistrar", "001-76746": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BARROW v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. National Insurance\n11. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory national insurance (\u201cNI\u201d) contributions into the National Insurance Fund (NIF). This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n12. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NI scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NI contributions fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paras. 25-26).\n13. Primary Class 1 contributions to NI cease to be payable on attainment of the State retirement age (section 6(3) of the SSCBA).\n14. The NIF is currently the sole source of funding for payment of state retirement pensions as well as a number of other benefits, including IB. Topping up into the fund by way of Treasury Grant is possible in times of shortfall but has not occurred since 1997/1998.\n##### 2. Invalidity Benefit (IB)\n15. The Social Security (Incapacity for work) Act 1994 amended the 1992 Act so as to include provision for the payment of IB from April 1995. Section 1 provides, as relevant:\n\u201c... (1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, a person who satisfies either of the following conditions is entitled to short-term incapacity benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of incapacity for work.\n(2) The conditions are that -\n(a) he is under pensionable age on the day in question and satisfies the contribution conditions specified for short-term incapacity benefit in Schedule 3, Part 1, paragraph 2;\n...\n(4) In any period of incapacity for work a person is not entitled to short-term incapacity benefit for more than 364 days.\n(5) Where a person ceases by virtue of subsection (4) above to be entitled to short-term incapacity benefit, he is entitled to long-term incapacity benefit in respect of any subsequent day of incapacity for work in the same period of incapacity for work on which he is not over pensionable age.\u201d\n16. IB is a contributory benefit funded out of NI contributions, designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or disability. It is therefore available throughout the assumed working life. As a result the period of entitlement is directly linked, for men and women, to the period of entitlement (if any) to receive the State retirement pension. When an individual reaches State pension age any entitlement to such a pension takes the place of IB. A full basic retirement pension pays GBP 77.45 per week, while the standard rate of IB is GBP 72.15.\n##### 3. State retirement pension\n17. At the relevant time, section 122 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 defined \u201cpensionable age\u201d as:\n\u201c(a) the age of 65, in the case of a man; and\n(b) the age of 60, in the case of a woman\u201d.\n18. Women in the United Kingdom therefore become eligible for a State pension at the age of 60, whereas men are not eligible until 65.\n19. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The State pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in the State pension age.\n#### C. European Union law\n20. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d.\n21. In its judgment in Case C-328/91 Thomas and Others [1993] ECR I-1247, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that where, pursuant to Article 7(1)(a), a Member State prescribed different pensionable ages for men and women for the purpose of granting old-age and retirement pensions the scope of the permitted derogation defined by the words \u201cpossible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under other benefits schemes which were necessarily and objectively linked to the difference in pensionable age. That was the position where such forms of discrimination were objectively necessary to avoid disturbing the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure coherence between the retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes.\n22. In Case C-92/94 Secretary of State for Social Security v. Graham [1999] ECR I-2521, the ECJ considered the predecessor of IB, namely invalidity allowance and invalidity pension (both contributory benefits paid from NI contributions until pensionable age or until the cessation of any deferment in pension). It found that the measures were justified by both considerations of financial equilibrium and overall coherence and that the discrimination was necessarily linked to the difference in pensionable age for men and women, inter alia as invalidity benefit was designed to replace income from occupational activity and was replaced by a retirement pension at the age at which the recipients would in any event stop working.\n23. The derogation was not however held to justify pension-aged linked discrimination in a number of benefits e.g. in R. v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Taylor [1999] ECR I-8955, the ECJ held that the provision of winter fuel allowances for the elderly was not necessarily linked to the difference in the statutory age of retirement for men and women and in R. v. Secretary of State for Health ex parte Richardson [1995] ECR I-3407, the ECJ found that the discrimination in age entitlement to free prescriptions was not objectively justified to ensure coherence between the retirement pension system and the regulations concerning prescriptions and was not necessarily linked to the difference between pensionable ages for men and women.\n24. In Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security , ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (\u201cthe EOC case\u201d concerning a reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court relating to the differing contribution periods applicable to men and women determined according to pensionable age), the ECJ found that:\n\u2022 Article 7(1)(a) had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference;\n\u2022 Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age;\n\u2022 In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the Member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)(a) were to be interpreted restrictively.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\n25. The applicant complained that she had lost her entitlement to IB at age 60 whereas a man could continue to draw the benefit until age 65. The relevant provisions of the Convention provide:\nArticle 14 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n26. The applicant submitted that it was grossly unfair that she was worse off than a man in her position of the same age. The difference in benefit received was of considerable importance to her. She pointed to the Government\u2019s own White Paper on the subject which referred to the difference in State pension ages as \u201cthe last glaring inequality in the Government\u2019s treatment of men and women\u201d and to measures introduced by the European Union requiring equality of treatment in benefits. The change in the law which would take effect in 2020 would be far too late to benefit her. She disputed that the system favoured women as a whole, pointing out that men were able to enjoy a number of other benefits over the age of 60 even if in full-time employment (e.g. winter fuel allowance, free prescriptions). Men who were in receipt of IB over the age of 60 also had their NI contributions paid in full allowing them to contribute towards a higher State pension.\n27. In so far as the level of her State pension was lower than IB due to her incomplete contributions record, the applicant pointed out that this was because she had had four children over seven years and had to look after them for a number of years. She had been unaware, as she was sure most women were, that her subsequent contributions on return to work would not allow for a full State pension.\n##### 2. The Government\n28. The Government accepted that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applied to the case and that Article 14 was applicable to any discrimination in relation to the availability of benefits such as the IB, funded from the NIF. They submitted that the differential age for men and women had, however, an objective and reasonable justification. They emphasised that the social, historic and economic basis for the provision of the State retirement pension, as well as the decision to equalise the age progressively from 2010-2020 involved complex social and economic judgments in respect of which the Government enjoyed a broad margin of appreciation. It was not a simple case of sex discrimination but involved issues of fair balance under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 where the Court had stated that it would respect the legislator\u2019s assessment in such matters unless it was devoid of reasonable foundation.\n29. The Government submitted that Parliament decided to implement the reform to equalise State pension ages from 2020 as the measure had enormous financial implications both for individuals and the State. In particular, sudden change would adversely affect the interests of women who had been expecting to receive a State pension at age 60 and a long transitional period gave time for people to adjust their expectations and arrange their affairs accordingly. Nor would it be economically feasible for the Government to provide all 60-year-old men with pensions pending equalisation in 2020 as it would involve the diversion of substantial resources from other State needs (an estimated cost of GBP 75 billion). After a full public consultation exercise, the Government decided to bring the age up to 65 for all based on the considerations that people lived longer and healthier lives, there would be more pensioners supported by fewer people of working age, public expenditure on pensions was set to double by 2035 and occupational schemes were predominantly equalising at the age of 65 already. They pointed out that the European Union had accepted that Member States must be allowed a period of transition to plan and implement the move to equal ages. The United Kingdom\u2019s plans were in line with other developed nations and the European Commission had never suggested that its measures were in any way deficient or disproportionate but had impliedly accepted them.\n30. The Government furthermore submitted that the linkage of the IB to pensionable age was objectively justified by the needs of financial equilibrium and systemic coherence. IB was a benefit funded out of NI contributions designed to protect the recipient against loss of income due to incapacity for the duration of their presumed working life. Systemic and fiscal coherence required that working life be taken as the working life upon which State pensionable age and NI contributions were based. Thus the linkage between the availability of IB and State pensionable age was necessary and justified, as accepted by the ECJ (see paragraph 21 above). It would not be possible to change the linkage by setting all IB entitlements as lasting to age 65 as this would produce incoherent results and impact adversely, inter alia, on those women with more complete pension contribution records than this applicant, who would find it more advantageous to receive their pension early. The linkage was also in the interests and fair treatment of other contributors to the NIF, particularly male contributors who were generally disadvantaged by the present scheme. They also pointed out that the discrimination complained of in this case had a very narrow compass, affecting only some women between age 60 and 65. The lower State pension age and NI contribution record in the great majority of cases worked to the advantage of women and the move from IB to a pension was advantageous to women with a full or nearly full contribution record. The difference in this applicant\u2019s position was a direct reflection of her contributions record. The fact that men over 60 in receipt of IB had their NI contributions paid for a further five years did not result in any unfair advantage as male entitlement to a full State pension was set five years\u2019 higher than that applicable to women. A man with the applicant\u2019s contribution record would only receive a partial pension also, though at the rate of 66% instead of 62%.\n31. The Government referred to the recent judgment in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006, submitting that this had addressed and disposed of the material issues in the case, in particular that a linkage between benefits and the old-age pension scheme was necessary to preserve coherence, that there was a very generous margin of appreciation and that the decisions as to the precise timing and means of putting right the inequality were not so manifestly unreasonable as to exceed this margin.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n32. Article 14 of the Convention has no independent existence; it has effect solely in relation to \u201cthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u201d safeguarded by those provisions. There can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them (see, amongst other authorities, Gaygusuz v. Austria, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1996-IV, \u00a7 36). The Court notes that the Government do not contest in this case that the applicant\u2019s entitlement to IB falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and thus that Article 14 is applicable to any complaint of discrimination in that respect. Article 14 is accordingly engaged.\n33. The principal issue in this case is whether the difference in treatment whereby this applicant lost her entitlement to IB at age of 60, whereas a man of that age would not, discloses discrimination based on sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention.\n34. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, a difference in treatment is discriminatory for the purposes of Article 14 if it \u201chas no objective and reasonable justification\u201d, that is if it does not pursue a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether or not and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. However, very weighty reasons are required before the Court would regard a difference of treatment based exclusively on the grounds of sex as compatible with the Convention (see, among other authorities, Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, ECHR 2002-IV, \u00a7 39).\n35. Against this must be balanced the countervailing proposition that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one (see, inter alia, James v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A, no. 98, \u00a7 46). This applies to systems of taxation or contributions which must inevitably differentiate between groups of tax-payers and the implementation of which unavoidably creates marginal situations. A Government may often have to strike a balance between the need to raise revenue and reflecting other social objectives in taxation policies. The national authorities are obviously in a better position than the Court to assess those needs and requirements, which in the present case involve complex concerns about the financing of pensions and benefits which impact on the community as a whole. In such an area the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is manifestly unreasonable (see, as the latest authority, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 52).\n36. The Court recalls that in the afore-mentioned Stec case the Grand Chamber had occasion to examine the alleged inequality arising out of entitlement to the reduced earnings allowance (\u201cREA\u201c) which was linked to the State pension. As in this case, the applicant, Mrs Stec, lost her entitlement to the benefit at the age of 60 while a man would have continued to receive it until the age of 65. Both the REA and IB were benefits designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or incapacity and thus connected to employment and working life. The use of the State pension age as a cut off point made, the Government argued, the scheme easy to understand and to administer and the Court accepted that such questions of administrative economy and coherence were generally matters falling within the margin of appreciation referred to above (Stec, \u00a7 57). Also of strong persuasive value is the ECJ\u2019s stance on the objective necessity of ensuring consistency with the pension scheme in the entitlement to such employment-linked benefits (see Stec, cited above, \u00a7 58, and Relevant domestic law and practice, paragraphs 21-22). As in the Stec case therefore, the linkage of the cut-off age of IB to the notional end of working life or State pensionable age must be regarded as pursuing a legitimate aim and as being reasonably and objectively justified (see \u00a7 59).\n37. As regards the actual difference in State pension age between men and women, the Grand Chamber in Stec had this to say.\n\u201c61. Differential pensionable ages were first introduced for men and women in the United Kingdom in 1940, well before the Convention had come into existence, although the disparity persists to the present day (see paragraph 32 above). It would appear that the difference in treatment was adopted in order to mitigate financial inequality and hardship arising out of the woman\u2019s traditional unpaid role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. At their origin, therefore, the differential pensionable ages were intended to correct \u2018factual inequalities\u2019 between men and women and appear therefore to have been objectively justified under Article 14 (see paragraph 51 above).\n62. It follows that the difference in pensionable ages continued to be justified until such time that social conditions had changed so that women were no longer substantially prejudiced because of a shorter working life. This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the Government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986, it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 33 above).\n63. According to the information before the Court, the Government made a first, concrete, move towards establishing the same pensionable age for both sexes with the publication of the Green Paper in December 1991. It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 52 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 37 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 38 above).\n64. In the light of the original justification for the measure as correcting financial inequality between the sexes, the slowly evolving nature of the change in women\u2019s working lives, and in the absence of a common standard amongst the Contracting States (see Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-43), the Court finds that the United Kingdom cannot be criticised for not having started earlier on the road towards a single pensionable age.\n65. Having once begun the move towards equality, moreover, the Court does not consider it unreasonable of the Government to carry out a thorough process of consultation and review, nor can Parliament be condemned for deciding in 1995 to introduce the reform slowly and in stages. Given the extremely far-reaching and serious implications, for women and for the economy in general, these are matters which clearly fall within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation.\u201d\n38. The alleged discrimination in the present case flows from exactly the difference in ages of entitlement to the State pension discussed above. In light of the Grand Chamber\u2019s finding that the policy adopted by the legislature in deferring equalisation of the pension age for men and women until 2020 fell within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, the Court cannot but reach the same conclusion in the present case.\n39. There has, accordingly, been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 22 August 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L. Early Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President", "001-67071": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF PEDERSEN AND PEDERSEN v. DENMARK\n(Application no. 68693/01)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n14 October 2004\nFINAL\n14/01/2005\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Pedersen and Pedersen v. Denmark,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (First Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr C.L. Rozakis, President,\nMr P. Lorenzen,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMrs N. Vaji\u0107,\nMrs E. Steiner,\nMr K. Hajiyev, judges,\nand Mr S. Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n34. The applicants complained that the proceedings in their cases had exceeded a reasonable time, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ...any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal...\u201d\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n35. The Government maintained that based on an overall assessment and in the light of the specific circumstances of the cases, the criminal charges against the applicants were determined within a reasonable time as prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention. They agreed that the cases were uncomplicated as concerned the facts, but found that they were to some extent complex due to problems in law as well as procure. In this respect the Government referred inter alia to the involvement of EU-law issues, notably the question whether the relevant provision of the 1989 Act should have been notified to the European Commission and the question whether the cases should have been referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Moreover, the Government found that the applicants to a very considerable extent had been a contributory cause to the length of the proceedings. Finally, the Government maintained that it could not give rise to criticism that the city courts decided to adjourn the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the \u201ctest-cases\u201d as these decisions were reasonably motivated. All in all the Government found it inappropriate that the applicants on the one hand requested adjournments of the proceedings; extensions of time-limits for submission of pleadings; were unable to appear before court hearings before certain dates; raised questions of principles, including a request for a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice; requested an expert witness; and a special counsel assigned, and on the other hand claimed that the length of the proceedings were excessive.\n36. The applicants contested that the proceedings were complex. On the contrary, it was very simple cases and the only unusual initiative was the request to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The latter, however, had been of crucial relevance and the applicants could not be blamed for making use of remedies available under Danish law. Furthermore, the applicants found that there were several periods of unacceptable inactivity during the proceedings for which only the Government were to blame, including the delay caused by the applicants\u2019 claim that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority. In any event the applicants found that the duration of the proceedings before the Supreme Court had been excessive. Two other factors had caused an unreasonable delay of the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 opinion; the adjournment of their cases pending the outcome of corresponding cases and the lack of resources in the Danish court system. Finally, the applicants pointed out that they had not in any way been compensated for the lengthy proceedings e.g. by having been imposed a more mitigating sentence.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n37. As regards the alleged breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it is undisputed that the proceedings as to the first applicant commenced on 20 October 1992, and as to the second applicant on 26 October 1993. The proceedings ended on 16 February 2001 when the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. Thus, the total length of the proceedings, which the Court must assess under Article 6 \u00a7 1, was eight years, three months and twenty\u2011seven days; and seven years, three months and twenty-two days; respectively.\n38. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case\u2011law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the authorities before which the case was brought (cf. P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC] no.25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n(a) Complexity of the case\n39. The Court notes that it was not in dispute that the proceedings were uncomplicated as concerned the facts. Reiterating that the first applicant before the High Court requested that an expert witness be heard; that both applicants before the Supreme Court requested that an additional counsel be assigned to plead on the EU-law issues of the case; and that the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submit written replies to various questions put by counsel as regards EU issues, the Court considers that certain features as to law and procedure were to some extent complex and time\u2011consuming.\n(b) Conduct of the applicants\n40. The Court reiterates that only delays attributable to the State may justify a finding of failure to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (e.g. Humen v. Poland, no. 26614/95, \u00a7 66, 15 October 1999). It notes that the applicants do not appear to have been very much involved in the procedural disputes during the proceedings concerned. However, it follows from the case-law that they are nevertheless to be held responsible for the possible delays caused by their representatives (see amongst others Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, \u00a7 28; A. and Others v. Denmark, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, \u00a7 74); and mutatis mutandis Stanford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 282-A, \u00a7 28).\n41. The Court observes that the first applicant, being represented by counsel, agreed to an adjournment of his trial before the City Court from December 1993 until September 1995, in order to await the outcome of a pending corresponding case, in which a defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority as it contravened articles of the Penal Code and provisions of the Environmental Protection Act. The first applicant agreed to a second adjournment of his trial from December 1995 until the autumn of 1996, in order to await the outcome of another pending corresponding case, in which the defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC. Accordingly, the first applicant did not at any time during the proceedings before the City Court object to the fact that his trial was adjourned with almost three years in order to await the outcome of so-called \u201ctest-cases\u201d.\n42. As regards the second applicant, the Court reiterates that, being represented by counsel, he agreed to an adjournment of his trial before the City Court with approximately one year from September 1994 until October 1995 in order to await the outcome of a pending corresponding test\u2011case. Thereafter, his trial was adjourned on counsel\u2019s request with five months from November 1995 until April 1996, and with two months from October until December 1996. Finally, at a hearing held in February 1997 counsel stated that he was unable to appear until September 1997, accordingly seven months later. Before the High Court, counsel for the second applicant stated that he was unable to appear on the proposed dates in January, February and May 1998, and the case was accordingly scheduled for trial on 27 August 1998.\n43. Before the Supreme Court, in the beginning of 1999 the applicants requested that the case be referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling; that an additional counsel be assigned; or in the alternative that a substitute counsel could plead on the EU-issues. The latter being granted, the proceeding were adjourned until October 1999, when the substitute counsel was able to submit his first written pleading. Subsequently, the exchange of pleadings on EU-issues continued until April 2000 because the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submitted written replies to various questions put by the substitute counsel.\n44. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that the first applicant and his counsel were responsible or co-responsible for prolonging the proceedings with at least four years and three months, and that the second applicant and his counsel were responsible or co-responsible for prolonging the proceedings with at least four years and four months. Therefore the applicants were to a considerable extent responsible for the protracted nature of the proceedings.\n(c) Conduct of the national authorities\n45. The Court notes that the investigation period in the proceedings against the first and the second applicant lasted respectively eleven months and four months. In the Court\u2019s view the length of those periods cannot be criticised.\n46. The trial against the first applicant before the City Court lasted from 13 September 1993, when the indictment was submitted, until 28 May 1997, when the judgment was pronounced, thus almost three years and nine months, which do appear excessive for such a case. Of this period, almost three years passed in order to await the outcome of two test-cases on the 1989 Act, which were pending before other judicial instances. In the Court\u2019s view, when assessing the relevance and reasonableness of an adjournment of a criminal trial pending the outcome of another case, be it a test-case or not, it must be taken into account what is at stake for the persons involved (see inter alia Boddaert v. Belgium, judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 235\u2011D, \u00a7 38). Also, since adjournment of criminal proceedings in general have a serious impact to the detriment of the indicted, the progress of the case which outcome is awaited, should be monitored thoroughly by the court which decides to adjourn the criminal trial. Finally, as to test-cases which are considered to be of significant importance to pending criminal proceedings, the Court finds it incumbent on the responsible authorities to proceed with such as diligently as possible.\n47. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court reiterates that the test-cases concerned the legal authority of the 1989 Act pursuant to which the first applicant had been charged. Thus, had the outcome of any of the test\u2011cases turned out in favour of the relevant indicted freshwater fish farmer, it would most likely have had significant influence on the charges against the first applicant, and maybe to the extent that he should have been acquitted. Also, the Court reiterates that no coercive measures were imposed on the first applicant while his trial was adjourned. In addition, the Court notes that the parties and the City Court agreed to the extended prolongation. In these specific circumstances, the Court is satisfied that the adjournment was relevant and reasonable.\n48. The trial against the second applicant before the City Court was terminated by a judgment of 16 September 1997, thus three years and six months after its commencement. Of this period thirteen months passed in order to await the outcome of a pending test-case on the 1989 Act. Referring to its finding above, the Court is satisfied that this adjournment was relevant and reasonable. Moreover, on counsel\u2019s request, the trial was adjourned with five months from November 1995 until April 1996, and with two months from October until December 1996. Also, at a hearing held in February 1997 counsel stated that he was unable to appear until September 1997, thus seven months later. In these circumstances the Court finds that the proceedings before the City Court as to the second applicant did not disclose any periods of unacceptable inactivity for which the national authorities can be blamed.\n49. The proceedings before the High Court as regards respectively the first and the second applicant lasted from 9 June 1997 until 29 June 1998; and from 23 September 1997 until 3 September 1998. In the Court\u2019s view the length of those proceedings cannot be criticised. It observes in addition that the latter case was ready to be listed for trial on 27 November 1997, but that the applicant\u2019s counsel was unable to appear on the proposed dates in January, February and May 1998.\n50. The proceedings before the Leave to Appeal Board as regards respectively the first and the second applicant lasted from 7 July 1998 until 23 November 1998; and from 11 September 1998 until 23 November 1998, which cannot be criticised.\n51. On 15 January 1999, the applicants\u2019 joined cases were brought before the Supreme Court, which pronounced judgment on 16 February 2001. Accordingly, those proceedings lasted two years and one month. Of this period approximately one year and seven months was spent on EU-law issues until on 22 August 2000 the Supreme Court refused the applicants\u2019 request to refer the case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, as the Supreme Court found that there was no obligation to notify the European Commission of the specific section of the Act on freshwater fish farms of 5 April 1989 and there was no reasonable doubt that the section in question was in accordance with European Community legislation. Reiterating, that the applicants\u2019 substitute counsel was unable to submit his first written pleading until October 1999, and that subsequently the exchange of pleadings on the EU-issues continued until April 2000 because the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submitted written replies to various questions, the Court finds that the period spend on EU-issues cannot be considered unreasonable. The remainder of proceedings before the Supreme Court, namely from 22 August 2000 until 16 February 2001 did not, in the Court\u2019s view disclose any periods of unacceptable inactivity.\n(d) Conclusion\n52. Therefore, making an overall assessment of the complexity of the case, the conduct of all concerned as well as the total length of the proceedings before three court instances, these proceedings did not, in the Court\u2019s view, go beyond what may be considered reasonable in this particular case. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in respect of the length of the proceedings.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 14 October 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS\u00f8ren Nielsen Christos Rozakis\nRegistrar President", "001-78427": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BURDEN and BURDEN v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 September and 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance tax\n12. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person's property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 275,000 for transfers between 5 April 2005 and 5 April 2006; GBP 285,000 for transfers during the tax year 2006-2007; and GBP 300,000 for 2007-2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n13. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the tax-payer's election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (1984 Act, section 227(1)-(4)).\n14. Section 18(1) of the 1984 Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005, this exemption was extended to a deceased's \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d)\n15. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n16. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n17. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The 2004 Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering inter alia pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n18. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was passed in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had co-habited for at least 12 years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n19. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour Peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Caithlin [the Conservative Peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times\u2014at Second Reading and in Grand Committee\u2014and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, Liberal Democrat Peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith MP, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill\u2014granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law, with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings.\nWe heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that the Civil Partnership Bill is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives, not because those concerns are not important, but because the Bill is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them.\u201d\n#### C. The Human Rights Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1998 Act\u201d)\n20. The 1998 Act entered into force on 2 October 2000. Section 3(1) provides:\n\u201cSo far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\u201d\nSection 4 of the 1998 Act provides (so far as relevant):\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. ...\n(6) A declaration under this section ... -\n(a) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given; and\n(b) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.\u201d\nSection 6 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if -\n(a) as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted any differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of ... primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions. ...\u201d\nSection 10 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) This section applies if \u2013\n(a) a provision of legislation has been declared under section 4 to be incompatible with a Convention right and, if an appeal lies \u2013\n(i) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so; or\n(ii) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time; or\n(iii) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned; or\n(b) it appears to a Minister of the Crown or Her Majesty in Council that, having regard to a finding of the European Court of Human Rights made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against the United Kingdom, a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of the United Kingdom arising from the Convention.\n(2) If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility.\u201d\n21. The Government submitted that the objective of giving the national courts the power under section 4 had been to provide a formal means for notifying the Government and Parliament about a situation in which legislation was found not to comply with the Convention, and to provide a mechanism for speedily correcting the defect. Once a declaration had been made (or once the European Court of Human Rights had found a violation based on a provision of domestic law), there were two alternative avenues for putting right the problem: either primary legislation could be introduced in Parliament, or the Minister concerned could exercise his summary power of amendment under section 10 of the 1998 Act.\n22. When the Human Rights Bill passed through the House of Lords on 27 November 1997, the Lord Chancellor explained that:\n\u201cwe expect that the government and Parliament will in all cases almost certainly be prompted to change the law following a declaration of incompatibility.\u201d\nOne of the Ministers with responsibility for the 1998 Act explained to the House of Commons on 21 October 1998 that:\n\u201cOur proposals [for remedial orders] safeguard parliamentary procedures and sovereignty, ensure proper supervision of our laws and ensure that we can begin to get the ability both to enforce human rights law and to create a human rights culture. They also ensure that we can do it in the context of not having to worry that if something is decided by the Strasbourg court or by our courts that creates an incompatibility, we do not have a mechanism to deal with it in the quick and efficient way that may be necessary.\u201d\nThe most recent report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, published on 4 August 2006, showed that declarations of incompatibility had been made in twenty cases between December 2000 and December 2004. In seven of these cases the declaration had been overturned on appeal, or the judgment on appeal was pending. In ten cases the offending legislation had been amended or repealed (in one case by a remedial order), and in the remaining three cases, amendments to the offending legislation were pending or under consideration.\nTHE LAW\n23. The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, that when one of them died, the survivor would face a significant liability to inheritance tax, which would not be faced by the survivor of a marriage or a civil partnership. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION\n24. The Government contested the admissibility of the application on a number of grounds under Articles 34 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Article 34 provides:\n\u201cThe Court may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. ... \u201d\nArticle 35 \u00a7 1 states:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.\u201d\n#### A. The applicants' victim status\n25. The Government submitted that the complaint was prospective and hypothetical, because no liability to inheritance tax had yet accrued, and might never accrue. The present applicants could not, therefore, claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d of any violation, and their complaint represented a challenge to the tax regime in abstracto, which the Court could not entertain.\nThe present case was on that ground distinguishable from Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, where the applicants had been complaining about certain provisions of Belgian law that applied automatically to the illegitimate child and her mother, and Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, where the complaint concerned rights of inheritance where the parent had already died. In contrast, the requirement to pay inheritance tax did not apply automatically. The applicants were not so affected by the risk of a future liability to tax as to bring them into a comparable position to the applicants in Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1982, Series A no. 48, where the Court found that a threat of inhuman and degrading punishment could in itself breach Article 3 of the Convention, or Norris v. Ireland, judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, where the existence of criminal sanctions for homosexual acts must necessarily have affected the applicant's daily conduct and private life.\n26. The applicants responded that it was all but inevitable that one of them would predecease the other, and similarly certain that the value of the deceased's estate would exceed the nil rate threshold for inheritance tax (see paragraph 13 above). Thus, as in Marckx (cited above), or Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, both of which concerned complaints about the effect of illegitimacy on succession rights under domestic law, the applicants ran a very high risk of a violation of their Convention rights. Even before either had died, the legislation had an impact on them, as it affected their choices about disposing of their property. They had \u201can awful fear\u201d hanging over them that the house would have to be sold to pay the tax, and they should not have to wait until one of them died before being able to seek the protection of the Convention.\n27. The Court recalls that under Article 34 of the Convention it may receive applications from individuals and others \u201cclaiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto\u201d. In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure (see, for example, Cornwell v. the United Kingdom, no. 36578/97, decision of 11 May 1999).\n28. It is true that neither of the applicants is, at the present time, under an obligation to pay inheritance tax, since no such liability can arise until one of them dies. However, the sisters are aged 88 and 81 respectively. The property owned by each far exceeds the current nil-rate band for inheritance tax. The Court agrees with the applicants that, from the present perspective, it appears virtually certain that one of them will in the not too distant future be required to pay substantial inheritance tax on the property inherited from her sister. In this respect the present case is closer to Marckx than to, for example, Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-IV, where the Court found the applicant's complaint about discrimination concerning the future non-payment to him of a Widow's Pension or equivalent to be \u201chypothetical\u201d, because of the lack of certainty that the applicant would satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlement by the time he reached the age at which a woman in his position would be eligible to apply.\n29. The Court concludes, therefore, in the light of the applicants' advanced age and the very high probability that one will be liable to pay inheritance tax upon the death of the other, that they can claim to be directly affected by the impugned law. It follows that the Court rejects the first of the Government's objections to the admissibility of the application.\n#### B. Domestic remedies\n30. The Government further contended in the alternative that, if the applicants had an arguable complaint under the Convention, they could and should have brought a claim for a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act (see paragraph 21 above).\n31. The applicants were both currently alive and neither had yet incurred any liability to inheritance tax. Since no pecuniary loss had been suffered, the Court could not make a pecuniary award in their favour, and would, at most, make a declaration that there had been a violation of the applicants' Convention rights. If a declaration by this Court would constitute just satisfaction for any breach of the applicants' rights, a declaration of incompatibility by the High Court should similarly be regarded as an effective remedy.\n32. The Government argued that, consistently with the Court's approach and with the generally accepted principles of international law, they did not have to demonstrate either (i) that an application for a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act would necessarily have succeeded, or (ii) that provisions on inheritance tax in the 1984 Act would necessarily have been amended in any identified manner within any specific time period, even if a declaration of incompatibility were made. It was sufficient, for Article 35 \u00a7 1 to be engaged, that there was an available domestic remedy with a realistic prospect of success which the applicants had failed to pursue.\n33. They noted that in Hobbs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63684/00, 18 June 2002, the Court had found that, in the circumstances of that case, a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act was not sufficiently certain to be capable of providing redress, such as to require exhaustion by the applicant, on the grounds that: (i) a declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the litigation; (ii) the Minister has a power, but not a duty, to amend the relevant legislation; and (iii) the Minister could exercise his power to change the law only if there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for so doing. Hobbs, however, was a decision on its particular facts and could not be regarded as authority for any general proposition that a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act would never be capable of providing an effective remedy. In particular, the applicant in Hobbs had already suffered a financial disadvantage for which he was seeking monetary compensation. The present application was different because neither applicant had yet suffered any financial disadvantage. Moreover, the decision in Hobbs had inevitably been based on the extremely limited evidence and submissions then before the Court. Since the Court had now been provided with more information about the domestic law, in particular the ministerial statements set out in paragraph 23 above, it was both possible and appropriate for it to revisit its previous decision.\n34. The applicants referred to the Commission's case-law to the effect that the remedies an applicant is required to make use of must not only be effective but also independent of discretionary action by the authorities (for example, Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14 May 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 52, p. 227 and G. v. Belgium, no. 12604/86, Commission decision of 10 July 1991, DR 70, p. 125). They argued that a declaration of incompatibility could not be regarded as an effective remedy because the procedures to change the law could not be initiated by those who had obtained a declaration or enforced by any court or organ of State. The Court had accepted a similar argument in Hobbs and also in Dodds v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 59314/00, 8 April 2003, Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 37212/02, 16 March 2004, Pearson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 8374/03, 27 April 2004 and, finally, B. and L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36536/02, 29 June 2004, where the Government had made submissions almost identical to those in the present case.\n35. The Court is very much aware of the subsidiary nature of its role and that the object and purpose underlying the Convention, as set out in Article 1\u2014that rights and freedoms should be secured by the Contracting State within its jurisdiction\u2014would be undermined, along with its own capacity to function, if applicants were not encouraged to pursue the means at their disposal within the State to obtain available redress (see the B. and L. decision, cited above). The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention thus obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, no. 21893/93, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, Reports 1996-IV; Aksoy v. Turkey, no. 21987/93, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI).\n36. The Government argue that the remedy under the Human Rights Act allowing an applicant to seek a declaration from a domestic court that legislation is incompatible with the Convention is sufficiently certain and effective for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1. Such a declaration creates a discretionary power in the relevant government minister to take steps to amend the offending provision, either by a remedial order or by introducing a Bill in Parliament.\n37. The Court found in its Hobbs decision (cited above) that this remedy was not sufficiently effective, essentially for two reasons: first, because a declaration was not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it was made; and, secondly, because a declaration provided the appropriate minister with a power, not a duty, to amend the offending legislation by order so as to make it compatible with the Convention. Moreover, the minister concerned could exercise that power only if he considered that there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for doing so.\n38. The Court considers that the instant case is distinguishable from Hobbs, where the applicant had already suffered financial loss as a result of the discrimination about which he complained but could not have obtained monetary compensation through the grant of a declaration of incompatibility. It is closer to B. and L., where there had been no financial loss, although those applicants had already been prevented by the impugned legislation from marrying each other. In the present case, as in B. and L., it is arguable that, had a declaration of incompatibility been sought and made, the applicants might have been able to benefit from a future change in the law.\n39. However, it remains the case that there is no legal obligation on the minister to amend a legislative provision which has been found by a court to be incompatible with the Convention. The Court notes that, according to the information provided by the Government, by August 2006 such amendments had occurred in ten out of the thirteen cases where a declaration had been finally issued by the courts, and in the remaining three, reforms were pending or under consideration (see paragraph 23 above). It is possible that at some future date evidence of a long-standing and established practice of ministers giving effect to the courts' declarations of incompatibility might be sufficient to persuade the Court of the effectiveness of the procedure. At the present time, however, there is insufficient material on which to base such a finding.\n40. The Court does not consider that these applicants could have been expected to have exhausted, before bringing their application to Strasbourg, a remedy which is dependent on the discretion of the executive and which the Court has previously found to be ineffective on that ground.\nIt therefore rejects the Government's second objection to admissibility.\n#### C. Delay\n41. In the alternative, the Government submitted that the application was inadmissible under the six-months rule. The discrimination of which the applicants complained arose when an exemption for spouses was first introduced by the Finance Act 1975, and it first impacted on the applicants when they began co-habiting.\n42. The applicants contended that the violation about which they complained, arising out of legislative measures, was continuing, so that the six-months time-limit did not apply (see Norris, cited above). Further and in the alternative, the discrimination has intensified since the coming into force of the 2004 Act on 5 December 2005.\n43. The Court repeats that it has found the applicants to be directly affected by a provision of domestic law, given the high probability that it will automatically apply to the survivor following the first sister's death. In these circumstances and since there is no domestic remedy which the applicants can be required to exhaust, the six-months time-limit does not apply.\n#### D. The Court's conclusion on admissibility\n44. The Court considers that the application as a whole raises questions of law which are sufficiently serious that their determination should depend on an examination of the merits. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. The application must therefore be declared admissible. Pursuant to Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Court will now consider the merits of the applicants' complaint.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n#### A. The parties' submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n45. The Government emphasised that there was no right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to acquire possessions; in the Court's case-law on domestic inheritance laws, it had consistently held that, before the relevant death occurred, the presumptive heir had no property rights and that his or her hope of inheriting in the event of death could not therefore amount to a \u201cpossession\u201d (see Marckx, \u00a7 50; and also Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, \u00a7 38; Mazurek v. France, no. 34406/96, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43, ECHR 2000-II). Since each applicant was still alive and her complaint, as surviving sister, concerned the potential future impact of domestic law on their power to inherit, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not apply, and nor therefore did Article 14. The complaint made by each sister as the prospective first-to-die was also outside the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, because there was no restriction under domestic law on the applicants' ability to dispose of their property, only a potential liability to tax arising after death, when the deceased would no longer be in a position to enjoy her former possessions.\n46. In the alternative, if the Court were to find that the complaint fell within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Government denied that domestic law gave rise to any discrimination contrary to Article 14.\nFirst, the applicants could not claim to be in an analogous situation to a couple created by marriage or civil partnership (\u201ca couple\u201d). The very essence of their relationship was different, because a couple chose to become connected, whereas for sisters it was an accident of birth. In choosing to become a couple by entering into a formal relationship recognised by law, the partners also made a financial commitment to each other, and agreed to give the courts powers to divide their property and to order one partner to provide for the other on separation. The special legal status of parties to a marriage had been recognised by the Commission in Lindsay v. the United Kingdom, no. 11098/84, Commission decision of 11 November 1986, Decisions and Reports 49, p. 181 and by the Court in Shackell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45851/99, 27 April 2000. No such financial commitment arose by virtue of the relationship between siblings.\n47. The Government accepted that, if the applicants could be described as in an analogous position to a couple, there was a difference in treatment as regards exemption from inheritance tax. However, this difference in treatment did not exceed the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State, both in the field of taxation and when it came to financial measures designed to promote marriage (see Lindsay and Shackell).\nThe policy underlying the inheritance tax concession given to married couples was to provide the survivor with a measure of financial security, and thus promote marriage. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and the inheritance tax concession for civil partners served the same legitimate aim as it did in relation to married couples. Given the development of society's attitudes, the same arguments justified the promotion of stable, committed same-sex relationships. That objective would not be served by extending similar benefits to unmarried members of an existing family, such as siblings, whose relationship was already established by their consanguinity, and recognised by law. The difference in treatment thus pursued a legitimate aim.\n48. The difference in treatment was, moreover, proportionate, given that the applicants, as siblings, had not undertaken any of the burdens and obligations created by a legally recognised marriage or civil partnership. If the Government were to consider extending the inheritance tax concession to siblings, there would be no obvious reason not to extend it also to other co-habiting family members. Such a change would have considerable financial implications, given that the annual income from inheritance tax was approximately GBP 2.8 billion.\n##### 2. The applicants\n49. The applicants argued that if, as they had previously argued, they could claim to be victims of discrimination, the fact that neither had yet died could not provide a separate and substantive defence. Unlike the applicants in Marckx, the present applicants were not complaining about a provision of the English law of inheritance and, the principle that the Convention does not guarantee the right to acquire possessions on intestacy or through voluntary disposition was irrelevant. In circumstances where it was effectively inevitable that there would be significant tax to pay by the surviving sister, the facts fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and Article 14 was thus also applicable.\n50. The applicants could properly be regarded as being in a similar situation to a married or same-sex Civil Partnership Act couple. While it was true, as the Government had asserted, that many siblings were connected by nothing more than their common parentage, this was far from the case with the present applicants, who had chosen to live together in a loving, committed and stable relationship for several decades, sharing their only home, to the exclusion of other partners. Their actions in so doing were just as much an expression of their respective self-determination and personal development as would have been the case had they been joined by marriage or a civil partnership. The powers of the domestic courts to make property orders upon the breakdown of a marriage or civil partnership did not entail that the applicants were not in an analogous situation to such couples as regards inheritance tax. Moreover, the very reason that the applicants were not subject by law to the same corpus of legal rights and obligations as other couples was that they were prevented, on grounds of consanguinity, from entering into a civil partnership. The one significant difference between the applicants and a married couple was that the applicants, being sisters, would not lawfully be entitled to have a sexual relationship. This difference was not, however, relied upon by the Government, nor could it be, given that there was no requirement in the 2004 Act for those wishing to enter into a civil partnership to be in a sexual relationship with each other.\n51. Given that, as the Government asserted, the purpose of the inheritance tax exemption for married and civil partnership couples was the promotion of stable and committed relationships, the denial of an exemption to co-habiting adult siblings served no legitimate aim. The mere fact of being sisters did not entail a stable, committed relationship, and only a small minority of adult siblings were likely to share the type of relationship enjoyed by the applicants, involving prolonged mutual support, commitment and co-habitation.\n52. The applicants agreed with the Government that there was no obvious reason why, if the exception were granted to siblings, it should not also be extended to other family members who co-habit, but argued that this did not support a conclusion that the difference in treatment bore any relationship of proportionality to any legitimate aim. Such an exemption would, in fact, serve the policy interest invoked by the Government, namely the promotion of stable, committed family relationships among adults. Whilst the applicants accepted that the Court had no jurisdiction to dictate to the Government how best to remedy the discrimination, the amendments to the Civil Partnership Bill passed by the House of Lords (see paragraph 19 above) showed that it would be possible to construct a statutory scheme whereby two siblings or other close relations who had co-habited for a fixed number of years and chosen not to enter into a marriage or civil partnership could obtain certain fiscal rights or advantages. The Government's reliance on the margin of appreciation was misplaced in the light of the recognition given to the injustice faced by those in the applicants' position when the 2004 Act was passing through Parliament (ibid.). The applicants pointed out that the Government had been unable to provide an estimate of the loss of revenue which would flow from an inheritance tax exemption along the lines proposed in the House of Lords. They could not estimate the cost either, but pointed out that the lost revenue would have to be offset by the potential gains, for example, those flowing from an increased tendency, encouraged by the exemption, of close relations to care for disabled or elderly relatives, thus avoiding the need for State-funded care.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n53. The applicants do not complain, as in Marckx, that they will be prevented from acquiring property; they complain instead that the survivor will be required to pay tax on property they jointly own; an outcome which the Court has held to be highly probable (see paragraph 30 above). Since the duty to pay tax on existing property falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Article 14 is applicable.\n54. It is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment, in the field of taxation, of the aims to be followed and the means to be used (Lindsay, cited above). The State enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in this field, as is usual when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy (see, for example, James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, \u00a7 46; National and Provincial Building Society and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports 1997-VII, \u00a7 80). A government may often have to strike a balance between the need to raise revenue and the need to reflect other social objectives in its taxation policies. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds. The Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice in this field unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (ibid.; and see also Lindsay, cited above) and subject to the proviso that, in creating and implementing a scheme of taxation, the State must not discriminate between tax-payers in a manner which is inconsistent with Article 14 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55, ECHR 2005-...).\n55. Article 14 safeguards individuals placed in similar positions from discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention and Protocols (see Marckx, \u00a7 32 and Darby v. Sweden, judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 187, \u00a7 31). A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2006-...).\n56. The applicants claim to be in a similar or analogous position to co-habiting married and civil partnership couples for the purposes of inheritance tax. The Government, however, argue that there is no true analogy because the applicants are connected by birth rather than by a decision to enter into a formal relationship recognised by law.\n57. The Court recalls that in Shackell, while observing that there might well be an increased social acceptance of stable relationships outside the traditional relationship of marriage, it found that the situations of married and unmarried heterosexual cohabiting couples were not analogous for the purposes of survivors' benefits, citing the Commission's opinion in Lindsay that \u201c[m]arriage continues to be characterised by a corpus of rights and obligations which differentiate it markedly from the situation of a man and woman who co-habit.\u201d Since the coming into force of the 2004 Act in the United Kingdom, a same-sex couple now also has the choice to enter into a legal relationship designed by Parliament to correspond almost exactly to marriage (see paragraphs 16-18 above).\n58. It is true that the decisions in Shackell and Lindsay were made in the knowledge that a man and a woman outside the prohibited degrees of family relationship are generally free to choose whether or not to take on the \u201ccorpus of rights and obligations\u201d involved in marriage. The applicants, as sisters, do not have this choice, and indeed it goes to the heart of their complaint that, despite their decision to live together in an exclusive relationship for many years, English law does not accord a level of recognition to their co-habitation approaching that given to a married or civil partnership couple. The Court does not, however, have to decide if that lack of choice has any bearing on the question whether, for the purposes of inheritance tax, the applicants can be regarded as being in an analogous position to married and civil partnership couples, because, for the reasons set out below, it considers that, even assuming that the applicants can be compared to such a couple, the difference in treatment is not inconsistent with Article 14.\n59. In this regard, the Court recalls its finding in Shackell that the difference of treatment for the purposes of the grant of social security benefits, between an unmarried applicant who had a long-term relationship with the deceased, and a widow in the same situation, was justified, marriage remaining an institution that was widely accepted as conferring a particular status on those who entered it. The Court decided in Shackell, therefore, that the promotion of marriage by way of the grant of limited benefits for surviving spouses could not be said to exceed the margin of appreciation afforded to the respondent State. In the present case, it accepts the Government's submission that the inheritance tax exemption for married and civil partnership couples likewise pursues a legitimate aim, namely to promote stable, committed heterosexual and homosexual relationships by providing the survivor with a measure of financial security after the death of the spouse or partner. The Convention explicitly protects the right to marry in Article 12, and the Court has held on many occasions that sexual orientation is a concept covered by Article 14 and that differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons by way of justification (see, for example, Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2003-IX and the cases cited therein). The State cannot be criticised for pursuing, through its taxation system, policies designed to promote marriage; nor can it be criticised for making available the fiscal advantages attendant on marriage to committed homosexual couples.\n60. In assessing whether the means used are proportionate to the aim pursued, and in particular whether it is objectively and reasonably justifiable to deny co-habiting siblings the inheritance tax exemption which is allowed to survivors of marriages and civil partnerships, the Court is mindful both of the legitimacy of the social policy aims underlying the exemption, and the wide margin of appreciation that applies in this field (see paragraph 55 above). Any system of taxation, to be workable, has to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups of tax payers (see Lindsay, cited above). The implementation of any such scheme must, inevitably, create marginal situations and individual cases of apparent hardship or injustice, and it is primarily for the State to decide how best to strike the balance between raising revenue and pursuing social objectives. The legislature could have granted the inheritance tax concessions on a different basis: in particular, it could have abandoned the concept of marriage or civil partnership as the determinative factor and extended the concession to siblings or other family members who lived together, and/or based the concession on such criteria as the period of cohabitation, the closeness of the blood relationship, the age of the parties or the like. However, the central question under the Convention is not whether different criteria could have been chosen for the grant of an inheritance tax exemption, but whether the scheme actually chosen by the legislature, to treat differently for tax purposes those who were married or who were parties to a civil partnership from other persons living together, even in a long-term settled relationship, exceeded any acceptable margin of appreciation.\n61. In the circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the United Kingdom cannot be said to have exceeded the wide margin of appreciation afforded to it and that the difference of treatment for the purposes of the grant of inheritance tax exemptions was reasonably and objectively justified for the purposes of Article 14 of the Convention. There has accordingly been no violation of the Article, read in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n##### 1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;\n2. Holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 December 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L. Early Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following dissenting opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) The joint dissenting opinion of Mr Bonello and Mr Garlicki;\n(b) The dissenting opinion of Mr Pavlovschi.\n#### J.C.M.\nT.L.E.\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF\nJUDGES BONELLO AND GARLICKI\n1. We decided to dissent because we are convinced that the prospective imposition of \u201cfull\u201d inheritance tax on the surviving sister violates Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In particular, we are not persuaded by the manner in which the \u201cmargin of appreciation\u201d doctrine has been applied to this case.\nWe do agree that there must be a wide margin of appreciation offered to the national authorities in tax matters. We further agree that any system of taxation, to be workable, has to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups of taxpayers. We would also be prepared to agree that, with regard to tax matters, there may be some kind of presumption that the solutions adopted by the national legislature remain within this margin of appreciation. Such presumption would mean that it is, in principle, the applicant who must demonstrate that the application of the tax legislation in his or her case exceeded the State's margin of appreciation and led to unreasonable und unjustified effects.\nHowever, this \u201cburden of proof\u201d is not unlimited. In our opinion, once an applicant is able to demonstrate that the way in which the tax legislation was applied created a situation of apparent hardship or injustice, the onus shifts towards the Government, who must then show that there were good reasons for their actions. Furthermore, if our Court decides to accept that such a situation of apparent hardship or injustice remains compatible with the Convention standards, it must give a full explanation as to how it applied the \u201cmargin of appreciation\u201d concept.\n2. The majority seems to agree that there has been a marginal situation or an individual case \u201cof apparent hardship or injustice\u201d (paragraph 60) in respect of the applicants. What seems to us, however, to be missing in the majority's position is a full explanation as to why and how such injustice can be justified. A mere reference to the margin of appreciation is not enough. It should also be recalled that, in the absence of such explanation, a problem of discriminatory treatment may arise, even outside the traditional arena of the Convention rights (see, mutatis mutandis, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], cited in paragraph 54 of the majority's judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55).\nThe national legislature is, generally speaking, free to adopt any reasonable policy of inheritance tax exemptions. As long as the United Kingdom confined the exemptions to married couples, such categorisation might have been justified under Article 12 of the Convention. However, once the UK legislature decided to extend the exemption to permanently cohabiting same-sex couples, the problem left the specific sphere of Article 12. Thus, any further categorisation in the area of inheritance tax\u2011exemptions has to satisfy general standards of reasonableness and non\u2011arbitrariness resulting from Article 14. Of course, we do not want to cast doubt upon the reasonableness of extending exemptions to those same sex couples choosing to form a civil partnership and denying such exemption to mixed-sex couples preferring not to enter into any form of official union. But once the legislature decides that a permanent union of two persons could or should enjoy tax privileges, it must be able to justify why such a possibility has been offered to some unions while continuing to be denied to others. The problem of siblings living together permanently did not escape the attention of the UK legislators and an appropriate amendment was proposed by the House of Lords. It was, however, rejected in the House of Commons on the basis of widespread agreement that the Civil Partnership Bill \u201cis not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with [the problem]\u201d (see paragraph 19 of the judgment). Such an approach may have been correct from the perspective of parliamentary technique, but it could not absolve the legislature from providing an equitable solution to the problem at a later stage.\n3. The situation of permanently cohabiting siblings is in many respects \u2011 emotional as well as economical \u2013 not entirely different from the situation of other unions, particularly as regards old or very old people. The bonds of mutual affection form the ethical basis for such unions and the bonds of mutual dependency form the social basis for them. It is very important to protect such unions, like any other union of two persons, from financial disaster resulting from the death of one of the partners.\nThe national legislature may establish a very high threshold for such unions to be recognised under tax exemption laws; it may also provide for particular requirements to avoid fraud and abuse. But unless some compelling reasons can be shown, the legislature cannot simply ignore that such unions also exist.\nThe situation of permanently cohabiting siblings under the UK legislation has also been negatively affected by the fact that \u2013 being within the prohibited degrees of relationship \u2013 they cannot form a civil partnership. In other words, they have been deprived of the possibility of choice offered to other couples. That is why the present case cannot be determined by reference to the Shackell v. the United Kingdom decision (see paragraph 46 of the judgment), since the latter was based on the fact that the persons affected were generally free to choose whether or not to enter into a formal union.\n4. The injustice generally inherent in the UK approach appears particularly striking in the circumstances of this case. Both sisters have already attained a rather advanced age; they have been together for several decades and neither of them has children. It is obvious that the State will be\nable to collect its tax in full upon the death of the surviving applicant. But the State wants to do it twice: first upon the death of the first sister and later by imposing a new inheritance tax on what still remains of the estate. As we see it, this is scarcely compatible with Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. It may also raise problems under Article 8 if the extent of her tax obligations compels the surviving sister to leave her house or otherwise sacrifice the lifestyle to which she has been accustomed.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE PAVLOVSCHI\nThis case confirms, yet again, the truth of the words uttered by Benjamin Franklin many, many years ago, to the effect that \u201cnothing in this world is certain but death and taxes\u201d. Practice shows that this statement is still valid, even in our 21st century.\nThere is a well-known opinion that all judicial decisions can, in theory, be split into four categories: (a) legal and fair; (b) illegal, but fair; (c) illegal and unfair; and (d) legal, but unfair.\nIn my view, the decision reached by the majority in this case may be placed in the fourth category. I am firmly convinced that a judicial decision, which represents, by its very nature, the highest expression of justice, cannot be unfair. Yet I have genuine difficulty in accepting the fairness of the judgment delivered in the case of Burden and Burden v. the United Kingdom.\nUnfortunately, in reaching their conclusion that\n\u201c... the United Kingdom cannot be said to have exceeded the margin of appreciation afforded to it and that the difference of treatment for the purposes of the grant of inheritance tax exceptions was reasonable and objectively justified...\u201d (see paragraph 61),\nthe majority failed to adduce any reason or argument for doing so. This circumstance prevents me from expressing my opinion concerning the legal aspects of the above conclusion.\nTherefore, I will focus only on the issue of the general unfairness of this judgment.\nIn particular, this unfairness leads me to disagree with the judgment and prevents me from sharing the majority's opinion that there has been \u201cno violation\u201d in the instant case.\nIn my opinion, the decisive element in the case before us is the nature of the property belonging to the applicants, and their personal attitude to it.\nHad assets purchased by the applicants during their co-habitation been at stake, I would have had no difficulty in accepting the majority's approach and, moreover, I would have readily agreed that part of such shared assets, inherited by a surviving sibling, could and should be considered as taxable property. In the case before us, however, we are faced with a qualitatively different situation. The case concerns the applicants' family house, in which they have spent all their lives and which they built on land inherited from their late parents. This house is not simply a piece of property - this house is something with which they have a special emotional bond, this house is their home.\nIt strikes me as absolutely awful that, once one of the two sisters dies, the surviving sister's sufferings on account of her closest relative's death should be multiplied by the risk of losing her family home because she cannot afford to pay inheritance tax in respect of the deceased sister's share of it.\nI find such a situation fundamentally unfair and unjust. It is impossible for me to agree with the majority that, as a matter of principle, such treatment can be considered reasonable and objectively justified. I am firmly convinced that in modern society there is no \u201cpressing need\u201d to cause people all this additional suffering.", "001-85728": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SZULC v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n8. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; and Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n9. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n10. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n11. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n12. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WMA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n13. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n14. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n15. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n16. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n17. The Court has examined the present case and finds that the Government have not presented any facts or arguments which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n18. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n20. The applicant claimed compound interest on the sums due for WMA and WBA, at the relevant base rate in each year.\n21. The Government submitted that the calculation including interest which would have been applicable to a woman awaiting payment of benefits amounted to GBP 30,119.53, a sum which had already been accepted and the cheque cleared by the applicant.\n22. The Court considers that the interest rate applied, which is intended to compensate for loss of value of the award over time, should reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest available to investors nationally during the relevant period. It considers that the rate determined by the Court in the case of Runkee and White (cited above, \u00a7 52) and therefore the rate proposed and paid by the Government in the present case, is the more realistic.\n23. In these circumstances, the Court makes no award under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n24. The applicant also claimed GBP 2,250 for administrative charges in relation to forty-five hours of work on his convention application and GBP 25 for postage and incidental charges. Thus, he claimed a total of GBP 2,275 in respect of costs and expenses.\n25. The Government contested the claim on the basis of the Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n26. The Court reiterates that only such costs and expenses as were actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the violation or violations found, and are reasonable as to quantum, are recoverable under Article 41 (see, for example, \u015eahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII). It follows that, in accordance with its case-law, even if the applicant had indeed spent time working on the case, the Court cannot make an award under this head, as this time would not represent monetary costs actually incurred by him (see Buzescu v. Romania, no. 61302/00, \u00a7 114, 24 May 2005, and Lehtinen v. Finland (no. 2), no. 41585/98, \u00a7 57, 8 June 2006). As for the postage costs the Court rejects the claim as the applicant has failed to prove that this sum had actually been incurred.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Decides to declare admissible the remainder of the application;\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n31. 29. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002), and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC] (no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 52\u201154, ECHR 2005-IV).\n32. By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Journal on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n33. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s representative was not duly authorised to introduce the application on behalf of the applicant before the Court and the application should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione personae. In particular, they indicated that the authority form of 15 July 2004 did not contain the representative\u2019s signature.\n34. The applicant contested that argument. He noted that he had signed an authority form for Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent his interests before the Court. He further maintained that Mr A. Cang\u0131 had been representing him since the early stages of the proceedings and that he had not received any instructions from the Court concerning the validity of the submitted authority form.\n35. The Court observes that on 4 August 2004 the applicant\u2019s representative signed and submitted a complete application form on behalf of the applicant along with a power of attorney filled in and signed by the applicant himself.\n36. In these circumstances the Court considers that, by providing the Court with the power of attorney authorising Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent him before the Court, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that he wished Mr A. Cang\u0131 to make an application to the Court on his behalf. It therefore finds that the present application cannot be rejected as incompatible ratione personae pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention, and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. The applicant complained that he had not received a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the presence of a military judge sitting on the bench of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. He further alleged under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that the \u0130zmir State Security Court had sentenced him on the basis of statements obtained in his absence, which he could not challenge during the proceedings against him and that, despite his requests, the court had not heard any witnesses in his favour.\nArticle 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, insofar as relevant, provide:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Independence and impartiality of the State Security Court\n39. The Government submitted that the applicant had been convicted by a State Security Court which had been composed of three civilian judges since the military judge had been replaced before the end of the proceedings. They further maintained that the majority of the proceedings had been conducted by civilian judges and the military judge had not been involved in important interlocutory decisions during the time he served on the bench. The Government finally argued that following the replacement of the military judge, at the hearing of 15 July 1999 the contents of the case\u2011file had been read out to the applicant and the applicant had accordingly been provided with the opportunity to make additional defence submissions.\n40. The applicant maintained his allegations. He argued, in particular, that the \u0130zmir State Security Court had not repeated the acts in which the military judge had participated when the latter was replaced by a civilian judge.\n41. The Court has consistently held that certain aspects of the status of military judges sitting as members of the state security courts rendered their independence from the executive questionable (see \u0130ncal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV, \u00a7 68; and \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, Judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998\u2011VII, \u00a7 39). The Court also found in the \u00d6calan v. Turkey case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114-115) that, when a military judge participated in one or more interlocutory decisions that continued to remain in effect in the criminal proceedings concerned, the military judge\u2019s replacement by a civilian judge in the course of those proceedings before the verdict was delivered, failed to dissipate the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about that trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality, unless it was established that the procedure subsequently followed in the state security court sufficiently allayed that concern.\n42. In the instant case, the Court notes that before his replacement on 15 July 1999, the military judge was present at twelve hearings on the merits. During these hearings, the first-instance court received the statements of another co-accused concerning the applicant\u2019s involvement in the offence and admitted F.A.\u2019s statements into the case file as evidence. The court also carried out some minor procedural acts.\n43. After the replacement of the military judge by a civilian judge, the \u0130zmir State Security Court held twenty-two more hearings on the merits within the course of four years, during which the final submissions of both the public prosecutor and the applicant were taken.\n44. The Court acknowledges that the case was evaluated by three civilian judges for the most part. However, it also observes that the main evidence, consisting of the statements of B.\u04e6. and those made by F.A. during another set of proceedings, was evaluated by the court during the initial stages of the proceedings, in the presence of the military judge. The bench composed of three civilian judges did not take any new decision as regards the admissibility of F.A.\u2019s statements, nor did it order to a re-hearing of B.\u04e6.\n45. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the replacement of the military judge before the end of the proceedings failed to dispose of the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about the trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality (see Aslan and \u015eanc\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 58055/00, 5 December 2006).\n46. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n##### 2. Alleged unfairness of the proceedings\n47. Having regard to the facts of the case and its finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention above and referring to paragraph 52 below, the Court concludes that it is not necessary to make a separate ruling on the merits of the applicant\u2019s remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention concerning his inability to challenge the statements obtained in his absence and to have any witnesses in his favour examined (see Yi\u011fitdo\u011fan v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 72174/10, \u00a7 65, 3 June 2014).\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n48. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n49. The applicant claimed 257,035 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage. The applicant further called on the Court to determine a reasonable sum in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n50. The Government contested these claims submitting that there was no causal link between the violation and the pecuniary damage alleged. The Government further requested the Court to dismiss the applicant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary damage as he had failed to specify an amount.\n51. The Court observes that the applicant did not submit any relevant documents to substantiate his claim for pecuniary damage. It therefore rejects that claim. The Court however finds that he must have suffered pain and distress which cannot be compensated for solely by the Court\u2019s finding of a violation. Having regard to the nature of the violations found, the Court finds it appropriate to award him EUR 6,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n52. The Court further considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the retrial of the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention, should he so request (see Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n53. The applicant also claimed EUR 3,700 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and EUR 4,000 incurred before the Court, particularly in respect of lawyer\u2019s fees. He further requested EUR 421 for other costs and expenses, such as travel expenses, stationery, photocopying, translation and postage. The applicant submitted a breakdown of Mr A. Cang\u0131\u2019s work, which listed the legal activities carried out by the latter and their corresponding fees.\n54. The Government submitted that the requested sums were unsubstantiated.\n55. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the Court notes that the documents submitted by the applicant in support his claims do not contain any invoices in relation to the costs of travel, stationery, photocopying, translation and postage. As for the legal fees incurred before the domestic courts and the Court, the Court notes that in its previous judgments breakdowns of the hours spent by legal representatives were accepted by the Court as proof of the work carried out by them in representing the applicants (see Benzer and Others v. Turkey, no. 23502/06, \u00a7 249, 12 November 2013). In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 2,000 for the proceedings before the Court as well as the domestic courts.\n#### C. Default interest\n56. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Declares, unanimously, the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 taken alone and in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) admissible;\n2. Holds, unanimously, that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the \u0130zmir State Security Court;\n3. Holds, by four votes to three, that there is no need to examine the remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 taken in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds, unanimously,\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amount, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses, unanimously, the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 10 November 2015, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nAbel Campos Paul Lemmens\nDeputy Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) Concurring opinion of Judge Lemmens;\n(b) Joint Statement of dissent of Judges Lemmens, Karaka\u015f and Turkovi\u0107.\nP.L.\n#### A.C.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE LEMMENS\nI have with some hesitation voted with my colleagues in favour of finding a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the lack of independence and impartiality of the \u0130zmir State Security Court.\nThe reasoning of my colleagues is based on the fact that one of the judges of the State Security Court was a military judge.\nThe wording used in the present judgment seems to suggest that whenever a civilian has to stand trial before a court that includes a military judge, he can legitimately fear that the court will be unduly influenced by considerations that have little or nothing to do with the nature of his case. I very much doubt that such a broad approach would be warranted.\nI see a problem under Article 6 \u00a7 1 where the case raises issues touching upon the founding principles of the State or affecting national security. These were the sort of issues that had to be dealt with by the national security court in the case that gave rise to the first judgment of this Court in which the presence of a military judge was criticised (Incal v. Turkey, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 72, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV).\nIn the present case, however, the applicant was charged with trafficking of illegal drugs. It is hard for me to see why he should have specific concerns about the independence and impartiality of the military judge.\nHaving said that, I note that in earlier cases the Court has explicitly stated that an applicant could have legitimate reasons to fear a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of a State security court because of the presence of a military judge, \u201ceven though [he] was appearing before [that court] for organised drug trafficking\u201d (see Canevi and Others v. Turkey, no. 40395/98, \u00a7 34, 10 November 2004, and Canpolat v. Turkey, no. 63354/00, \u00a7 22, 15 February 2007).\nSince it would not be fair to hold differently for the present applicant, who was in the same situation as the applicants in the other cases, I decided in the end to join my colleagues in their finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on this point.\nJOINT PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES LEMMENS, KARAKA\u015e AND TURKOVI\u0106\nWe cannot agree with the majority that there is no need to examine the remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 taken in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention.\nWe think that the applicant\u2019s inability to challenge the statements obtained in his absence and the fact that he was sentenced on the basis of these statements should be also examined by the Court under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d).", "001-76453": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KEEGAN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides for entry and search without a search warrant:\n\u201c(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section ..., a constable may enter and search any premises for the purpose\u2013\n...\n(b) of arresting a person for an arrestable offence;\n...\u201d\n22. Police can also apply to the magistrates\u2019 court for a warrant. The grant of a warrant is subject to the safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 15 provides, inter alia, that the constable must state the ground on which he makes the application and the enactment under which the warrant would be issued; specify the premises to be entered and searched; and identify in so far as practicable the articles or persons sought. Applications are made ex parte and supported by an information in writing. The constable must answer on oath any question put to him by the Justice of the Peace or judge. There is no statutory requirement for the court issuing the warrant to make findings or give reasons for issuing the warrant.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicants complained of the forcible entry by the police to search their home, relying on Article 8 of the Convention which provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his home ....\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder or crime ...\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n24. The applicants asserted that the circumstances in which the police had entered their house and the fact that domestic law permitted that constituted a breach of Article 8. The applicants had contested in the domestic proceedings that the police had been relying on their power under section 17 of the 1984 Act, in respect of which there was no prior judicial control, and, in any event, whether that was the case or not, there was no possibility of bringing a claim for trespass against police officers who entered while in possession of a valid warrant or any possibility of obtaining damages without showing malice on the part of the police. They emphasised that the domestic courts had found that there had been no reasonable and probable cause for obtaining the warrant and it followed that the information supplied to the officers effecting the entry must also have been defective.\n25. The applicants made reference to the lack of judicial supervision of the procedure, drawing attention to the significant gap of time between the alleged offences and the date on which the warrant was obtained and then executed, and submitted that it was clear that there was considerable information which showed that the suspected robber did not live at their address and that they did. Furthermore, they argued that the link between the cash proceeds of the robbery and premises possibly linked to Dean Metcalfe was slight, and that neither was there any urgency preventing recourse to other methods of investigation.\n26. The applicants submitted that the condition of malice was too restrictive a condition in relation to rights as important as the security of the home. It was not the case that every unsuccessful search disclosed a breach of Article 8, but they urged that the proper balancing safeguard should be the consideration of whether there was reasonable and probable cause for the warrant. It was irrelevant that the police executing the warrant acted in good faith as the warrant was sought without adequate investigation.\n##### 2. The Government\n27. The Government submitted that the principles to be found in domestic law struck the right balance between the public interest in the investigation of crime and the rights of those individuals who sought to pursue a private remedy against the police. They argued that the arrest and gathering of evidence against suspects was often difficult, even dangerous, and the courts had to be careful not to impede investigators in the course of their legitimate duties. The absence of a requirement of malice would impose liability for negligence and potentially expose chief constables to the possibility of civil action on almost every occasion when warrants were obtained. The fact that a search proved to be unsuccessful did not in itself give rise to a cause of action. Primary protection was given to a person\u2019s rights in regard to invasion of property by the requirement that a search be on a warrant granted by a judicial officer who must be satisfied that there was reasonable cause. They relied on judicial dicta that this judicial supervision was not merely a rubber stamp, because it was not sufficient for the judge to be satisfied by the officer\u2019s oath that he believed the grounds for the warrant; the cause for the belief also had to appear reasonable to the judge. Further, the grant of warrants was subject to procedural conditions set out in domestic law, warrants could be quashed in proceedings for judicial review, and where the police acted maliciously, they would be liable in damages.\n28. Accordingly, while the Government accepted that the entry and search fell within the scope of protection afforded by Article 8, the measure was justified in the circumstances of the case and by the fact that there were adequate and effective safeguards against abuse. They emphasised that the police were engaged in an investigation into serious criminal offences; there were reasonable grounds to arrest Dean Metcalfe; it was known that he had access to firearms and it was at the very least undesirable to give any warning of entry; the police officer who applied for the warrant genuinely and reasonably believed that stolen cash was on the premises; and the Justice of the Peace was so satisfied on information given on oath. They submitted that it was inherent in any investigation process that circumstances change and errors could arise; however, it was not the case that every change of circumstance should give rise to liability.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. It is not disputed that the forcible entry by the police into the applicants\u2019 home interfered with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that it was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d on a domestic level and pursued a legitimate aim \u2013 the prevention of disorder and crime \u2013 as required by the second paragraph of Article 8. What remains to be determined is whether the interference was justified under the remaining requirement of paragraph 2, namely whether it was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve that aim.\n30. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and in particular that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, for example, Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 130). The Court must accordingly ascertain whether, in the circumstances of the case, the entry into the applicants\u2019 home struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely their right to respect for their home, on the one hand, and the prevention of disorder and crime, on the other (see McLeod v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII).\n31. While a certain margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States, the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 8 are to be interpreted narrowly and the need for measures in a given case must be convincingly established (see Funke v. France, 25 February 1993, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 256\u2011A). The Court will assess in particular whether the reasons adduced to justify such measures were relevant and sufficient and whether there were adequate and effective safeguards against abuse (see, for example, Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, ECHR 2005-IV).\n32. Turning to the present case, the Court recalls that domestic law and practice regulates the conditions under which the police may obtain entry to private premises, either with or without a warrant. In the present case, the police obtained a warrant from a Justice of the Peace, giving information under oath that they had reason to believe the proceeds of a robbery were at the address which had been used by one of the suspected robbers. No doubt was cast, in the domestic proceedings or before the Court, on the genuineness of the belief of the officers who obtained the warrant or those who executed it. If this belief had been correct, the Court does not doubt that the entry would have been found to have been justified.\n33. However, the applicants had been living at the address for about six months and they had no connection whatsoever with any suspect or offence. As the County Court Judge noted, it is difficult to conceive that enquiries were not made by the police to verify who lived at the address the suspected robber had been known to give and that if such enquiries had been properly made (via the local authority or utility companies), they would not have revealed the change in occupation. The loss of the police notes renders it impossible to deduce whether it was a failure to make the proper enquiries or a failure to transmit or properly record the information obtained that led to the mistake that was made. In any event, as found by the domestic courts, although the police did not act with malice and indeed with the best of intentions, there was no reasonable basis for their action in breaking down the applicants\u2019 door early one morning while they were in bed. Put in Convention terms, there might have been relevant reasons but, as in the circumstances they were based on a misconception which could, and should, have been avoided with proper precautions, they cannot be regarded as sufficient (see, mutatis mutandis, McLeod, cited above, where the police did not take steps to verify whether the applicant\u2019s ex-husband had the right to enter her house, notwithstanding his genuine belief, and did not wait until her return).\n34. The fact that the police did not act maliciously is not decisive under the Convention, which aims to protect against abuse of power, however motivated or caused (see, mutatis mutandis, McLeod, cited above, where the police suspected a breach of the peace might occur). The Court cannot agree that limiting actions for damages to cases of malice is necessary to protect the police in their vital function of investigating crime. The exercise of powers to interfere with home and private life must be confined within reasonable bounds to minimise the impact of such measures on the personal sphere of the individual guaranteed under Article 8 which is pertinent to security and well-being (see, for example, Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996\u2011IV). In a case where basic steps to verify the connection between the address and the offence under investigation were not effectively carried out, the resulting police action, which caused the applicants considerable fear and alarm, cannot be regarded as proportionate.\n35. As argued by the applicants, this finding does not imply that any search which proves to be unsuccessful would fail the proportionality test, only that a failure to take reasonable and available precautions may do so.\n36. The Court accordingly concludes that the balance has not been properly struck in the present case and that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. Article 13 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n38. The applicants submitted that they had not had an effective remedy as their civil claim could only succeed if they could prove malice which was too onerous a hurdle. They pointed out that the courts had identified the difficulties for the applicants on the law as it then stood and expressed concern that they did not have a remedy at that time.\n##### 2. The Government\n39. The Government submitted that the applicants had had an effective remedy for their complaints regarding the search as they had been able to take proceedings in the County Court to seek a remedy in damages for the tort of malicious procurement of a warrant, their claims had been heard over several days, evidence had been taken at first instance, and the findings of the County Court Judge had been reviewed on appeal by the Court of Appeal.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n40. Article 13 requires a remedy in domestic law in respect of grievances which can be regarded as \u201carguable\u201d in terms of the Convention (see, for example, Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, \u00a7 52, Series A no. 131). While it does not go so far as to guarantee a remedy allowing a Contracting State\u2019s laws to be challenged before a national authority on the ground of being contrary to the Convention (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 247-C), where an applicant has an arguable claim to a violation of a Convention right, however, the domestic regime must afford an effective remedy (ibid., \u00a7 39).\n41. In light of the finding of a violation of Article 8 above, the complaint is clearly arguable. The question the Court must therefore address is whether the applicants had a remedy at national level to \u201cenforce the substance of the Convention rights ... in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order\u201d (see Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, 30 October 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 117-27, Series A no. 215).\n42. While it is true that the applicants took domestic proceedings seeking damages for the forcible entry and its effect on them, they were unsuccessful. The Court observes that the courts held that it was in effect irrelevant that there were no reasonable grounds for the police action as damages only lay where malice could be proved, and negligence of this kind did not qualify. The courts were unable to examine issues of proportionality or reasonableness and, as various judges in the domestic proceedings noted, the balance was set in favour of protection of the police in such cases. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicants did not have available to them a means of obtaining redress for the interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\n43. There has therefore been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n45. The applicants claimed non-pecuniary damage for the suffering and distress caused by the violations of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention. Mr and Mrs Keegan submitted that they had suffered post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which symptoms had still persisted in March 2001 (intrusive recollections, sleep disturbance, anxiety and depression). Each of the children, assessed in November 2000, also exhibited symptoms consistent with PTSD (for example, Carl, who had previously had borderline learning difficulties, suffered intrusive recollections and showed dissociative behaviours and disrupted development; Michael showed dissociative behaviour, disturbed sleep patterns and extreme mood swings; and Katie and Sophie showed emotional withdrawal, intense bursts of anger, and unusual night-time experiences).\n46. The applicants had been unable to pursue any recommended therapeutic intervention due to their impecuniosity. They claimed that there was a case for a substantial award as the incident had a number of aggravating features, including the lack of effort by the police to establish who was living at the address, the manner of entry into their home, the presence of young children, the absence of any apology and the conduct of the litigation. Accordingly they claimed a sum of 15,000 pounds sterling (GBP) as a total award to the family, with a separate award to each member to reflect the psychiatric and psychological injury suffered, namely, GBP 12,000 to Gerard Keegan, GBP 12,000 to Moira Keegan, GBP 12,000 to Carl Keegan (aged 14 at the time), GBP 8,000 to Michael Keegan (aged nearly 4 at the time), and GBP 7,000 each to Katie and Sophie Keegan (aged two at the time).\n47. The Government referred to the Court\u2019s constant practice in declining to award exemplary or aggravated damages, but in any event pointed out that the entry and search had been carried out in good faith and the police had apologised and withdrawn speedily, the sergeant readily apologising. They submitted that the amounts claimed were significantly out of line with the awards made in previous cases. As contrasted with cases where the awards were for acts going beyond the simple fact of intrusion upon the home (see, for example, Connors v. the United Kingdom, no. 66746/01, 27 May 2004), this case involved an entry lasting only fifteen minutes and the police had arranged for repairs to the door. They considered that no separate award should be made for alleged psychiatric or psychological injury and that the amounts claimed were excessive. Other factors had undoubtedly contributed to the stress suffered by the family (for example, the father\u2019s heavy drinking and the marital breakdown). They submitted that no more than GBP 3,000 should be awarded to the applicants.\n48. The Court notes the violent and shocking nature of the police entry into the applicants\u2019 home. Taking into account the undoubted distress caused to the applicants which has had long-term effects and the medical reports which indicate that they would benefit from therapeutic intervention of various kinds, it awards to the applicants Gerard, Moira and Carl 3,000 euros (EUR) each and to Michael, Katie and Sophie EUR 2,000 each.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n49. The applicants submitted that they were made liable for the costs of the police in the domestic proceedings. As they had legal aid, they did not have to pay unless a court so ordered. These legal costs in theory remained outstanding and the police could apply to the courts for enforcement of their costs if the applicants recovered significant sums of money. They therefore asked that the United Kingdom provide an indemnity in respect of any such claim made by the police or the Legal Services Commission.\n50. As regarded their costs in the Strasbourg proceedings, they claimed GBP 3,250.95 for solicitors\u2019 fees and expenses and GBP 6,315.63 for counsel\u2019s fees, inclusive of value-added tax and taking into account legal aid paid by the Council of Europe.\n51. The Government submitted that no award should be made in respect of any claimed future liability to pay money to the police or the Legal Services Commission as these sums had not been actually incurred. They considered the hourly rates claimed by the applicants\u2019 solicitor (GBP 175) excessive and that this part of the claim should be reduced to GBP 2,000. They also did not accept that it was necessary to brief two counsel in the case and submitted that the 30 hours\u2019 work claimed for October to December 2005 was excessive, particularly since the observations on the merits did not add significantly to their original application and observations. They took the view that no more than GBP 1,500 should have been charged for counsel\u2019s fees.\n52. The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II, and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2000-IX). This may include domestic legal costs actually and necessarily incurred to prevent or redress the breach of the Convention (see, for example, I.J.L. and Others v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 29522/95, 30056/96 and 30574/96, \u00a7 18, 25 September 2001). Since the costs of the applicants\u2019 legal representation in the domestic proceedings were covered by legal aid and there is no existing liability to reimburse these amounts (if this situation were to change the applicants could reapply to this Court), no award is appropriate in that respect.\n53. As regards the costs claimed for the proceedings in Strasbourg, the Court notes the Government\u2019s objections and finds that the claims may be regarded as on the high side, in particular as regards the work of two counsel. Taking into account the amount of legal aid paid by the Council of Europe and in light of the circumstances of the case, the Court awards EUR 9,500 inclusive of VAT for legal costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n54. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) each to Gerard, Moira and Carl Keegan and EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) each to Michael, Katie and Sophie Keegan in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 9,500 (nine thousand five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 18 July 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President", "001-92767": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SZULUK v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The Secretary of State is responsible for the management of the prison system in England and Wales (Prison Act 1952, sections 1 and 4).\n23. Until November 2007 each prison was required to appoint a medical officer (Prison Act 1952, section 7(1)). The medical officer was a prison officer who had to be a registered medical practitioner (Prison Act 1952, section 4). This requirement was removed by section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007 which came into force on 1 November 2007. Prison health care is now generally integrated with, and commissioned by, the National Health Service (NHS).\n24. Section 47(1) of the Prison Act 1952 authorises the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of prisons and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein. Such rules are made by statutory instrument, laid before Parliament, and are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (Prison Act 1952, section 52(1) and the Criminal Justice Act 1967, section 66(4)).\n25. Prisoners are classified in accordance with directions of the Secretary of State (Prison Rules SI 1999/728 rule 7(1)). Prisoners are classified in accordance with PSO 0900. Paragraph 1.1.1 of PSO 0900 contains the definitions of the four categories of prisoner (A, B, C and D). Category A is applied to prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or the security of the State, no matter how unlikely that escape might be, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible. Category B is applied to prisoners for whom the very highest conditions of security are not necessary, but for whom escape must be made very difficult.\n26. Rule 34 of the Prison Rules is headed \u201cCommunications Generally\u201d It provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) Without prejudice to sections 6 and 19 of the Prison Act 1952 and except as provided by these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any person outside the prison, or such person with him, except with the leave of the Secretary of State or as a privilege under rule 8.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, and except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the Secretary of State may impose any restriction or condition, either generally or in a particular case, upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons if he considers that the restriction or condition to be imposed \u2013\n(a) does not interfere with the Convention rights of any person; or\n(b) (i) is necessary on grounds specified in paragraph (3) below;\n(ii) reliance on the grounds is compatible with the Convention right to be interfered with; and\n(iii) the restriction or condition is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved.\n(3) The grounds referred to in paragraph (2) above are \u2013\n(a) the interests of national security;\n(b) the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime;\n(c) the interests of public safety;\n(d) securing or maintaining prison security or good order and discipline in prison;\n(e) the protection of health or morals;\n(f) the protection of the reputation of others;\n(g) maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary; or\n(h) the protection of the rights and freedoms of any person.\n...\n(8) In this rule \u2013\n...\n(c) references to Convention rights are to the Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998.\u201d\n27. Rule 39 of the Prison Rules deals with correspondence with legal advisers and courts and provides that such correspondence may only be opened, read or stopped by the prison governor in accordance with the provision of that rule, namely when the governor has cause to believe either that the correspondence contains an illicit enclosure or that its contents endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature.\n28. Chapter 36.1 of PSO 1000, which was applicable at the relevant time and which dealt with prisoner communications in connection with those who were in Category A prisons, or who were in prisons which held Category A prisoners, provided as follows:\n\u201cPrison management must provide facilities for prisoners to maintain contact with family and friends. Prisoners\u2019 rights to respect for their private and family life and correspondence are also protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Prison Service\u2019s duty to protect the public allows us to interfere in this privacy in order to minimise the possibility that, in communicating with the outside world, prisoners:\n(i) plan escapes or disturbances;\n(ii) jeopardise the security and good order of the prison;\n(iii) engage in offences against criminal law or prison discipline;\n(iv) jeopardise national security;\n(v) infringe the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n29. Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000 read:\n\u201cAll correspondence, other than correspondence protected by PR39 [that is correspondence with legal advisors] or that with the Samaritans, must be read as a matter of routine in the following cases:\n(i) all prisoners of whatever security category, held in a unit which itself holds Category A prisoners.\u201d\n30. Chapter 36.22 continued as follows:\n\u201cRoutine reading is necessary in these cases in order to prevent escape and, in the case of Category A prisoners, in the interests of public safety. It is also necessary in preventing crime and disorder, for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and, in some cases, necessary in the interests of national security or the economic well being of the country.\u201d\n31. PSO 4411 is entitled \u201cPrisoner Communications: Correspondence\u201d. It came into operation on 5 September 2007. So far as is material to the present case it reflects the practice and procedure in operation from 2002 to 2004.\n32. Special treatment was at the relevant time and still is given to various forms of correspondence apart from that with legal advisers, specifically covered by rule 39 of the Prison Rules and that with the Samaritans, specifically mentioned in Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000. Correspondence with, inter alia, the courts, the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors, the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner, the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman, the Probation Ombudsman, the Commission for Racial Equality and MPs are generally treated as confidential.\n33. PSO 4411 introduced a new category of correspondence subject to confidential handling arrangements. Chapter 5.1 includes the Healthcare Commission as one of the bodies with which a prisoner is entitled to correspond confidentially. The Healthcare Commission is the independent watchdog for health care in England. It assesses and reports on the quality of services provided by the NHS and the independent health-care sector.\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n34. Chapter III, paragraph 34 of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) standards published in October 2006 states the following:\n\u201cWhile in custody, prisoners should be able to have access to a doctor at any time, irrespective of their detention regime ... The health-care service should be so organised as to enable requests to consult a doctor to be met without undue delay.\nPrisoners should be able to approach the health-care service on a confidential basis, for example, by means of a message in a sealed envelope. Further, prison officers should not seek to screen requests to consult a doctor.\u201d\n35. Paragraph 50 of the CPT standards provides:\n\u201cMedical secrecy should be observed in prisons in the same way as in the community. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained that the prison authorities had intercepted and monitored his medical correspondence in breach of Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n39. The Government accepted that the checking of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with his external medical specialist amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n40. Relying on the judgment of the Court of Appeal (particularly its findings set out in paragraph 19 above), the Government submitted that the interference was justified and proportionate under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. They argued that the applicable legal framework provided clear and structured guidance on the matter, which paid full regard to the requirements of the Convention. They asserted that the procedure devised was tailored to the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case. Moreover, the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence was limited to the prison medical officer who was himself bound by duties of medical confidentiality. They distinguished the present case, which involved a circumscribed reading of a single category of a prisoner\u2019s correspondence by the prison medical officer, from cases which involved a blanket reading of prisoners\u2019 correspondence (such as Petra v. Romania, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VII, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, 24 February 2005) which had been held to be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.\n41. The applicant argued that the monitoring of his correspondence was disproportionate. There was no suggestion in the Government\u2019s observations of any specific ground to suggest that he was likely to abuse correspondence with his medical specialist. PSO 4411, to which the Government referred as being the policy governing correspondence, recognised that prisoners could correspond on a confidential basis with a number of bodies including the Healthcare Commission (which considered complaints concerning medical treatment) and the Samaritans (who provided counselling for the suicidal). According to PSO 4411, such correspondence could only be opened where there were reasonable grounds to believe that it contained an illicit enclosure.\n42. The applicant further contended that there was an obvious risk that monitoring of medical correspondence would inhibit what a prisoner conveyed, thereby harming the quality of advice received. It was such concerns that had led to legal correspondence being accorded confidentiality. PSO 4411 demonstrated that prison security was not undermined by enabling prisoners to write on a confidential basis to lawyers and other professionals such as the Healthcare Commission. It was difficult to see why the risk of abuse of correspondence with doctors should be any higher than the risk of abuse involved in correspondence with lawyers.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n43. The Court notes that it is clear, and indeed not contested, that there was an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1. Such an interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve them (see, among other authorities, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 61; Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 233; Petrov v. Bulgaria, no. 15197/02, \u00a7 40, 22 May 2008; and Savenkovas v. Lithuania, no. 871/02, \u00a7 95, 18 November 2008).\n44. It further observes that it is accepted by the parties that the reading of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was governed by law and that it was directed to the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (see paragraph 17 above). The issue that falls to be examined is whether the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.\n45. The notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In determining whether an interference is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d regard may be had to the State\u2019s margin of appreciation (see, among other authorities, Campbell, cited above, \u00a7 44; Petrov, cited above, \u00a7 44; and Dickson v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44362/04, \u00a7 77, ECHR 2007\u2011V). While it is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of necessity, the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited for the interference are relevant and sufficient remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention.\n46. In assessing whether an interference with the exercise of the right of a convicted prisoner to respect for his correspondence was \u201cnecessary\u201d for one of the aims set out in Article 8 \u00a7 2, regard has to be paid to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment. Some measure of control over prisoners\u2019 correspondence is called for and is not of itself incompatible with the Convention (see, among other authorities, Silver and Others, cited above, \u00a7 98; Kwiek v. Poland, no. 51895/99, \u00a7 39, 30 May 2006; and Ostrovar v. Moldova, no. 35207/03, \u00a7 105, 13 September 2005). However, the Court has developed quite stringent standards as regards the confidentiality of prisoners\u2019 legal correspondence. In paragraph 43 of its judgment in Petrov (cited above), the Court enunciated its principles as regards legal correspondence in the prison context as follows:\n\u201c... correspondence with lawyers ... is in principle privileged under Article 8 of the Convention and its routine scrutiny is not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client (see Campbell ... \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 48). The prison authorities may open a letter from a lawyer to a prisoner solely when they have reasonable cause to believe that it contains an illicit enclosure which the normal means of detection have failed to disclose. The letter should, however, only be opened and should not be read. Suitable guarantees preventing the reading of the letter should be provided, such as opening the letter in the presence of the prisoner. The reading of a prisoner\u2019s mail to and from a lawyer, on the other hand, should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances when the authorities have reasonable cause to believe that the privilege is being abused in that the contents of the letter endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature. What may be regarded as \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 will depend on all the circumstances but it presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the privileged channel of communication is being abused (see Campbell ... \u00a7 48).\u201d\n47. In the present case, the interference took the form of the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with his external medical specialist, which concerned his life-threatening medical condition. The Court reiterates the Z v. Finland case (25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I), in which it emphasised that:\n\u201c... the protection of personal data, not least medical data, is of fundamental importance to a person\u2019s enjoyment of his or her right to respect for private and family life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Respecting the confidentiality of health data is a vital principle in the legal systems of all the Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is crucial not only to respect the sense of privacy of a patient but also to preserve his or her confidence in the medical profession and in the health services in general.\nWithout such protection, those in need of medical assistance may be deterred from revealing such information of a personal and intimate nature as may be necessary in order to receive appropriate treatment and, even, from seeking such assistance, thereby endangering their own health ...\u201d\n48. Moreover, as the Court has recognised in its case-law under Article 3 of the Convention, notwithstanding the practical demands of imprisonment, detainees\u2019 health and well-being must be adequately served by, among other things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance (see, in this regard, Hurtado v. Switzerland, 28 January 1994, opinion of the Commission, \u00a7 79, Series A no. 280-A, and Mouisel v. France, no. 67263/01, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002\u2011IX). In this context, the Court refers also to the CPT standards as regards the importance of medical confidentiality in the prison context (see paragraphs 34 and 35 above).\n49. Turning to the facts of the case, the Court considers it significant that the applicant is suffering from a life-threatening condition for which he has required continuous specialist medical supervision by a neuro\u2011radiologist since 2002. In this connection, it takes note of the Court of Appeal\u2019s recognition that the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence with his external medical specialist, albeit limited to the prison medical officer, involved an \u201cinescapable risk of abuse\u201d. It further notes that the Court of Appeal was careful not to exclude the possibility that in another case it might be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to a prisoner\u2019s medical correspondence (see paragraph 19 above) and its acceptance that allowing the prison medical officer to read such correspondence might lead him to encounter criticism of his own performance, which in turn could create difficulties in respect of the applicant\u2019s prison life and treatment. It should not be overlooked that although he was a registered medical practitioner, the prison medical officer was, until the coming into force of section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007, a prison officer. This has now changed as all prison health care is now provided by an external NHS general practitioner (see paragraph 23 above).\n50. This being so, the Court notes the applicant\u2019s submission before the domestic courts and before this Court that the monitoring by the prison medical officer of his correspondence with his external medical specialist inhibited their communication and prejudiced reassurance that he was receiving adequate medical treatment while in prison. Given the severity of the applicant\u2019s medical condition, the Court, like Mr Justice Collins upon hearing the applicant\u2019s claim for judicial review, finds the applicant\u2019s concerns and wish to check the quality of the treatment he was receiving in prison to be understandable.\n51. On that account, the Court notes the observations of both Mr Justice Collins and the Court of Appeal that the prison governor\u2019s initial decision to grant the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence confidentiality indicated, or in the exact words of the Court of Appeal, \u201cstrongly suggested\u201d that it \u201cwould be a perfectly reasonable course\u201d (see paragraphs 15 and 17 above). It further takes into consideration the procedure that had been first established by the prison governor on 18 September 2002, whereby the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence would not be read provided that certain conditions were met (see paragraph 10 above). It is accepted that there were never any grounds to suggest that the applicant had ever abused the confidentiality afforded to his medical correspondence in the past or that he had any intention of doing so in the future. Furthermore, the Court considers it relevant that, although the applicant was detained in a high-security prison which also held Category A (high-risk) prisoners, he was himself always defined as a Category B prisoner (for whom the highest security conditions are not considered necessary \u2013 see paragraph 25 above).\n52. Furthermore, the Court does not consider the Prison Service\u2019s arguments as to the general difficulties involved in facilitating confidential medical correspondence for prisoners (see paragraph 14 above) to be of particular relevance to this case. In the present case, the applicant only wished to correspond confidentially with one named medical specialist and the Court of Appeal accepted that her address and qualifications were easily verifiable. Moreover, the medical specialist in question appeared to have been willing and able to mark all correspondence with the applicant with a distinctive stamp, and had demonstrably done so prior to the prison governor\u2019s revision of his decision on 28 November 2002. The Court does not share the Court of Appeal\u2019s view that the risk that the applicant\u2019s medical specialist, whose bona fides was never challenged, might be \u201cintimidated or tricked\u201d into transmitting illicit messages was sufficient to justify the interference with the applicant\u2019s Article 8 rights in the exceptional circumstances of the present case. This is particularly so since the Court of Appeal further acknowledged that although the same risk was inherent in the case of secretarial staff of MPs (see paragraph 18 above), the importance of unimpeded correspondence with MPs outweighed that risk.\n53. In light of the severity of the applicant\u2019s medical condition, the Court considers that uninhibited correspondence with a medical specialist in the context of a prisoner suffering from a life-threatening condition should be afforded no less protection than the correspondence between a prisoner and an MP. In so finding, the Court refers to the Court of Appeal\u2019s concession that it might, in some cases, be disproportionate to refuse confidentiality to a prisoner\u2019s medical correspondence and the changes that have since been enacted to the relevant domestic law. The Court also has regard to the submissions of the applicant on this point, namely that the Government have failed to provide sufficient reasons why the risk of abuse involved in correspondence with named doctors whose exact address, qualifications and bona fides are not in question should be perceived as greater than the risk involved in correspondence with lawyers.\n54. In view of the above, the Court finds that the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence, limited as it was to the prison medical officer, did not strike a fair balance with his right to respect for his correspondence in the circumstances.\n55. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n56. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n57. The applicant claimed 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP) (approximately 11,450 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n58. The Government submitted that the amount claimed was excessive. They noted that in previous Article 8 cases, which involved interference with a prisoner\u2019s correspondence, the finding of a violation was considered sufficient to constitute just satisfaction for the applicant and no damages were awarded.\n59. The Court considers that in the particular circumstances of the case, the finding of a violation would not constitute just satisfaction for non\u2011pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant. Having regard to the violation found and ruling on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see \u010ciapas v. Lithuania, no. 4902/02, \u00a7 30, 16 November 2006, and Zborowski v. Poland (no. 2), no. 45133/06, \u00a7 48, 15 January 2008).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n60. The applicant also claimed GBP 6,253.25 (approximately EUR 7,162) for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n61. The Government contended that the applicant\u2019s claims for legal costs incurred seemed excessive for this type of case, particularly since his solicitors were not based in London. They suggested that the sum of GBP 4,500 (approximately 5,062 EUR) for legal costs would be a more reasonable figure.\n62. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 6,000 for the proceedings before this Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n63. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 2 June 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Lech Garlicki\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-58410": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF SMITH AND FORD v.

Traja, Judges,\nand Mrs S. doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 September 1999,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the above-cited Findlay case (at pp. 272-276, \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n11. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n12. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n13. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n14. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court-martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command.\n15. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court-martial\u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.\n16. Since the applicants\u2019 trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, at p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57).\n17. Section 69 of the Army Act 1955 provides that any person subject to army law who is guilty of any conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline shall, upon conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or any less punishment for which the 1955 Act provides.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. Each of the applicants complained, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that he did not have a fair or public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Article 6 \u00a7 1, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination \u2026 of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing \u2026 by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. \u2026\u201d\nA Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n19. The Court notes the potential penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Smith\u2019s case) and the sentence imposed on Mr Ford (six months\u2019 imprisonment) together with the nature of the charges of which, in particular, Mr Ford was found guilty. It considers that the applicants\u2019 court-martial proceedings involved the determination of charges of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, the Garyfallou AEBE v. Greece judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1977-V, no. 49, p. 1830, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, with further references).\n#### B. Independence and impartiality of the applicants\u2019 courts-martial\n20. The applicants mainly argued that their courts-martial were not independent or impartial and that the proceedings against them were consequently unfair. The Government made no observations on the admissibility of the case except to note that it raised issues similar to those in respect of which the Court had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the above-cited Findlay case. Having reserved their position as to the merits, the Government did not submit any further observations.\n21. The Court recalls that, in the above-mentioned Findlay judgment, the Court held that a general court-martial convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955 did not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality set down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in view, in particular, of the central part played in its organisation by the convening officer. In this latter respect, the Court considered that the convening officer was central to the applicant's prosecution and was closely linked to the prosecution authorities; the Court expressed some concern that the members of the court-martial were subordinate (either directly or indirectly) to the convening officer; and the Court found it significant that the convening officer also acted as confirming officer.\n22. The Court subsequently found a district court-martial convened pursuant to the Air Force Act 1955 to have similar deficiencies (Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1848-52, \u00a7\u00a7 20-44). In particular, it considered that there were no significant differences between the part played by the convening officer in Mr Coyne's court-martial, under the Air Force Act 1955, and in that of Mr Findlay, under the Army Act 1955. While an appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court was open to Mr Coyne, the Court concluded that the organisational defects in the court-martial could not be corrected by any subsequent review procedure because an accused faced with a serious criminal charge is entitled to a first instance tribunal which meets the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In addition, the Court subsequently found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on the same basis in a series of cases involving complaints about the independence and impartiality of army and air force district and general courts-martial convened pursuant to the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 (the Cable and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 February 1999, unpublished).\n23. The Court recalls that in the present case general and district army courts-martial were convened pursuant to the Army Act 1955 to try the applicants. It can find no reason to distinguish the present cases from those of Mr Findlay, Mr Coyne or Mr Cable and Others as regards the part played by the convening officer in the organisation of their courts-martial. Accordingly, the Court considers that the applicants\u2019 courts-martial did not meet the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court also considers that, since the applicants were faced with, inter alia, charges of a serious and criminal nature and were therefore entitled to a first instance tribunal complying with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1, such organisational defects in their courts-martial could not be corrected by any subsequent review procedure.\n24. Accordingly, and for the reasons expressed in detail in the above-cited judgment of the Court in Mr Findlay's case, the Court concludes that the courts-martial which dealt with the applicants\u2019 case were not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n25. The Court is further of the opinion that, since the applicants\u2019 courts-martial have been found to lack independence and impartiality, they could not guarantee either of the applicants a fair trial (the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, Comm. Report, at \u00a7 108).\n#### C. Remaining points at issue\n26. The applicants also complained that their courts-martial were not \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cestablished by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n27. In view of its conclusions at paragraph 24 and 25 above, the Court finds that, in the present case, it is unnecessary also to examine these complaints of the applicants.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n29. Following the decision of the Court declaring the applications admissible, the Court, by letter dated 14 April 1999, requested the applicants to submit by 14 June 1999 their claims for just satisfaction. Although the applicants had claimed just satisfaction, without further elaboration, in their original applications, no claims either for compensation or reimbursement of costs and expenses were submitted in response to the Court\u2019s letter of 14 April 1999.\n30. The Court recalls that it is not required to examine such matters of its own motion and, consequently, finds that it is unnecessary to apply Article 41 in this case (the Huvig v. France judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-B, p. 57, \u00a7 37-38).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that it is not required to apply Article 41 of the Convention in this case.\nDone in English, then sent as a certified copy on 29 September 1999, according to Article 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 et 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt and WMA, constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility of the application\n11. The Government submitted that the Department of Work and Pensions had no trace of a claim ever having been made by the applicant, nor any form of other documentation evidencing the receipt of the application for benefits. Consequently, it did not appear that the applicant ever made a claim and therefore, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law, he was not a victim of the alleged violation.\n12. The applicant submitted that although the Department of Work and Pensions had lost all the documents related to his case, and they had admitted this, this did not mean that he had never claimed such benefits. He submitted to the Registry of the Court a copy of his personal diary which showed a note stating that he had introduced his claim on 2 March 2001. Moreover, he submitted a copy of the rejection letter from the benefits agency dated 28 June 2001.\n13. The Court considers that for the purposes of the present case the applicant has sufficiently proved that he made a formal application to the benefits agency. It will further consider that such claim had been made on 2 March 2001 and therefore within the domestic time-limits for claiming both benefits. Consequently, the application is not incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention or the Protocols thereto.\n14. The Court further finds that the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, nor inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n15. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of WMA refers solely to the period between the date of his wife\u2019s death and 8 April 2001.\n16. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n17. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in the instant case. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to Wpt and WMA of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n18. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n19. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to Wpt and WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n21. In respect of pecuniary damage the applicant claimed GBP 1,000 and GBP 1,078.33 equivalent to the amounts due in respect of Wpt and WMA for the period at issue, respectively. He further claimed interest on the said sums at a rate of 8 %.\n22. The Government did not submit any comments.\n23. The Court considers that the interest rate applied, which is intended to compensate for loss of value of the award over time, should reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest available to investors nationally during the relevant period. It considers that the rate determined by the Court in the case of Runkee and White (cited above, \u00a7 52) is the more realistic.\n24. In the present circumstances and making an award on an equitable basis, the Court awards compensation to the applicant of EUR 3,000 in respect of the refusal to grant him Wpt and WMA up to 8 April 2001 as well as interest on that sum.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n25. The applicant also claimed GBP 2,000 in respect of costs and expenses, plus value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\n26. The Government did not submit any comments.\n27. The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 79, ECHR 1999-II). On the basis of the information in its possession the Court awards the applicant EUR 2,400 for legal costs and expenses, in addition to any VAT that may be payable.\n#### C. Default interest\n28. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Decides to declare admissible the application;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the complaints under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) in respect of pecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(ii) EUR 2,400 (two thousand and four hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 13 January 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-80478": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF RUNKEE and WHITE v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Widow's Pensions 1925-2001\n15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30:\n\u201c[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance: 'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.\nThe secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons' and widows' pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at a reduced rate), whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of WMA.\nIn 1985 the government published a Green Paper on Social Security Reform which pointed out (in paragraph 10.9) that the current system of benefits dated from days when far fewer married women worked:\n'Today two thirds of all married women with children over school age, and over a half of widows between 40 and 60, go to work. The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows' other income, in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children. The Government's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support, and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work.'\nDespite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions, the Social Security Act 1986 made relatively modest adjustments to the system. The 26 week transitional widow's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [Widow's Payment: 'WPt'] of \u00a31,000 substituted. The age at which WP became payable, whether on bereavement or cessation of WMA, was raised to 45 and entitlement to the full rate postponed until 55. These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the 1992 Act.\nThe 1986 changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows. But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that WP should be extended to men. It is true that Cruse, a non-governmental organisation for 'the widowed and their children', which had taken widowers on board in 1980, said in their 1986-87 annual report:\n'We ... continued to press for a widower's pension, based on his wife's national insurance contributions, and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers.'\nBut this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of WP for widowers in Parliament. The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from the European Commission. There had been a Council Directive 79/7/EEC in 1978 on 'the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security' which expressly excluded survivors' benefits. In 1987 the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive (Com (87) 494 Final). It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of the Court of Justice in Razzouk and Beydoun v Commission of the European Communities (Cases 75/82 and 117/82), [1984] ECR 1509, 1530, para 16 (a case concerning survivors' pensions under the Community's own Staff Regulations) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women 'forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure.' Article 4 of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits:\n'and to this end:\n(a) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows;\n(b) or the replacement of widows' benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex.'\nThe House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities (Sub-Committee C) held an inquiry into the proposal in 1989. Miss Joan C. Brown, a writer on social security matters, said in evidence to the Committee that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows. The only way to produce equality was to level down. But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen many years earlier to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children:\n'the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through. This suggests the need to phase out the older widow's pension over a long period\u2014in the order of 10-15 years. Without this, there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of their day and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result.'\nThe Select Committee accepted Miss Brown's evidence and reported (Session 1988-89, 10th Report, HL Paper 51):\n'In the United Kingdom...there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme, irrespective of her earnings, if she is aged 45 or more when her husband dies. This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re-establishing herself in the labour market\u2014whereas a widower's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way.\nThe Committee consider that, despite these difficulties, the concept of equal treatment must require that, eventually, men and women should be provided with survivors' benefits on the same terms. Employment patterns are changing and, if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives, it will make sense for equal survivors' benefits to be available. There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother, rather than the father, becomes the principal breadwinner. It would, however, be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality. To reduce this danger, a substantial period should be allowed\u2014at least 15 years\u2014before Member States are obliged to equalise survivors' benefits. Community law recognises a principle of 'legitimate expectation' which would support this approach.'\nThe Government published its response on 4 April 1990 (Cm 1038). It said at para 15:\n'Within the state social security system the Government do not think there is any merit in introducing a universal state insurance benefit for widowers on a par with those currently provided for widows. To extend the current provisions for widows to widowers would cost about \u00a3350 million a year. The available evidence indicates that widowers are more likely to be in full time work than widows, are more likely to have higher earnings than widows and are less likely to have dependent children. As a consequence the Government have made it clear to the Commission that the equalisation of survivors' benefits should be removed from this draft directive entirely.'\nIn 1991 the Commission withdrew the draft directive pending further consultation with Member States and there has been no further European Union initiative on the question.\n...[O]ver the next few years the question of paying WMA to widowed fathers was raised on more than one occasion (see, for example, a Private Member's Bill introduced by Mr Hartley Booth MP on 13 April 1994 (Hansard HC Debates (6th Series) vol 241, cols 212-213) and a Written Answer by the Secretary of State for Social Security (Hansard HC Deb (6th Series) vol 255, 1 March 1995, col 621)). No one suggested paying WP to widowers or, unsurprisingly, abolishing WP for widows. Cruse said in evidence in these proceedings that Mr Hartley Booth's decision to confine his Private Member's Bill to WMA was 'tactical' but the need for such tactics suggests that there would have been little support for anything more.\nThe abolition of WP came as part of a wider reform of survivorship and other social security benefits in the 1999 Act. It was preceded in 1998 by a Consultation Paper which drew attention to the fact that, in 1995, 7 out of 10 married women worked compared with 1 in 8 in 1946. Half of widows under 60 worked and 47% of widows now had income from occupational pension schemes. The Government took the view that widows without dependent children no longer needed long term support. The extension of WP to men was 'not acceptable': it would cost another \u00a3250 million a year and would mean giving help to people who were, as a class, unlikely to need it.\nBut the abolition of WP was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be a breach of faith to deny it to the widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available. An opposition amendment deferring the abolition of WP until 2020 was defeated but the Government agreed that the changes should not come into force until 9 April 2001 and that the rights of women bereaved before that date should be preserved.\u201d\n#### B. WP under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992\n16. Under Section 38 of the 1992 Act, a woman who had been widowed was entitled to a WP if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a Schedule to the Act; and\n(i) at the date of her husband's death she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65; or\n(ii) she ceased to be entitled to a WMA at a time when she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65.\n17. This benefit was not payable for any period after the widow remarried or in which she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife, or for any period in which she was entitled to a WMA.\n#### C. The position from 9 April 2001\n18. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) came into force on 9 April 2001. Section 54 introduced the Bereavement Payment which replaced the Widow's Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001. Section 55 introduced the Widowed Parent's Allowance. Identical conditions applied as for Widowed Mother's Allowance, except that the new allowance was available to (i) widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001 and who were under pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) at the time of the spouse's death, and (ii) widowers whose wife died before 9 April 2001, who had not remarried and were still under pensionable age on the that day.\n19. Section 55 replaced WP with a Bereavement Allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the spouse's death, where no dependent children existed. The deceased spouse had to have satisfied the relevant contribution conditions and died on or after 9 April 2001. The Bereavement Allowance is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement, but is not payable for any period after the survivor reaches pensionable age or remarries or lives with another person as husband and wife, or for any period for which the survivor was entitled to Widowed Parent's Allowance.\n20. Widows (but not widowers) whose husbands died before 9 April 2001, and who fulfilled the other conditions of entitlement, continued to be eligible for WP.\n#### D. Other survivors' benefits under the 1992 and 1999 Acts\n21. For details of the relevant legislative provisions, see Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 14 November 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 38-40.\n#### E. The House of Lords' judgment in Hooper and Others\n22. On 5 May 2005 the House of Lords delivered a unanimous judgment (cited in paragraph 15 above), in which it found, inter alia, that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards WP from 2 October 2000 (when the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force) onwards was objectively justified and involved no breach of Convention rights.\n23. Lord Hoffmann, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, observed that WP had, for reasons of administrative economy, never been means-tested, but had been paid to older widows because it was thought that, as a class, they were likely to be disadvantaged because it had been the custom for women to give up work when they got married. The same did not apply to widowers. The question was not, therefore, whether there was justification for not paying WP to men, but rather whether there was justification for not having moved faster in abolishing its payment to women. The history of WP (set out in paragraph 15 above) demonstrated that the decision to achieve equality between men and women by levelling down survivors' benefits, subject to vested rights, was by no means easy or obvious. It was true that by 2000 the proportion of older women (50-59) who were \u201ceconomically active\u201d was 65.9% against 72.5% for men. But those figures had to be adjusted to reflect greater part-time working by women (44% as against 9%) and the concentration of women in low-paid occupations. The comparative disadvantage of women in the labour market had by no means disappeared.\n24. It was permissible under Article 14 of the Convention for States to treat groups unequally in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them, and the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in determining social and economic policy. Once it was accepted that older widows were historically an economically disadvantaged class which merited special treatment but were gradually becoming less disadvantaged, the question of the precise moment at which such special treatment was no longer justified was a matter of legislative judgment.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND/OR ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\n25. Article 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 8 of the Convention provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. Widow's Pension\n##### 1. The parties' arguments\n(a) The applicants\n26. The applicants argued that their complaints fell within the ambit of both Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and that Article 14 applied since they had been treated less favourably than women in an analogous situation. The difference in treatment, moreover, lacked objective and reasonable justification.\n27. The Court had repeatedly applied a strict test, requiring very weighty reasons to justify sexual discrimination, even in cases concerning inequalities in a welfare system and thus involving issues of social and economic strategy (see, for example, Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I; Wessels-Bergervoet v. the Netherlands, no. 34462/97, ECHR 2002-IV; Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, ECHR 2002-IV). It would be retrograde and would seriously weaken the protection given to the fundamental principle of equality of treatment between the sexes were the Court now to adopt an approach allowing a broad margin of appreciation to States which maintain sex discrimination in the operation of their social security systems, and the House of Lords in Hooper had been wrong to allow such a broad margin (see paragraphs 22-24 above).\n28. Even where the difference in treatment pursued the aim of positive discrimination, it would still be necessary for the State to show that the discriminatory means were reasonably necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. The existence of \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between the sexes, even if proved, did not without more justify the blanket and unqualified discrimination at issue, where every widower was excluded from entitlement to the pension, and every widow who met the qualifying conditions was entitled, regardless of the individual's financial circumstances. It was fundamental to the principle of equal treatment that every individual was entitled to respect as an individual, and should not be treated as a \u201cstatistical unit\u201d on the basis of a personal characteristic, such as race or sex.\n29. The justifications for the inequality found by the Grand Chamber to apply in Stec did not apply in the present case, since, despite the fact that there was now no significant factual difference between the working lives of men and women, the 1998 Act preserved the discriminatory treatment of widowers bereaved before 1 April 2001. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of Contracting States provided social security benefits to bereaved spouses without sex discrimination, and did so at the time the applications were lodged.\n30. It was accepted that Mr Runkee, who was in receipt of means-tested social security benefits, would not, in his current financial circumstances, have received more money had he been entitled to WP (see paragraph 10 above). However, if his circumstances were to improve and his entitlement to means-tested benefits cease, he would be less well-off than a woman in his position, who would retain the right to WP.\n(b) The Government\n31. The Government asked the Court to follow the House of Lords in Hooper and Others and its own reasoning in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, ECHR 2006-..., to find that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards WP was reasonably and objectively justified.\n32. They also pointed out that a woman receiving the Income Support and other benefits paid to Mr Runkee would not have been entitled to WP.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n33. The Court considers that the applicants' complaints about the non-payment to them of WP fall within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006- ...). Since Article 14 therefore applies, it is not necessary to decide whether the complaints also raise an issue under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see also Willis v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 53, ECHR 2002-IV).\n34. The Court recalls that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not include a right to acquire property. It places no restriction on the Contracting State's freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. If, however, a State does decide to create a benefits or pension scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see the Stec and Others decision, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54-55).\n35. Article 14 does not prohibit a Member State from treating groups differently in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them; indeed in certain circumstances a failure to attempt to correct inequality through different treatment may in itself give rise to a breach of the article. A difference of treatment is, however, discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see the Stec and Others judgment, cited above, \u00a7 51).\n36. The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background. As a general rule, very weighty reasons would have to be put forward before the Court could regard a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of sex as compatible with the Convention. On the other hand, a wide margin is usually allowed under the Convention when it comes to general measures of economic or social strategy. Because of their direct knowledge of their society and its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is in the public interest on social or economic grounds, and the Court will generally respect the legislature's policy choice unless it is \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d (op. cit., \u00a7 52).\n37. The Court notes that the history of WP, as recounted by Lord Hoffmann in the Hooper and Others judgment (see paragraph 15 above), is not disputed by the parties to the instant case. The benefit was first introduced in 1925, in recognition of the fact that older widows, as a group, faced financial hardship and inequality because of the married woman's traditional role of caring for husband and family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. Despite the increase in women entering the workforce over the next sixty years, in 1985, when the Government proposed reforms to the social security system, it was still considered necessary by Parliament to provide support to older widows, only half of whom were in paid employment of any kind. It was not until 1998 that the Government, in a Consultation Paper, proposed the abolition of WP in view of the increasing numbers of women in employment or receiving income from an occupational pension scheme. Even then, the proposal was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows, and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be \u201ca breach of faith\u201d to deny it to widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available. In response to these views, the draft legislation was amended to preserve the rights of women widowed before 9 April 2001 (see paragraph 20 above).\n38. It does not appear that at any stage evidence was presented to the Government or Parliament showing that older widowers without dependent children, as a group, were similarly disadvantaged and in need of special financial help, nor has any such evidence been presented to the Court.\n39. Since WP was not means-tested, it is no doubt true, as the applicants contend, that the pension has been paid to certain widows who were less in need than individual widowers who were denied it. However, means-testing can be uneconomical, and any welfare system, to be workable, may have to use broad categorisations to distinguish between different groups in need (see, mutatis mutandis, Lindsay v. the United Kingdom, no. 11098/84, Commission decision of 11 November 1986, Decisions and Reports 49, p. 181).\n40. At its origin, therefore, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population. The Court considers that, in the light of all the evidence presented to it, this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified (cf. Willis v. the United Kingdom, ECHR 2002-IV, where the benefits in question were designed to ease the financial hardship faced by a spouse in the immediate aftermath of bereavement and to assist the surviving spouse bringing up dependent children alone).\n41. Given the slowly evolving nature of the change in women's working lives and the impossibility of pinpointing a precise date at which older widows as a class were no longer in need of extra help \u2013 a topic debated by Parliament on several occasions during the 1980s and 1990s, whenever reform was proposed \u2013 the Court does not consider that the United Kingdom can be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier (see, mutatis mutandis, the Stec judgment, cited above, \u00a7 64). Moreover, since it was decided to bring about equality through \u201clevelling down\u201d, it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly, by preserving the rights of women widowed before 9 April 2001 (ibid., \u00a7 65).\n42. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow's Pension or equivalent.\n43. In the light of this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Court to determine whether or not, given the sums he receives in means-tested benefits, Mr Runkee can claim to be directly affected by the non-payment of WP (but see Bland v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 52301/99, 19 February 2002).\n#### B. Widow's Payment\n44. Mr Runkee and Mr White complained in addition about the non-payment to them of Widow's Payment.\n45. The Court has already held that the non-payment to a widower of Widow's Payment breaches Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43). The Government have not sought to argue that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to this one-off, lump sum payment intended to assist with additional expenses in the immediate aftermath of the spouse's death, was based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d, and the Court sees no reason to distinguish the present applications from Willis.\n46. Again, it is not, therefore, necessary to consider whether any issue also arises under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (op. cit., \u00a7 53).\n47. In conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n48. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary damage\n49. In respect of pecuniary damage Mr Runkee claimed the following amounts in pounds sterling (GBP):\n(i) GBP 1,000 for Widow's Payment;\n(ii) simple interest at 8%, based on the current statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom, on arrears of all widow's benefits found owing to him from 15 March 1998 until the date of judgment;\nMr White claimed as follows:\n(i) GBP 1,000 for Widow's Payment;\n(ii) GBP 12,167.17 for WP from 16 March 1999 to July 2005, and continuing;\n(iii) simple interest at 8%, based on the current statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom, on arrears of all widow's benefits found owing to him from 8 March 1999 until the date of judgment.\n50. The Government accepted that they should pay GBP 1,000 to each applicant in respect of Widow's Payment, but rejected Mr White's claim for WP. They submitted that, as a matter of domestic practice, the Department of Work and Pensions applied an interest rate based on the yearly Average Retail Shares and Deposits rate supplied by the Building Societies Commission when, exceptionally, a welfare clamant had lost the use of a sum of money as a result of a departmental error. These rates varied from 4.881%, being the highest, in 1998\u20131999 and 2.691%, being the lowest, in 2003-2004. The Government calculated that Mr Runkee should be awarded interest of GBP 266.15 and Mr White should receive GBP 209.51, to cover the period between the refusal of each of their claims and the Government's Observations of 26 July 2005, continuing at the rate of GBP 0.09 per day until the date of judgment or payment, whichever was sooner.\n51. The Court, which has found violations in respect of the denial of Widow's Payment, but no violation because of the lack of WP, awards each applicant the principal sum of GBP 1,000.\n52. In addition, interest can be claimed from the dates on which each recoverable element of past pecuniary damage accrued (see Willis, \u00a7 69). In the present cases, since under national law at the relevant time a widow was not automatically paid the benefit, but had to claim it and to wait for the Benefits Agency to process her claim, the Court takes as the starting point for interest the date of the Benefit's Agency's letter to each applicant informing him that the claim had been refused. An award of pecuniary damages under Article 41 of the Convention is intended to put the applicant, as far as possible, in the position he would have enjoyed had the breach not occurred (see, mutatis mutandis, Kingsley v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 35605/97, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2002-IV). The interest rate applied, which is intended to compensate for loss of value of the award over time, should therefore reflect national economic conditions, such as levels of inflation and rates of interest available to investors nationally during the relevant period (see, for example, Akku\u015f v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, \u00a7 35; Romanchenko v. Ukraine, no. 5596/03, 22 November 2005, \u00a7 30, unpublished; Prodan v. Moldova, no. 49806/99, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004-III (extracts)). In the light of these considerations, the Court considers that the rate proposed by the Government is the more realistic.\n53. It therefore awards EUR 2,025 to Mr Runkee and EUR 1,870 to Mr White in respect of pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Non-pecuniary damage\n54. The applicants did not claim non pecuniary-damage, and the Court does not award any.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n55. The applicants jointly claimed GBP 21,237.63 in respect of costs and expenses, inclusive of value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\n56. The Government submitted that it could not be shown that such costs had indeed been incurred and therefore that the claim should be dismissed in its entirety. They noted that the applicant's legal representatives were a campaigning non-governmental organisation, and that it was unlikely that the applicants would be made to pay such high fees. In any case, they submitted that the sums put forward were excessive and unreasonable. Given that the matters at issue had been extensively aired in domestic proceedings, it was doubtful whether so many hours had been needed to prepare the case and whether it had been necessary to instruct a QC for the purposes of these proceedings.\n57. According to its settled case-law, the Court will award costs and expenses in so far as these relate to the violation found and to the extent to which they have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum (see, among other authorities, Schouten and Meldrum v. the Netherlands, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 304, pp. 28-29, \u00a7 78 and Lors\u00e9 and Others v. the Netherlands, no. 52750/99, \u00a7 103, 4 February 2003). Taking into account all the circumstances, in particular that it has found no violation as regards WP, and that the issues concerning Widow's Payment were established in Willis and were not contested by the Government, it awards the applicants jointly EUR 2,000 for legal costs and expenses, in addition to any VAT that may be payable.\n#### D. Default interest\n58. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in connection with non-entitlement to a Widow's Pension;\n2.

The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14-26, ECHR 2002-IV and Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n10. The applicant complained that British social security and tax legislation discriminated against him on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction both Article 8 of the Convention and/or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n11. The applicant submitted that in 2002 he accepted the Government\u2019s offer of compensation amounting to 742.95 pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) which however did not include interest and did not contain an acceptance that there had been a violation of his rights.\n12. The Government submitted that the payment of monies to the applicant was made as a result of provisions of United Kingdom domestic law of general application, which were quite unrelated to the question raised under the Convention by this complaint. The offer and eventual repayment of the sum equivalent to Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) had been made to the applicant solely because of an administrative error on the part of the Inland Revenue.\n13. The Government submitted that there was no reason why the applicant should have made an application to the Court and remained of the view that the complaint was inadmissible.\n14. The Court notes that the applicant received and accepted the same amount in repayment as he would have received in WBA as a consequence of administrative errors ensuing from his claim.\n15. In these circumstances, the applicant cannot claim to be directly affected by the alleged discrimination between men and women or to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.\n16. Accordingly, the Court finds that there has been no violation of any of the Articles relied on in respect of his complaint regarding WBA.\n#### B. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n17. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n18. By a letter of 11 May 2005 the respondent Government informed the Court that the House of Lords had decided, in relation to the claims for Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (WMA) and Widow\u2019s Payment (WPt), that there was in principle no objective justification at the relevant time for not paying these benefits to widowers as well as widows, but that the Government had a defence under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA). It noted that, in view of this, the multitude of cases before the Court and the fact that the HRA defence was only applicable in the domestic arena, the Government were prepared, in principle, to settle all claims made by widowers against the United Kingdom arising out of the arrangements applicable prior to April 2001 for the payment of WMA and WPt.\n19. By a letter of 15 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s legal representatives informed the Court that Mr Steff had been offered GBP 6,589.14 in respect of his claims for WMA and that he had accepted payment.\n20. The Court takes note of the agreement reached between the parties (Article 39 of the Convention). It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n21. Accordingly this complaint should be struck out of the list of cases.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention and/or Article 8 of the Convention in relation to the complaint concerning Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance;\n2. Decides to strike the remainder of the application out of its list of cases.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 November 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n8. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n9. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n10. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n11. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to Wpt, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n12. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n13. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to Wpt, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Pension\n##### 1. Admissibility\n14. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n15. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n17. In respect of pecuniary damage the applicant claimed the amount due in respect of WP.\n18. The Court has found no violation in respect of the complaint regarding WP. It therefore rejects this claim.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n19. The applicant did not submit any claims under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to declare admissible the complaint relating to the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and inadmissible the remainder of the application;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment;\n4.

The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n11. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n12. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n13. On 10 April 2007 the Registry requested the applicant to confirm by 16 May 2007 whether a friendly settlement had been reached following the decision in Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom (cited above) and if not to submit claims under Article 41 of the Convention. The applicant did not reply, and he did not request an extension of time. On 17 July 2007 the applicant submitted his claim for non pecuniary damage. He requested 1,000 pounds sterling (GBP) for suffering and distress.\n14. Even assuming the applicant had submitted his claims within the time-limit allowed, the Court does not accept that he was caused real and serious emotional damage as a result of being denied a tax allowance of the relatively low value of the WBA (ibid \u00a7 72). No award can accordingly be made under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n15. The applicant made no claim under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The United Kingdom\n##### 1. General provisions on voting in parliamentary elections\n7. Section 1(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if on the date of the poll he is, inter alia, registered in the register of parliamentary electors for a constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Pursuant to section 4(1), a person is entitled to be registered if on the relevant date he is, inter alia, resident in the constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.\n##### 2. Provisions regarding persons with a service qualification\n8. Sections 14-17 of the 1983 Act allow certain categories of persons otherwise eligible to vote who do not fulfill the normal residence requirements to continue to register to vote by making a \u201cservice declaration\u201d. A service declaration can be made by a person who is (a) a member of the forces, (b) employed in the service of the Crown in a post outside the United Kingdom of any prescribed class or description, (c) employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom, or (d) the spouse or civil partner of a person falling within categories (a), (b) or (c) above.\n9. Section 17 provides that where a person\u2019s service declaration is in force, he shall be regarded for the purposes of section 4 of the 1983 Act as a resident on the date of the declaration at the address specified in it (current or former address in the United Kingdom).\n##### 3. Provisions regarding overseas voters\n(a) Current legislation\n10. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 as amended (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d) provides that a person who is a British citizen is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if he qualifies as an overseas elector on the date on which he makes an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d (see paragraph 14 below). A person qualifies as an overseas elector if he is not resident in the United Kingdom and he satisfies one of the sets of conditions set out in the legislation.\n11. The relevant set of conditions for the purpose of the present case is set out in section 1(3):\n\u201cThe first set of conditions is that\u2014\n(a) he was included in a register of parliamentary electors in respect of an address at a place that is situated within the constituency concerned,\n(b) that entry in the register was made on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at that address,\n(c) that entry in the register was in force at any time falling within the period of 15 years ending immediately before the relevant date [i.e. the date on which the applicant makes a declaration under section 2], and\n(d) subsequent to that entry ceasing to have effect no entry was made in any register of parliamentary electors on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at any other address.\u201d\n12. Section 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to be registered pursuant to an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d in the constituency where he was last registered to vote or last resided and the registration officer concerned is satisfied that he qualifies as an overseas elector in respect of that constituency. Where the entitlement of a person to remain registered as an overseas voter terminates, the registration officer concerned shall remove that person\u2019s entry from the register (section 2(2)).\n13. Section 2(3) requires that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration state the date of the declaration, that the declarant is a British citizen, that the declarant is not resident in the United Kingdom, and the date on which he ceased to be so resident.\n14. Section 2(4) stipulates that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration must show which set of conditions in section 1 of the Act the declarant claims to satisfy and, in the case of the first set of conditions, specify the address in respect of which he was registered.\n(b) History to the current legislation\n15. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 Act, no British citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary, i.e. general, election in the United Kingdom, other than members of the armed forces or Crown servants.\n16. In 1982 a parliamentary committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee, published a report on the Representation of the People Acts which recommended that British citizens living in what were then Member States of the European Economic Community should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period. The Government\u2019s response to that report recommended a seven-year limit for all overseas voters, expressing the view that a person\u2019s links with the United Kingdom were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for as long as ten years.\n17. The 1985 Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to British citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous five years. The bill originally proposed a seven-year period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short. Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time-limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with the United Kingdom were also raised.\n18. The five-year period was extended to twenty years by virtue of section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1989. The bill which led to the Act was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time-limit to twenty-five years. During parliamentary debates, the Secretary of State acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut-off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who, although resident abroad for some time, had retained close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and those who had \u201ccut adrift\u201d from such links much earlier. Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views, with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum.\n19. Section 1 of the 1989 Act was subsequently repealed and replaced, with retention of the twenty-year period, by section 8 and Schedule 2 of the Representation of the People Act 2000.\n20. In September 1998 the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on Electoral Law and Administration. It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced. The relevant extract of its report reads:\n\u201c113. The Representation of the People Act 1985 introduced a right for British citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and European elections for up to five years following their move overseas. This period was increased to twenty years under the Representation of the People Act 1989. The peak year for actual registrations under the Act was in 1991 when 34,500 registered; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in 1997, when the total stood at 23,600, followed by a further fall in 1998 to 17,300. Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged as high as three million.\n114. It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote. Professor Blackburn argued that the system meant that \u2018an expatriate living hundreds or thousands of miles away, for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation, carrying memories of British politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live, can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019. Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrat representatives both suggested that 20 years was perhaps too long. Professor Blackburn suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the UK or to an intention to return.\n115. On the other hand, it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue. It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the UK and are those most likely to be planning to return. A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home. The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be lowered but from people who had been resident overseas for more than twenty years arguing for it to be increased.\n116. On balance, we take the view that the twenty year maximum period within which a British citizen overseas may retain the right to vote is excessive and that the earlier limit \u2013 five years \u2013 should be restored.\u201d (emphasis in original; references omitted)\n21. The twenty-year period was subsequently reduced to fifteen years pursuant to section 141(a) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The bill preceding the Act proposed a reduction to ten years. During parliamentary debates, the relevant Government minster explained that the proposed ten-year period struck a balance between the various strongly-held views expressed. During the bill\u2019s passage through the House of Lords, the Government minister proposed an increase to fifteen years in response to concerns aired during the debate. While the minister accepted that the amendment represented a broad-brush approach, he considered it to be the most equitable approach that could be adopted.\n(c) Recent legislative and policy developments\n22. On 6 May 2009, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, an amendment was proposed to raise the period for overseas voting from fifteen to twenty years. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe first is that we live in an era of increasing globalisation and internationalisation of economic activity, a process which has gathered pace since the reduction of the qualifying period in 2000. Secondly, we need to reflect the different nature of modern society and the mobility of populations. Thirdly, I seek to reflect the fact of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union.\u201d\n23. The Government minister defended the fifteen-year period, noting the absence of any compelling argument or evidence that would justify a change. He considered that the focus should be instead on raising the registration rate of overseas voters, noting that fewer than 13,000 overseas voters were registered in England and Wales as of 1 December 2008. The amendment was not passed.\n24. During a short debate in the House of Lords on 2 March 2011 regarding voting arrangements for overseas electors, some members called on the Government to reconsider the fifteen-year period. Attention was drawn to the fact that those who worked abroad for international organisations did not have the same voting rights as members of the armed forces, Crown servants and employees of the British Council, who were not subject to the fifteen-year limit. The Government minister acknowledged that the Government ought to address the issue of overseas votes, noting that of an estimated 5.5 million British citizens resident abroad, only about 30,000 actually voted.\n25. On 27 June 2012, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, an amendment was proposed in the House of Commons to remove the fifteen-year rule. The reasons for the proposed amendment were explained as follows:\n\u201cAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 5.6 million British citizens currently live abroad. The shocking truth is that although, as of last December, about 4.4 million of them were of voting age, only 23,388 were registered for an overseas vote, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 electoral statistics. Out of 4.4 million potential overseas voters, only 23,000-odd are actually registered! ...\n...\nIn most other countries, both developed and emerging, voting rights for parliamentary elections depend solely on nationality, not on an arbitrary time limit. For example, US nationals can vote in presidential, congressional and state elections, regardless of where they reside in the world. Similarly, Australian nationals can vote in the equivalent elections there, no matter where they live. However, the most startling example comes from our nearest neighbour. French citizens in the UK have just elected a new President and taken part in parliamentary elections for one of the 11 Members of Parliament whose job it is solely to represent French people abroad ....\nThe right of Spaniards abroad to vote is enshrined in article 68 of the Spanish constitution. ...\n...\n[A]ll Portuguese citizens living abroad have the same right to vote in Assembly elections as fellow citizens living in their home country. The simple fact is that the citizens of the US, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and all these other countries have better voting rights for their citizens abroad than we do for British citizens living abroad.\nFor a democracy as ancient as ours, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a stain on our democratic principles that our citizens are placed at such a disadvantage when they have moved abroad compared with citizens from those other countries. Her Majesty\u2019s Government is very happy to collect tax from most of the enormous number of people involved, but denies them the vote.\u201d\n...\n\u201cThe states in which these British citizens reside do not allow them to vote as residents, because voting rights are based on nationality and not residence, and they cannot vote in the UK on the basis of the current rule, for which there is no obvious rationale. I challenge the Deputy Leader of the House to state where there would be any disadvantage in abolishing the rule. The consequence of the rule is that many British citizens living abroad are in a state of electoral limbo, unable to participate in any election whatsoever. That seems to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.\u201d\n26. The Government minister replied that the Government would give the issue \u201cserious consideration\u201d. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn.\n27. A similar amendment to the bill was proposed at the Committee stage in the House of Lords on 14 January 2013. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe fundamental issue at stake here is the complete exclusion of so many British citizens living abroad for more than 15 years from the right to vote here. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 55% of those who moved abroad in 2008 did so for work-related reasons, 25% for study and 20% for life in retirement. With an ageing population, and increased opportunities for work and study abroad, people are likely to continue to leave the United Kingdom in substantial numbers. Many of them will reside abroad for more than 15 years. In the countries to which they move, voting rights rest overwhelmingly on nationality, not residence. Apart from some nine Commonwealth countries \u2013 mainly islands in the West Indies \u2013 I understand that no state permits British citizens to vote in its principal national elections. They therefore exist in an electoral limbo.\n...\nWithin the European Union, Britain compares unfavourably with most of its partners. Of the 27 EU members, 22 countries allow their expatriate citizens the right to vote, without any restriction on the period of residence outside the home country. That is apart from Germany, which restricts it to 25 years for expatriates living outside the EU. Just two countries, Denmark and the United Kingdom, restrict the period for voting rights: the UK to 15 years and Denmark to four. In three countries \u2013 Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland and Malta \u2013 expatriates have no right to vote.\nThe world has become much smaller. Britons overseas can listen to our radio via their computer, they can watch British television and read British newspapers just as rapidly as anyone living here, if they subscribe to them electronically. I make a confident prediction that this debate in our House today will attract one of the largest television online audiences abroad that your Lordships have had. I have met many British overseas residents who are as well, if not better, informed about British political affairs than the average voter here. So the old argument about expatriates\u2019 inability to make an informed judgment about the great issues in our political life no longer holds.\u201d\n28. The Government minister responded that the question whether the time limit was appropriate was a wider question which remained under consideration within Government. He noted that there were valid arguments on both sides which needed to be carefully considered alongside any practical issues before any informed decisions could be taken. The amendment was withdrawn but it was subsequently reintroduced on 23 January 2013 during the Report stage of the bill, with further debate taking place. Again, the Government minister indicated that the issue was under consideration by Government and the amendment was withdrawn.\n(d) Judicial review proceedings in Preston ([2011] EWHC 3174 (Admin) and [2012] EWCA Civ 1378)\n29. On 1 December 2011, the High Court handed down judgment in the case of Preston v Wandsworth Borough Council and Lord President of the Council. The claimant was a long-term resident of Spain who sought judicial review of the fifteen-year rule under section 1(3) of the 1985 Act. He argued that he had a directly effective right under European Union law to move to and reside in other Member States and that the fifteen-year rule operated unjustifiably to interfere with the exercise of that right.\n30. The court found that there was no evidential basis for the contention that the fifteen-year rule created a barrier of any kind to free movement. The matter therefore did not fall within the scope of EU law. That being so, the issue of justification did not arise. The court nonetheless indicated that it considered the rule to be a proportionate interference with the right to free movement. It was of the view that the Government were entitled to hold that there was a legitimate objective which the rule was designed to achieve, namely to remove the right to vote from those whose links with the United Kingdom had diminished and who were not, for the most part at least, directly affected by the laws passed there. It observed:\n\u201c44. ... [T]he 15 year rule is designed to establish a test to identify when the absence of residence can fairly be said to have diluted the link with the UK sufficient to justify the removal of the right to vote. The fact that some residence tests do not properly or proportionately measure the strength of commitment does not mean that the adoption of a non-residence test cannot legitimately measure the weakening of commitment. This rule does not fix on non-residence at some particular point in time; it requires a consistent period of non-residence. In my judgment that is a justified way to measure the dilution of commitment. Thereafter the choice of a bright line rule is inevitable. It would in my view be wholly impracticable to adopt a rule which required consideration of the personal circumstances of all potential expatriate voters ...\u201d\n31. The court found that decisions of this Court upholding residence rules were \u201chighly material\u201d (referring to Hilbe v. Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2004\u2011X; and Doyle v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30158/06, 6 February 2007).\n32. Finally, the court considered that the exceptions to the fifteen-year period for certain categories of citizens were justified as the individuals concerned were resident in other States at the request of the United Kingdom in order to look after its national interests.\n33. In its judgment of 25 October 2012, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the High Court on both the question of the existence of an interference with free movement rights and the question of justification. Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment for the court and, on the latter issue, noted in particular:\n\u201c89. First, the Divisional Court was entitled to hold ... that the 15 year rule had a legitimate aim, i.e. to test the strength of a British citizen\u2019s links with the UK over a significant period of time by measuring past commitment to the UK and seeing whether it was sufficiently diminished or diluted to justify removal of the right to vote in parliamentary elections. That aim was legitimate for the purpose of confining the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with an ascertainable, continuing, close and objective connection with the UK, whose government made decisions and whose Parliament passed laws that most directly affected those British citizens resident in the UK.\n90. Secondly, the residence of a citizen is not ... an arbitrary measure of connection with a country: far from it, residence is a relevant, rational and practicable criterion for assessing the closeness of the links between a British citizen and the UK.\n91. Thirdly, the 15 year rule is proportionate to the aim. The length of the period represents three Parliamentary terms. It provides a substantial opportunity for continued voting by British citizens who have moved to reside in another EU country.\n92. Fourthly, it is impracticable for the franchise criteria to be other than bright line rules capable of reasonably consistent practical application. It would be unworkable and disproportionate for the electoral authorities to have to make individual merits assessments of the particular circumstances of each resident in another EU country on a case-by-case basis in order to determine how close a connection there is between that particular individual and the UK despite prolonged absence.\n93. Fifthly, there is no objectionable inconsistency of treatment arising from the excepted categories of overseas residents, such as members of the armed services and Crown employees. In general, they do not move to reside overseas as a voluntary exercise of the right to free movement ... [T]heir circumstances are distinguishable from those of the claimant and others who, like him, have chosen, for their own personal reasons, to live in another Member State.\u201d\n#### B. Italy\n34. A foreign national may acquire Italian citizenship after having been resident in Italy and enrolled in the register of the population of a municipality for four years in the case of nationals of European Union Member States. Citizenship may also be acquired after two years of marriage to an Italian citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted.\n35. A foreign national wishing to acquire Italian citizenship must pay a fee of 200 euros plus a notarial fee of around 15 euros. Application forms are available on the website of the Ministry of Interior. An oath of allegiance to the Italian Republic must be sworn.\n36. All Italian citizens are entitled to vote in Italian parliamentary elections (unless excluded for such things as conviction for certain offences etc.).\n### III. RELEVANT COUNCIL OF EUROPE MATERIAL\n#### A. The Parliamentary Assembly\n37. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (\u201cthe Assembly\u201d) has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations regarding migration issues, including implications for the right to vote.\n38. In 1982 it adopted Recommendation 951 (1982) on voting rights of nationals of Council of Europe member states. The recitals to the recommendation read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Noting that an estimated 9 million nationals of Council of Europe member states do not reside in their country of origin, but in some other member state of the Council;\n2. Considering that these citizens cannot normally take part in elections or referenda held in their country of residence because they are not nationals of that country;\n3. Noting that many of them are also unable, under national legislation, to take part from the territory of their country of residence in elections and referenda held in their country of origin because they have no domicile there;\n...\n5. Considering that millions of nationals of Council of Europe member states are thereby deprived of all civic rights;\n6. Mindful that one of the major concerns of the Council of Europe is to preserve and strengthen democracy and civic rights in member states;\n7. Emphasising the importance it attaches to the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and the First Protocol thereto, particularly freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, as well as the obligation for member states to hold free elections at regular intervals ;\n8. Believing that steps should, therefore, be taken to ensure that every national of a member state is able to exercise his political rights, at least in his country of origin, when he resides in another Council of Europe member state ...\u201d\n39. The Assembly recommended, inter alia, that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201cc. consider the possibility of harmonising member states\u2019 laws in the interests of maintaining the voting rights of their nationals living in another member state with regard to nation-wide elections and referenda, especially with a view to enabling votes to be cast by post or through diplomatic or consular missions;\nd. envisage, if appropriate, the drawing up of a protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights whereby member states would undertake to respect such voting rights for their nationals living in another member state and refrain from hindering the exercise thereof by any measure whatever.\u201d\n40. In Recommendation 1410 (1999) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin, the Assembly noted that \u201cseveral tens of millions\u201d of Europeans were living outside their countries of origin. It continued:\n\u201c3. The Assembly believes that it is in the interest of states to ensure that their nationals continue actively to exercise their nationality, so that it does not become merely passive or essentially a matter of feelings and emotions, and that those nationals can in fact play an important go-between role in host countries, working for better political, cultural, economic and social relations between their country of origin and the country where they live.\u201d\n41. It recommended that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201ciii. prepare a recommendation to the member states with the intention of fostering voluntary participation of expatriates in political, social and cultural life in their country of origin, by instituting and harmonising arrangements for specific representation, such as the unrestricted right to vote or specific parliamentary and institutional representation through various consultative councils ...\n...\nv. invite member states:\n...\nc. to draw up, at national level, an in-depth, systematic analytical description of the respective situations of expatriates, with a view to co-ordinating expatriate relations policies at European level and harmonising arrangements for the institutional and political representation of expatriates, for example by creating a real expatriate status through appropriate legal instruments;\nd. to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interests in policy-making and in national practices concerning:\n...\niii. the right to vote in loco in the country of origin;\niv. the right to vote of expatriates in embassies and consulates in their host countries;\n...\u201d\n42. In Recommendation 1650 (2004) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin, the Assembly noted that the question of links between countries of origins and their expatriates was a relatively new problem, particularly in central and eastern Europe, that relations varied from strong and institutionalised to loose and informal and that there was no harmonisation in this respect at the pan-European level. It continued:\n\u201c4. The Parliamentary Assembly believes that it is in the interest of states to ensure that their expatriate nationals continue to actively exercise their rights linked to nationality and contribute in a variety of ways to the political, economic, social and cultural development of their countries of origin.\u201d\n43. The recommendation further noted that expatriation was the outcome of increasing globalisation and should be viewed as a positive expression of modernity and dynamism, bringing real economic benefit for both host countries and the countries of origin. The Assembly regretted the lack of follow-up to Recommendation 1410 (1999) and recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite member states, inter alia:\n\u201cc. to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interest in policy making, in particular concerning questions of nationality; political rights, including voting rights; economic rights, including taxation and pension rights; social rights, including social schemes; and cultural rights ...\u201d\n44. It further recommended that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201cii. promote an exchange of views and co-operation between Council of Europe member states as regards political, legal, economic, social and cultural measures aimed at strengthening the links between European expatriates and their countries of origin;\niii. review the existing models of relations between expatriates and their countries of origin, with a view to making proposals for the introduction of legally-binding measures at the European level ...\u201d\n45. In Resolution 1459 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote, the Assembly stressed at the outset the importance of the right to vote and to stand in elections as a basic precondition for preserving other fundamental civil and political rights upheld by the Council of Europe. It noted that electoral rights were the basis of democratic legitimacy and representativeness of the political process and considered that they should, therefore, evolve to follow the progress of modern societies towards ever inclusive democracy. It stated:\n\u201c3. The Assembly considers that, as a rule, priority should be given to granting effective, free and equal electoral rights to the highest possible number of citizens, without regard to their ethnic origin, health, status as members of the military or criminal record. Due regard should be given to the voting rights of citizens living abroad.\u201d\n46. The resolution continued:\n\u201c7. Given the importance of the right to vote in a democratic society, the member countries of the Council of Europe should enable their citizens living abroad to vote during national elections bearing in mind the complexity of different electoral systems. They should take appropriate measures to facilitate the exercise of such voting rights as much as possible ... Member states should co-operate with one another for this purpose and refrain from placing unnecessary obstacles in the path of the effective exercise of the voting rights of foreign nationals residing on their territories.\u201d\n47. In conclusion, the Assembly invited the member and observer States concerned to:\n\u201cb. grant electoral rights to all their citizens (nationals), without imposing residency requirements;\nc. facilitate the exercise of expatriates\u2019 electoral rights by providing for absentee voting procedures ...\u201d\n48. In its follow-up Recommendation 1714 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote, the Assembly called upon the Committee of Ministers to appeal to member and observer States to, inter alia, review existing instruments with a view to assessing the possible need for a Council of Europe convention to improve international co-operation with a view to facilitating the exercise of electoral rights by expatriates.\n49. In Resolution 1591 (2007) on distance voting (i.e. the exercise of the right to vote when absent from the country) the Assembly reiterated that the right to vote was an essential freedom in every democratic system and invited member States to introduce distance voting.\n50. In 2008, the Assembly adopted two resolutions and two corresponding recommendations on the state of democracy in Europe, one on specific challenges facing European democracies (Resolution 1617 (2008) and Recommendation 1839 (2008)); and the other on measures to improve the democratic participation of migrants (Resolution 1618 (2008) and Recommendation 1840 (2008)). In these, the Assembly recalled that the essence of democracy was that all those concerned by a decision must be directly or indirectly part of the decision-making process. Accordingly, it considered representativeness to be of crucial importance and found it unacceptable that large groups of the population were excluded from the democratic process. It further observed that there were over sixty-four million migrants in Europe and that their increasing number resulted in a corresponding increasing need to ensure that they were given a \u201cfair share\u201d in the democratic process. While the Assembly focussed on the importance of the participation of migrants in the political process of the host country, it noted that democratic participation for migrants in their countries of origin was also important.\n51. In Resolution 1696 (2009) on engaging European diasporas, the Assembly noted that policies to manage the many challenges and opportunities that had emerged with migration had not kept pace with the development of the phenomenon. It recalled that it had been engaged in dealing with the issue of Europeans living abroad and their links to their homelands for the last fifteen years. It continued:\n\u201c4. The Assembly considers it essential to strike and maintain a proper balance between the process of integration in the host societies and the links with the country of origin. It is convinced that seeing migrants as political actors and not only as workers or economic actors enhances the recognition of their capacity in the promotion and transference of democratic values. The right to vote and be elected in host countries and the opportunity to take part in democratically governed European non-governmental organisations can enable diasporas to endorse an accountable and democratic system of governance in their home countries. Policies that grant migrants rights and obligations arising from their status as citizens or residents in both countries should therefore be encouraged.\n5. The Assembly regrets that, notwithstanding its long-standing calls to revise the existing models of relations between expatriates and their countries of origin, relations between member states of the Council of Europe and their diasporas are far from being harmonised. Many member states from central and eastern Europe are only beginning to recognise the potential development and other benefits of engaging their diasporas in a more institutionalised manner, especially in the context of the current global economic crisis.\n6. The Assembly reiterates that it is in the interest of member states to ensure that their diasporas continue to actively exercise the rights linked to their nationality and contribute in a variety of ways to the political, economic, social and cultural development of their countries of origin. It is convinced that globalisation and growing migration may have an impact on host countries in many positive ways by contributing to building diverse, tolerant and multicultural societies.\u201d\n52. It encouraged member States, as countries of origin, to adopt a number of policy initiatives, including civil and political incentives to:\n\u201c9.1.1. develop institutions and elaborate policies for maximum harmonisation of the political, economic, social and cultural rights of diasporas with those of the native population;\n9.1.2. ease the acquisition or maintenance of voting rights by offering out-of-country voting at national elections;\n...\u201d\n53. The corresponding Recommendation (1890 (2009)) recalled previous recommendations on the subject and instructed the European Committee on Migration to:\n\u201c5.2.1. define the status, rights and obligations of diasporas in Europe, both in their countries of origin and in host countries;\n...\n5.2.3. carry out a study on the experience of member states in setting up government offices for diasporas and the experience of granting voting rights to diasporas and access to other political participation mechanisms;\n...\u201d\n54. Finally, in its Resolution 1897 (2012) on ensuring greater democracy in elections the Assembly called on the member States to foster citizen participation in the electoral process, in particular by, inter alia:\n\u201c8.1.12. enabling all citizens to exercise their right to vote through proxy voting, postal voting or e-voting, on the condition that the secrecy and the security of the vote are guaranteed; facilitating the participation in the electoral process of citizens living abroad, subject to restrictions in accordance with the law, such as duration of residence abroad, whilst ensuring that, if polling stations are set up abroad, their establishment is based on transparent criteria; safeguarding the right to vote of vulnerable groups (people with disabilities, people who are illiterate, etc.) by adapting polling stations and voting material to their needs; abolishing legal provisions providing for general, automatic and indiscriminate disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offences;\u201d\n55. In a number of the above texts, the Assembly also addressed the question of the political participation of migrants in their host countries (see also Recommendation 1500 (2001) on participation of immigrants and foreign residents in political life in the member States).\n#### B. The Committee of Ministers\n56. In its reply to Recommendation 1650 (2004) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin (see paragraphs 42-44 above), the Committee of Ministers commented that the Recommendation raised important and timely issues that should be given serious consideration and therefore brought it to the attention of the governments of the member States. The Committee of Ministers agreed with the Assembly that growing expatriation could be a positive effect of globalisation that contributed to building diverse, tolerant and multicultural societies and recognised the role that migrants could play as vectors of development for both countries of origin and destination. It further agreed that the right balance between the integration into host societies and the links with the country of origin should be achieved and maintained, and charged the European Committee on Migration with examining the concrete mechanisms linked to the migratory processes at the pan-European level, with a view to identifying the legal measures that could contribute to such a balance.\n57. In its reply to Recommendation 1714 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote (see paragraph 47 above), the Committee of Ministers agreed that the abolition of existing restrictions on the right to vote should be the subject of further activities of the Council of Europe. It also agreed that that member States should take measures to facilitate the exercise of voting rights of citizens living abroad, for example through postal, consular or e-voting. However, it did not see any pressing need to elaborate a convention to improve international co-operation on the issue.\n58. In its Final Declaration at the 8th Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for migration affairs regarding \u201cEconomic migration, social cohesion and development: towards an integrated approach\u201d, 4\u20115 September 2008, the Committee of Ministers recognised that the Council of Europe had the potential to develop holistic and coherent policies in the field of migration based on human rights. The thematic report prepared as a main reference for the Conference contained a chapter on migration and social cohesion. On the question of links between the migrant and the country of origin, the report noted:\n\u201c286. At the same time, long term and permanent immigrants increasingly maintain multiple social, economic and political ties and sometimes, dual citizenship with both host and home countries, establishing social and communities that transcend geographical, cultural and political borders. As well, migrants are developing transnational activities and multicultural and multilingual skills. These evolving features of international migration also need to be taken into account in designing policies and practices to ensure social inclusion and cohesion in European countries.\u201d\n59. The report also commented on the emergence of \u201ctransnationalism\u201d in the area of migration:\n\u201c386. ... The term transnationalism refers to processes whereby migrants develop multiple social ties between the society from which they come and the host society, establishing social communities that transcend geographical, cultural and political borders. More people attain multiple identities, transnational relationships and dual or multiple citizenship. An increasing number of migrants are organising their lives with reference to two or more societies and are developing transnational activities and multicultural and multilingual skills. Dual citizenship and European \u2018citizenship\u2019 reflect greater freedom of movement, multicultural societies, employment mobility, activities in two or more countries, and so on. An increasing migratory circulation within the European area reflecting a gradual emergence of cosmopolitan, intercultural and global citizenship.\u201d\n#### C. The Venice Commission\n60. The European Commission for Democracy though Law (\u201cVenice Commission\u201d) adopted Guidelines on Elections at its 51st Plenary Session on 5-6 July 2002. As regards the principle of universal suffrage, the Guidelines provided:\n\u201cUniversal suffrage means in principle that all human beings have the right to vote and to stand for election. This right may, however, and indeed should, be subject to certain conditions ...\u201d\n61. These conditions included conditions of age, nationality, residence and other grounds for deprivation of the right to vote. As to residence, the Guidelines noted:\n\u201ci. A residence requirement may be imposed.\nii. Residence in this case means habitual residence.\niii. A length of residence requirement may be imposed on nationals solely for local or regional elections.\niv. The requisite period of residence should not exceed six months; a longer period may be required only to protect national minorities.\nv. The right to vote and to be elected may be accorded to citizens residing abroad.\u201d\n62. The Guidelines were subsequently included, together with an explanatory report, in the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters adopted by the Venice Commission at its 52nd Plenary Session, 18\u201119 October 2002.\n63. At its 61st Plenary Session, 3-4 December 2004, the Venice Commission endorsed two reports on the Abolition of Restrictions on the Right to Vote in General Elections (CDL-AD (2005) 012 and CDL-AD (2005) 011). One of the reports contained reflections on the right to vote of expatriates in their countries of origin. It noted:\n\u201c28. Most of the citizens in European countries who are temporarily working or staying abroad are registered in the Voters\u2019 List in their country of origin. Those persons are mainly registered according to their last place of residence prior to the departure abroad. This clearly indicates the determination of the legislators to use residence as a basis for allocation of the citizens (who have a right to vote) in the Voters\u2019 List ...\u201d\n64. It continued:\n\u201c31. One question arises from the aforesaid facts: why do most of the states decide to adopt the concept that links the right of a citizen to vote with his or her residence? The methodology of voter registration determines the distribution of the polling stations, and accordingly results in the layout of the electoral districts. But, citizens who are abroad on Election Day in the same Council of Europe member states may exercise their right to vote in the diplomatic and consular offices or by mail. However, according to the legislation of the same countries, they would have to return to their country and cast their vote in the polling station located in the municipality where their last residence was before they left the country. Not all of them might be in a position to do so.\n32. In our view, the country of origin should find a formula to encompass this category of voters who reside abroad and want to exercise their right to vote, but cannot come to their country on Election Day. It is up to the citizen to decide whether or not he/she wishes to exercise this right. The same approach should be applied to the legal requirement for passive suffrage ... This approach is particularly important for countries with a large numbers of its nationals living abroad, who, at the same time, maintain relations with [the] state ...\u201d\n65. A subsequent opinion on the Assembly\u2019s Recommendation 1714 (2005) (see paragraph 47 above) adopted by the Venice Commission in October 2005 noted:\n\u201c3. The right to vote as one of the fundamental political rights is also fundamental for the fulfilment of a number of civil and social rights. At the same time the principles of universality, equality, freedom and secret ballots are the four pillars of the European electoral heritage and they are introduced into the constitutions and electoral legislation of the member and observer states of the Council of Europe. In this respect the abolition of existing restrictions on the right to vote should be of interest to states and it should also serve as an issue for further activities of the Council of Europe and other international organisations.\n4. In some member and observer states of the Council of Europe, the implementation of existing standards and general principles is deeply influenced by customs, and traditions, but most of all by the level of political culture. In a number of cases and situations in countries of Europe and elsewhere various norms and practices have been established which restrict the right to vote to certain categories of people. Such restrictions are problematic from a human rights perspective. European institutions and in this case the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are working to overcome such restrictions.\u201d\n66. The opinion concluded that the Venice Commission was following the achievements in the area of democratic elections and in respect of voting rights as one of the basic human rights which would continue to influence improvements in international and national legislation.\n67. A report on Electoral Law and Electoral Administration in Europe, adopted by the Venice Commission in June 2006 (CDL-AD (2006) 018), noted, on the question of overseas voters:\n\u201c57. External voting rights, e.g. granting nationals living abroad the right to vote, are a relatively new phenomenon. Even in long-established democracies, citizens living in foreign countries were not given voting rights until the 1980s (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom) or the 1990s (e.g., Canada, Japan). In the meantime, however, many emerging or new democracies in Europe have introduced legal provisions for external voting (out-of-country voting, overseas voting). Although it is yet not common in Europe, the introduction of external voting rights might be considered, if not yet present. However, safeguards must be implemented to ensure the integrity of the vote .....\u201d\n68. In June 2011 the Venice Commission adopted a report on Out\u2011of\u2011Country Voting (CDL-AD (2011) 022). The report noted the complexity of the issue of the right to vote of overseas electors and indicated that it was within the scope of the State\u2019s own sovereignty to decide whether to grant the right to vote to citizens residing abroad. The report identified the following arguments in favour of out-of-country voting:\n\u201c63. Legal recognition of citizens is based on the principle of \u2018nationality\u2019. The citizens of a country therefore enjoy, in principle, all the civil rights recognised in that country.\n64. The principle of \u2018out-of-country voting\u2019 enables citizens living outside their country of origin to continue participating in the political life of their country on a \u2018remote\u2019 basis ...\n65. Out-of-country voting guarantees equality between citizens living in the country and expatriates.\n66. It ensures that citizens maintain ties with their country of origin and boosts their feeling of belonging to a nation of which they are members regardless of geographical, economic or political circumstances.\u201d\n69. Discussing the nature and effects of restrictions imposed, the report observed:\n\u201c70. In the case of states whose citizens live abroad in large numbers, to the extent that their votes could appreciably affect election results, it seems more appropriate to provide parliamentary representation for the citizens resident abroad by pre-defined numbers of members of parliament elected by them ...\n71. Given that, in the case of national elections at least, it is exceptional for foreign nationals to have the right to vote in their place of residence, citizens residing abroad are likely to be unable to vote anywhere if they do not have the right to vote in their country of origin. Denying them that right is therefore equivalent to a derogation from the right to vote. It should be possible to find a solution more in keeping with the principle of proportionality by placing certain restrictions on voting rights of citizens residing abroad.\n72. Restrictions of a formal nature or based on the voting procedure make it possible to exclude persons having no ties with the country of origin \u2013 who will probably not vote anyway. The mere fact of requiring registration on an electoral roll, usually for a limited period, calls for action on the part of potential voters.\n73. One might also wonder whether, instead of excluding citizens residing abroad completely, it would not be preferable to restrict the right to vote to those who have lived in the country for a certain time, and to set a limit on the period for which they retain the right to vote after leaving the country ...\u201d\n70. As regards the loss of the right to vote after a specified period of absence, the report added:\n\u201c76. ... it would nevertheless be preferable for the situation to be reconsidered, rather than for provision to be made for the right to vote to be purely and simply lost.\u201d\n71. The report concluded that national practices regarding the right to vote of citizens living abroad and its exercise were far from uniform in Europe. However, developments in legislation pointed to a favourable trend in out-of-country voting, in national elections at least, as regards citizens who had maintained ties with their country of origin. The Commission accepted that the denial of the right to vote to citizens living abroad or the placing of limits on that right constituted a restriction of the principle of universal suffrage. However, it did not consider at this stage that the principles of the European electoral heritage required the introduction of such a right, namely a right for all expatriate citizens to vote in their State of nationality which was subject to no residence qualification. The Commission nonetheless suggested, in view of citizens\u2019 European mobility, that States adopt a positive approach to the right to vote of citizens living abroad, since this right fostered the development of national and European citizenship\n### IV. PRACTICE IN COUNCIL OF EUROPE MEMBER STATES\n72. In the context of the Venice Commission\u2019s recent report on Out-of Country Voting (see paragraphs 68-71 above), a review of the legislation of the law and practice of the forty-seven member States of the Council of Europe was conducted. From this, together with other information at the Court\u2019s disposal, one can draw the following broad picture of the right of non-residents to vote in national elections in the country of citizenship.\n73. In three States, voting by non-residents is either prohibited or restricted to a very limited category of persons (Armenia, Ireland and Malta).\n74. In thirty-five States no restrictions are placed on the period of absence from the country (Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Monaco, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine).\n75. Nine States allow non-residents to vote but impose restrictions. Seven States restrict the right to vote from overseas to those \u201ctemporarily\u201d abroad (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). In three of these States the term \u201ctemporary\u201d is not defined and no particular conditions are imposed on non-residents to demonstrate that their residence abroad is temporary (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia). Two States grant a right to vote to overseas electors abroad for a long-term period but remove the right at the expiry of this period (Germany, which removes the right after twenty-five years, and the United Kingdom).\n76. In the forty-four States which allow some degree of voting by non\u2011residents, the modalities of voting differ, with some allowing votes by post or proxy, others requiring voting in person at embassies and consulates, and yet others permitting voting in person on national territory only (see Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos v. Greece [GC], no. 42202/07, \u00a7\u00a7 32-45, ECHR 2012 for further details).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n77. The applicant complained that he was no longer permitted to vote in United Kingdom elections and alleged a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\u201d\n78. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. Exhaustion of domestic remedies\n79. The Government contended that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as he had failed to seek judicial review of the fifteen-year rule relying on EU law. In this respect, they pointed to the judicial review proceedings in Preston (see paragraphs 29-33 above), which at the time the Government submitted their observations had just been granted leave to proceed.\n80. The applicant denied that any effective remedy to provide redress to his complaint was open to him. He emphasised that the claimant in Preston was not seeking to rely on his right under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to argue that the disenfranchisement was disproportionate, but was relying on general EU law. In any event, he did not agree that the proceedings offered reasonable prospects of success, despite the fact that permission to bring the proceedings had been granted.\n81. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns a provision of primary legislation regulating the right to vote in parliamentary elections. This matter does not fall within the scope of EU law. The claimant in Preston sought to recast the issue as one concerning free movement rights, in order to engage EU law. Ultimately, his attempt failed, with judges in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal ruling that there was no evidence that the fifteen-year rule interfered with free movement rights (see paragraphs 30 and 33 above). In any case, given the reasons handed down by the Court of Appeal (as noted in paragraph 33 above) \u2013 reasons which transcend the issue of freedom of movement \u2013 it cannot be said that the applicant had a reasonable prospect of success had he undertaken to commence judicial review proceedings.\n##### 2. Victim status\n82. The Government contended that the applicant was not a victim of an alleged violation by reason of his failure to apply to be registered to vote in any parliamentary elections since his emigration to Italy. They argued that the position was analogous to that of claims by widowers who complained to the Court about discriminatory access to various benefits (see, inter alia, Cornwell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36578/97, 11 May 1999; and Hooper v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 42317/98, 9 September 2008).\n83. The applicant maintained that he was directly affected by the existence of the impugned law as he had been resident outside the United Kingdom for more than fifteen years.\n84. In order to be able to lodge a petition by virtue of Article 34, a person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals must be able to claim to be the victim of a violation of the rights set forth in the Convention. In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure: the Convention does not envisage the bringing of an actio popularis for the interpretation of the rights it contains or permit individuals to complain about a provision of national law simply because they consider, without having been directly affected by it, that it may contravene the Convention. However, it is open to a person to contend that a law violates his rights, in the absence of an individual measure of implementation, if he is required either to modify his conduct or risks being prosecuted, or if he is a member of a class of people who risk being directly affected by the legislation (see Burden v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 13378/05, \u00a7\u00a7 33 and 34, 29 April 2008; and T\u0103nase v. Moldova [GC], no. 7/08, \u00a7 104, ECHR 2010).\n85. The applicant, who has resided in Italy since 1982, is now precluded from voting in the United Kingdom on account of statutory provisions removing this right from those resident abroad for more than fifteen years. He makes no claim for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage. His interest in pursuing his complaint is limited to the point of principle at issue, namely whether the primary legislation precluding from voting those who, like himself, have been resident outside the United Kingdom for more than fifteen years is compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. No purpose is served by requiring the applicant, prior to lodging his application with this Court, to make an application to be registered as an overseas voter which would be bound to fail in light of the explicit terms of the 1985 Act. There can be no doubt that he belongs to a class of people directly affected by the legislation.\n86. Given the nature of the complaint and the terms of the primary legislation, the applicant can claim to be a victim despite the absence of an individual measure of implementation in his case (see Norris v. Ireland, 26 October 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 31-34, Series A no. 142; and Burden, cited above, \u00a7 34).\n##### 3. Conclusion on admissibility\n87. The complaint cannot be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies or for lack of victim status. No other ground for inadmissibility has been established. The complaint must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n88. The applicant argued that no time-limit should be imposed on the right of EU citizens resident abroad to vote in their country of origin while they retained the nationality of that country. Addressing the Court\u2019s decision in Doyle, cited above, he argued that the four factors identified to justify the residence requirement were now outdated. Globalisation, modern technology and low-cost travel companies made it easier for citizens resident overseas to maintain contact with their country of origin both remotely and by frequent visits. Those who considered a residence requirement to be justified failed to recognise the reality of many nationals living abroad in the exercise of their free movement rights guaranteed by EU law. Despite their residence abroad, journalists could continue to work for British newspapers, businessmen could be employed by British companies and lawyers could provide advice on English law. Notwithstanding long-term residence abroad, British nationals might still be considered domiciled in the United Kingdom, which had particular relevance to matters concerning tax and inheritance.\n89. The applicant maintained that he had retained very strong ties with the United Kingdom. He was a retired serviceman of the British army; he received a pension from the State, paid into a British bank account; he paid tax on his pension to the Inland Revenue; he had family members in the United Kingdom and was a member of a number of clubs and organisations there; and he was the representative in Italy of a British ex-servicemen organisation. He pointed out that he was entitled to return to the United Kingdom to live and to receive treatment from the National Health Service. Matters such as pensions, banking, financial regulations, taxation and health, which were all the subject of political decisions in the United Kingdom, affected him.\n90. The applicant also pointed to the extensive activities of Council of Europe bodies in this area and their support of expatriates\u2019 right to exercise their nationality and right to vote (see paragraphs 38-71 above). He referred to the fact that other member States allowed unrestricted overseas voting by their nationals.\n91. The possibility of obtaining Italian nationality could not render the fifteen-year rule in the United Kingdom a reasonable or proportionate restriction on the right to vote. Although he would be entitled to retain his British nationality, the acquisition of Italian nationality would have other consequences in Italian law that would be detrimental to him, including the application of Italian, rather than English, laws on succession. Further, he disputed the suggestion that he would be able to participate fully in the democratic process in Italy, explaining that he could not read, write or speak Italian to the same level as Italian citizens.\n92. The applicant concluded that the time-limit imposed by the respondent State had the effect of disenfranchising him completely. Disenfranchisement was a very serious breach of human rights, requiring a discernible and sufficient link between the sanction of disenfranchising someone and the circumstances of the person being disenfranchised. He contended that the question went to the heart of a fundamental right, the removal of which had serious consequences. The small number of potential overseas electors who took the time and trouble to register as voters (see paragraphs 20-25 above) demonstrated that there was insufficient public interest to continue to exclude nationals overseas for more than fifteen years from voting. The decision in Doyle required reconsideration because it was clear that the residence requirement in the United Kingdom impaired the essence of the applicant\u2019s fundamental right to vote and resulted in a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n(b) The Government\n93. The Government disagreed that the fifteen-year rule was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. They pointed to the wide margin of appreciation in this area, and the freedom enjoyed by States to organise and run their electoral systems in keeping with their own democratic vision (citing Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2005\u2011IX).\n94. In their view, the Court\u2019s case-law clearly established that a residence condition was, in principle, justifiable as a proportionate limitation on the right to vote (citing Hilbe, Melnychenko and Doyle, all cited above). The fifteen-year period imposed in the United Kingdom reflected the view that during a lengthy period of absence an individual\u2019s connection with the country was likely to diminish. The small number of non-residents who registered to vote provided some support for this view. It was undeniable that a non-resident absent for more than fifteen years was affected by the decisions of Government to a lesser extent than residents. It was therefore legitimate to conclude that the ability of non-residents to have a direct influence on democratic processes by voting should also diminish with time.\n95. The Government accepted that a rule imposing a time-limit after which some individuals were no longer permitted to vote might be perceived as having a more serious impact on some individuals, who had in fact retained strong ties with the United Kingdom. This was an inevitable feature of a rule of general application. The alternative was to impose a restriction which varied in individual cases, perhaps depending on actual ties with the United Kingdom, but this would be very difficult if not impossible to administer fairly in practice. Parliament had considered the issue on a number of occasions. Following extensive consideration of competing arguments, it had concluded that a fixed time-limit was appropriate and had set that time-limit at fifteen years. This was a substantial period and could only be considered a disproportionate restriction on the right to vote on the basis that voting by non-residents must be permitted regardless of the period of absence. This would be a radical departure from the case-law to date and would amount to an unacceptable abrogation of the margin of appreciation in this area.\n96. The Government pointed to the fact that, as regards those who moved elsewhere within the EU, the express policy of EU law was that they should be able to participate in some of the political processes of the State where they were resident, to facilitate their integration into society in that State. In this case, the applicant could also have acquired Italian nationality which would have entitled him to vote in Italian elections, without giving up his British nationality. He therefore had an opportunity to participate fully in the political life of the country which he had chosen to make his home for thirty years.\n97. The various political pronouncements of Council of Europe organs did not call into question the compatibility of the fifteen-year rule. While the Parliamentary Assembly, for example, had called upon member States to facilitate voting by non-residents, it had never suggested that the Convention imposed on them an absolute obligation to do so. On the contrary it recognised that proportionate limitations to the right to vote were permitted. The Committee of Ministers has focussed on the participation by migrants in the political life of countries to which they had emigrated. The Venice Commission had recently concluded that while the denial of a right to vote to citizens living abroad constituted a restriction on the principle of universal suffrage, it did not consider that the principles of the European electoral heritage required the introduction of such a right at this stage.\n98. The Government therefore invited the Court to find no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) General principles concerning the right to vote\n99. Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 enshrines a characteristic principle of an effective political democracy and is accordingly of prime importance in the Convention system. Despite its general formulation, it implies individual rights, including the right to vote and the right to stand for election (see Mathieu\u2011Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, 2 March 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 47 and 51, Series A no. 113; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 63).\n100. However, the rights bestowed by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are not absolute. There is room for implied limitations and Contracting States must be allowed a margin of appreciation in this sphere (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 60). For a measure to be deemed compatible with the right to vote, the Court must be satisfied that the conditions to which the right to vote is made subject do not curtail the right to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see T\u0103nase, cited above, \u00a7 162; Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 62; Yumak and Sadak v. Turkey [GC], no. 10226/03, \u00a7 109, 8 July 2008; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 64).\n101. The concept of \u201cimplied limitations\u201d under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is of major importance for the determination of the relevance of the aims pursued by restrictions on the rights guaranteed by this provision (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt, cited above, \u00a7 52; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 64). Given that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is not limited by a specific list of \u201clegitimate aims\u201d, the Contracting States can justify a restriction by reference to any aim which is compatible with the principle of the rule of law and with the general objectives of the Convention (see \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2006\u2011IV; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 64).\n102. When reviewing the proportionality of the measure, it must be borne in mind that numerous ways of organising and running electoral systems exist. There is a wealth of differences, inter alia, in historical development, cultural diversity and political thought within Europe which it is for each Contracting State to mould into its own democratic vision (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 61; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 66). This means that the proportionality of electoral legislation (and of any limitations on voting rights) must be assessed also in light of the socio-political realities of a given country. Furthermore, since the Convention is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights, the Court must have regard to the changing conditions within the respondent State and within Contracting States generally and respond to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved. In this regard, one of the relevant factors in determining the scope of the authorities\u2019 margin of appreciation may be the existence or non-existence of common ground between, or even trends in, the laws of the Contracting States (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 78, 81 and 84; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 66). Whether the impugned measure has been subjected to parliamentary scrutiny is also relevant, albeit not necessarily decisive, to the Court\u2019s proportionality assessment (see passim Hirst (No. 2), cited above, especially \u00a7\u00a7 78-79; Doyle, cited above; and Alajos Kiss v. Hungary, no. 38832/06, \u00a7 41, 20 May 2010).\n103. Finally, it should be recalled that the right to vote is not a privilege. In the twenty\u2011first century, the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion (see Hirst (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 59; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 67). The exclusion from the right to vote of any groups or categories of the general population must be reconcilable with the underlying purposes of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7 105; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 67). Any general, automatic and indiscriminate departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws it promulgates (see Hirst (no. 2), \u00a7 62; and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 68).\n(b) General principles concerning restrictions imposed by a residence requirement\n104. The Commission, in a series of cases beginning in 1961, found complaints concerning restrictions on the right to vote based on residence to be inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded (see X. and Others v. Belgium, no. 1065/61, Commission decision of 18 September 1961, Yearbook Vol. 4, p. 269; X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 7566/76, Commission decision of 11 December 1976, Decisions and Reports (D.R.) 9, p. 121; X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 7730/76, Commission decision of 28 February 1979, D.R. 15, p. 137; X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 8873/80, Commission decision of 13 May 1982, D.R. 28, p. 99; Polacco and Garofalo v. Italy, no. 23450/94, Commission decision of 15 September 1997, unpublished; and Luksch v. Germany, no. 35385/97, Commission decision of 21 May 1997, D.R. 89B, p. 175).\n105. In subsequent cases before the Court, it also found the imposition of a residence restriction compatible in principle with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Hilbe, Melnychenko and Doyle, all cited above). The justification for the restriction was based on several factors: first, the presumption that non-resident citizens were less directly or less continually concerned with their country\u2019s day-to-day problems and had less knowledge of them; second, the fact that non-resident citizens had less influence on the selection of candidates or on the formulation of their electoral programmes; third, the close connection between the right to vote in parliamentary elections and the fact of being directly affected by the acts of the political bodies so elected; and fourth, the legitimate concern the legislature might have to limit the influence of citizens living abroad in elections on issues which, while admittedly fundamental, primarily affect persons living in the country (see Hilbe and Doyle, both cited above; and Melnychenko, cited above, \u00a7 56). The Court has recognised that it is possible in an individual case that the applicant has not severed ties with his country of origin and that some of the factors indicated above are therefore inapplicable to his case. However, it took the view that the law could not take account of every individual case but must lay down a general rule (see Hilbe and Doyle, both cited above), while never discounting completely the possibility that in some circumstances the application of a general rule to an individual case could amount to a breach of the Convention.\n106. Finally, the Court has previously implied that the ease with which an applicant can acquire the citizenship of his State of residence, and thus exercise his right to vote in that country, may be relevant to the proportionality of a residence requirement in his State of origin (see Doyle, cited above). The possibility of acquiring a new citizenship is not, however, decisive given that the acquisition of such citizenship may have adverse consequences in other areas of one\u2019s life and that an applicant\u2019s interest in casting his vote in the State to which he feels most closely connected must also be given due weight.\n(c) Application of the general principles to the facts of the case\n107. Neither the applicant nor the Government expressly identified the legitimate aim of the restriction in the present case. However, the Court is satisfied that it pursues the legitimate aim of confining the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with a close connection with the United Kingdom and who would therefore be most directly affected by its laws (see paragraphs 30 and 33 above).\n108. The applicant contended that the restriction curtailed his right to vote to such an extent as to impair its very essence and deprive it of its effectiveness. The Court observes that non-residents are permitted to vote in national elections for fifteen years following their emigration. If the applicant returned to live in the United Kingdom, his right to vote as a resident would be restored. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the restriction in the present case impairs the very essence of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. The central question in the present case, therefore, concerns the proportionality of the restriction imposed.\n109. The applicant did not challenge the nature of the restriction imposed in the United Kingdom; nor did he raise any issue as to the meaning and extent of the word \u201cresident\u201d for the purposes of section 1(3) of the 1985 Act; rather, he contended that any restriction on voting in national elections based on residence was of itself disproportionate. In these circumstances, the Court must first examine whether Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 requires Contracting States to grant the right to vote to non-resident citizens (henceforth \u201cnon-residents\u201d) without any restriction based on residence. It must then examine whether in the instant case the current legislation, whereby non-residents are disenfranchised after fifteen years of non-residence, is a proportionate limitation on the right to vote which strikes a fair balance between competing interests. The instant case differs from the case of Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, where the Court was asked to consider whether Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 placed States under an obligation to introduce a system enabling expatriate citizens to exercise their voting rights from abroad.\n110. The principal thrust of the reasoning adopted by the Court in Doyle to justify the imposition of a residence requirement has remained unchanged since the 1976 Commission decision in X. v. the United Kingdom, cited above. However, there is no doubt that since that time, migration has increased significantly. At the same time, the emergence of new technologies and cheaper transport has enabled migrants to maintain a higher degree of contact with their State of nationality than would have been possible for most migrants forty, even thirty, years ago. This has led a number of States including the United Kingdom to amend their legislation to allow for the first time non-residents to vote in national elections (see paragraphs 15 et seq. and 67 above). It is therefore appropriate to examine the nature and extent of the developments at international level and within the laws of the member States in order to determine whether there is any emerging trend or possibly even consensus which might affect the scope of the margin of appreciation afforded to States in this area (see paragraph 102 above).\n111. It is clear that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and more recently the Venice Commission have been active in seeking to resolve questions of participation in the political process and enjoyment of civic rights which arise as a result of migration. As early as 1982, the Assembly recommended that the Committee of Ministers explore the possibility of harmonising member States\u2019 laws in favour of preserving the voting rights of nationals residing abroad (see paragraph 39 above). In 1999 it recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite member States to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interests in policy making and in national practices concerning the right to vote in the country of origin (see paragraph 41 above). It re-examined the matter in 2004 and, as well as reiterating the substance of its 1999 recommendation, recommended that the Committee of Ministers consider making proposals for the introduction of legally-binding measures at European level concerning relations between expatriates and their country of origin (see paragraphs 42-44 above). In a 2005 resolution, the Assembly said that \u201cdue regard\u201d had to be given to the voting rights of non-residents and that member States should take measures enabling non-residents to vote in national elections and facilitating the exercise of the right (see paragraphs 45-47 above). In a follow-up recommendation, it called on States to review existing instruments with a view to assessing the need for a Council of Europe Convention on the matter (see paragraph 48 above). Twin resolutions and recommendations in 2008 again drew attention to the question of democratic participation of non-residents in their countries of origin (see paragraph 50 above). In a 2009 resolution, the Assembly expressed regret at the failure of States to pursue harmonisation in this area and once again encouraged them to adopt policy initiatives to seek harmonisation and to offer out-of-country voting (see paragraphs 51-52 above). However, in a more recent resolution of 2012, the Assembly appears to have accepted that a condition based on residence abroad could be a justified restriction of the right to vote of non\u2011residents (see paragraph 54 above).\n112. While acknowledging the need to address the challenges in the political sphere posed by migration, the Committee of Ministers did not see the need for a Council of Europe instrument governing the right to vote of migrants (see paragraph 57 above).\n113. The Venice Commission Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters 2002 makes reference to the need for certain conditions to be imposed on the right to vote and accepts that a residence requirement may be imposed. It provides that the right to vote \u201cmay\u201d be accorded to citizens resident abroad (see paragraphs 60-62 above). A report endorsed by the Commission in 2004 drew attention to the growing debate regarding the exercise of voting rights by non-residents (see paragraphs 63-64 above). The Commission\u2019s 2006 report on electoral law and administration observed that overseas voting rights were not yet common in Europe (see paragraph 67 above). Its 2011 report on out-of-country voting recognised that the grant of voting rights to non-residents was a matter of State sovereignty. It did, however, list a number of arguments in favour of the grant of such rights and identified the nature and effects of restrictions imposed. Although it indicated that the fixing of a time-limit for retention of the right to vote after a national had emigrated was preferable to the complete exclusion of non-residents, it also indicated that even in the former case, it was preferable that the situation be \u201creconsidered\u201d at the expiry of the time-period rather than that the right to vote simply be lost. Having regard to the lack of uniformity in national practices, the Commission concluded that the principles of the European electoral heritage did not, at this stage, require the introduction of a right to vote for non-residents. It did, however, suggest that States adopt a positive approach to this right, in view of citizens\u2019 European mobility (see paragraphs 68-71 above).\n114. The above review of the activities of Council of Europe bodies demonstrates that there is a growing awareness at European level of the problems posed by migration in terms of political participation in the countries of origin and residence. However, none of the material forms a basis for concluding that, as the law currently stands, States are under an obligation to grant non-residents unrestricted access to the franchise. The differing approaches and political agendas of the various bodies concerned reveal an important disparity in preferred approaches. The material highlights that the question of voting rights for non-residents in their States of nationality must be seen within the larger context of the discussion surrounding migrants\u2019 political activities more generally. A key issue which still has to be addressed within this discussion is whether the focus should be on promoting participation in the State of origin, in the State of residence or in both. Further issues concern the modalities of the exercise by non\u2011residents of the right to vote, which give rise to practical and security considerations. The 2011 report by the Venice Commission made an important contribution to the debate but reached no firm conclusions as to how member States should seek to develop their laws and practices over the coming years. The challenges posed in this regard should not be underestimated.\n115. Turning to the laws and practices of the member States in this area, there is a clear trend in favour of allowing voting by non-residents, with forty-four States granting the right to vote to citizens resident abroad otherwise than on State service (see paragraphs 74-75 above). Of these, thirty-five States do not remove this right once a citizen has resided abroad for a certain period of time (see paragraph 74 above). Nine States appear to limit the right by reference to the duration of the citizen\u2019s stay abroad (see paragraph 75 above). While the majority in favour of an unrestricted right of access of non-residents to voting rights appears to be significant, the legislative trends are not sufficient to establish the existence of any common European approach concerning voting rights of non-residents. In particular, there is no common approach as to the extent of States\u2019 obligations to enable non-residents to exercise the right to vote (see paragraph 76 above and Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 75). It therefore cannot be said that the laws and practices of member States have reached the stage where a common approach or consensus in favour of recognising an unlimited right to vote for non-residents can be identified. Although the matter may need to be kept under review in so far as attitudes in European democratic society evolve, the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in this area still remains a wide one.\n116. As far as the proportionality of the United Kingdom legislation is concerned, it allows non-residents to vote for fifteen years after leaving the country, which is not an unsubstantial period of time. That the applicant may personally have preserved a high level of contact with the United Kingdom and have detailed knowledge of that country\u2019s day-to-day problems and be affected by some of them does not render the imposition of the fifteen-year rule disproportionate: while they require close scrutiny, general measures which do not allow for discretion in their application may nonetheless be compatible with the Convention (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 68, Series A no. 98; Twizell v. the United Kingdom, no. 25379/02, \u00a7 24, 20 May 2008; Amato Gauci v. Malta, no. 47045/06, \u00a7 71, 15 September 2009; Allen and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 5591/07, \u00a7 66, 6 October 2009; Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos, cited above, \u00a7 79; and paragraph 103 above. See also, mutatis mutandis, \u017ddanoka, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114, 115(d) and 128). Having regard to the significant burden which would be imposed if the respondent State were required to ascertain in every application to vote by a non-resident whether the individual had a sufficiently close connection to country (see the findings of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in Preston, in paragraphs 30 and 33 above), the Court is satisfied that the general measure in this case serves to promote legal certainty and to avoid the problems of arbitrariness and inconsistency inherent in weighing interests on a case-by-case basis (see, mutatis mutandis, Evans v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 6339/05, \u00a7 89, ECHR 2007\u2011I). Finally the Court reiterates that the applicant has not raised, not even before the domestic courts, any issue as to the possible uncertainty or lack of clarity as to the meaning and extent of the word \u201cresident\u201d for the purpose of the 1985 Act (see paragraph 109 above and compare Melnychenko, cited above).\n117. There is also extensive evidence before the Court to demonstrate that Parliament has sought to weigh the competing interests and to assess the proportionality of the fifteen-year rule (compare Hirst (No. 2), cited above, \u00a7 79; and Alajos Kiss, cited above, \u00a7 41). The question of non\u2011residents\u2019 voting rights has been examined twice by the Home Affairs Select Committee in the past thirty years, and on both occasions a report was produced (see paragraphs 16 and 20 above). The evolution of views in this area is demonstrated by the fact that the conclusion of the most recent report in 1998 was almost diametrically opposed to the conclusion reached in the Committee\u2019s 1982 report. As a consequence of these reports and of consultation exercises, legislation was introduced in Parliament first granting a right to vote to non-residents in 1985 and subsequently, in 1989 and 2000, amending the time-period (see paragraphs 17-18 and 21 above). The question has been debated in Parliament on several occasions since 2000, in the context of amendments proposed to two draft bills on electoral law and a short debate specifically on non-residents\u2019 voting rights (see paragraphs 22-28 above). This is not to say that because a legislature debates, possibly even repeatedly, an issue and reaches a particular conclusion thereon, that conclusion is necessarily Convention compliant. It simply means that that review is taken into consideration by the Court for the purpose of deciding whether a fair balance has been struck between competing interests. With regard to the issue under examination, the Court notes that the matter remains under active consideration by the present Government of the respondent State.\n118. In conclusion, having regard to the margin of appreciation available to the domestic legislature in regulating parliamentary elections, the restriction imposed by the respondent State on the applicant\u2019s right to vote may be regarded as proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. The Court is thus satisfied that the impugned legislation struck a fair balance between the conflicting interests at stake, namely the genuine interest of the applicant, as a British citizen, to participate in parliamentary elections in his country of origin and the chosen legislative policy of respondent State to confine the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with a close connection with the United Kingdom and who would therefore be most directly affected by its laws. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the present case.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 3 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n119. The applicant further complained under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 that he was being discriminated against compared to British citizens resident in the United Kingdom. Article 14 provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n120. Following communication of his complaint, the applicant contended that he had also been discriminated against on the grounds of age because statistics would \u201cmost probably\u201d show that a very significant percentage of British nationals who moved abroad did so after retirement.\n121. Only differences in treatment based on an identifiable characteristic, or \u201cstatus\u201d, are capable of amounting to discrimination within the meaning of Article 14. Moreover, in order for an issue to arise under Article 14 there must be a difference in the treatment of persons in analogous, or relevantly similar, situations. Such a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, for example, Burden, cited above, \u00a7 60).\n122. In the present case, no evidence of any kind has been provided to substantiate the applicant\u2019s claim that the fifteen-year rule discriminates on grounds of age. The Court is further satisfied that for the reasons discussed in the context of its analysis of the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which justify the imposition of a residence requirement, the applicant cannot claim to be in an analogous position to British citizens resident in the United Kingdom.\n123. The complaints under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 are accordingly manifestly ill-founded and must therefore be rejected as inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF PROTOCOL NO. 4 TO THE CONVENTION\n124. The applicant further argued under Article 2 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention that he had the right to choose his place of residence without being disenfranchised.\n125. The Court notes that the respondent State has not ratified Protocol No. 4 to the Convention. The applicant\u2019s complaint is therefore incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and its Protocols and must therefore be declared inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 (a) and 4.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 May 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Ineta Ziemele\nDeputy Registrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the concurring opinion of Judge Kalaydjieva is annexed to this judgment.\n### I.Z.\n#### F.A.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE KALAYDJIEVA\nI agree with the conclusion that there has been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in the present case and I am fully prepared to accept the position of the United Kingdom Government expressed in paragraphs 94-97 of the judgment as sufficiently convincing for the purposes of the \u201cimplied limitations\u201d under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. The denial of a right to vote to citizens living abroad is clearly based on the assumption that their interest in the national political life is limited and there is nothing in the present case to make this assumption unreasonable. It also seems correct that an effort to afford an individualised approach in the assessment of the level of preserved individual interest in each case would require practical measures, which are not necessarily justifiable in view of their limited overall impact on the manner in which the authorities \u201cundertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature\u201d.\nThe Court has previously expressed its views as follows (see Sitaropoulos and Giakoumopoulos v. Greece [GC], no. 42202/07, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2012):\n\u201cAs regards restrictions on expatriate voting rights based on the criterion of residence, the Convention institutions have accepted in the past that these might be justified by several factors: firstly, the presumption that non-resident citizens are less directly or less continually concerned with their country\u2019s day-to-day problems and have less knowledge of them; secondly, the fact that non-resident citizens have less influence on the selection of candidates or on the formulation of their electoral programmes; thirdly, the close connection between the right to vote in parliamentary elections and the fact of being directly affected by the acts of the political bodies so elected; and, fourthly, the legitimate concern the legislature may have to limit the influence of citizens living abroad in elections on issues which, while admittedly fundamental, primarily affect persons living in the country (see Hilbe, cited above; see also X and Association Y. v. Italy, application no. 8987/80, Commission decision of 6 May 1981, Decisions and Reports (DR) 24, p. 192, and Polacco and Garofalo v. Italy, no. 23450/94, Commission decision of 15 September 1997, DR 90-A, p. 5). More recently, the Court has taken the view that having to satisfy a residence or length-of-residence requirement in order to have or exercise the right to vote in elections is not, in principle, an arbitrary restriction of the right to vote and is therefore not incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Doyle v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30158/06, 6 February 2007).\u201d\nI disagree with the majority on certain aspects of the use of the margin of appreciation as part of the balancing exercise through which they arrived at the conclusion that there had been no violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. In the present case, this was possible as a result of the unnecessary introduction, proprio motu, of some unknown \u201clegitimate aim\u201d and an unjustified opposition between the obligation to organise elections and the individual right to vote.\nIn its earlier cases the Court noted that this provision was:\n\u201cnot limited by any specific list of \u2018legitimate aims\u2019 such as those enumerated in Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention [and that] the Contracting States [were] therefore free to rely on an aim not contained in that list to justify a restriction, provided that the compatibility of that aim with the principle of the rule of law and the general objectives of the Convention [was] proved in the particular circumstances of a case\u201d (see \u017ddanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2006\u2011IV, with further references).\nIn the present case the UK Government indicated practical difficulties, but not necessarily any specific aim pursued by the restriction. The grounds on which the majority found the restriction proportionate to an unknown aim (paragraph 118) thus remain unclear.\nWhile it is true that the Convention bodies have interpreted this provision as one phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Parties to hold elections, but also as implying individual rights, including the right to vote, I am not convinced that this is sufficient to make them \u201ccompeting\u201d (see paragraph 117), or necessarily implies some genuine and inherent \u201cconflict of interest\u201d between an individual\u2019s wish to participate in parliamentary elections in his/her country of origin and the chosen legislative policy to confine the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with a close connection to it (paragraph 118).\nThese two proprio motu steps in the analysis appear to lead the majority to have unnecessary recourse to the tool of the margin of appreciation in their reasoning, rather than relying on the elaborated concept of \u201cimplied limitations\u201d under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. As rightly pointed out by Judge Rozakis in his concurring opinion in the case of Odi\u00e8vre v. France ([GC], no. 42326/98, ECHR 2003\u2011III), \u201cwhen ... the Court has in its hands an abundance of elements leading to the conclusion that the test of necessity is satisfied by itself ... reference to the margin of appreciation should be duly confined to a subsidiary role\u201d.", "001-87512": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF GINNIFER v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Ginnifer v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nLech Garlicki, President,\nNicolas Bratza,\nGiovanni Bonello,\nLjiljana Mijovi\u0107,\nJ\u00e1n \u0160ikuta,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nLedi Bianku, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 June 2008,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n11. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007; and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, 25 July 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n12. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt, WMA, WBA and WP constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n13. By a letter of 12 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr Ginnifer had been offered GBP 6,589.52 in respect of his claims for Wpt and/or WMA including costs and that he had accepted the offer.\n14. The Court takes note of the friendly settlement reached between the parties in respect of Wpt and/or WMA. It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n15. Consequently, this part of the application should be struck out of the list.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Government contested the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s claims on the basis that he had only made an oral claim in respect of WBA and therefore failed to comply with a domestic requirement. According to the relevant domestic provisions telephone claims could be accepted from 1998 onwards, but only if they related to the current year of assessment, namely, the year of assessment in which the claim was made, or the following year. In the present case Mr Ginnifer\u2019s claims for the tax years 1996/97 and 1997/98 referred to previous years\u2019 assessment. Consequently, the applicant cannot claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.\n17. The applicant submitted that the Court should not differ from its holding in White v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.53134/99) in which it rejected the Government\u2019s plea regarding benefit claims not made in the proper format. Indeed, there were no reasons why claims for WBA could not be treated on a par with claims for other bereavement benefits.\n18. The Court recalls that the precise form in which an applicant indicates his intention to claim benefits is not of importance, the central question being whether the applicant has made clear his wish to claim benefits (see White, cited above). The Court finds that in the present case the applicant made clear such intention and he can accordingly claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention for the purposes of Article 34.\n19. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n20. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n21. The Court has examined the present case and finds that the Government have not presented any facts or arguments which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n22. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### C. Widow\u2019s Pension\n23. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of WP or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n24. Consequently, this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n26. The applicant left it to the Court to grant any financial compensation considered equitable.\n27. The Government did not make any submissions on that point.\n28. In its lead judgment regarding WBA the Court found no reason to remedy the inequality of treatment by \u201clevelling up\u201d and awarding the value of tax benefits which had been found to be unjustified. It accordingly made no award in respect of the pecuniary loss alleged to have been suffered (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 69). Moreover, the Court does not accept that the applicant was caused real and serious emotional damage as a result of being denied a tax allowance of the relatively low value of the WBA (ibid \u00a7 72).\n29. The Court finds no reason to depart from these findings and consequently no award can be made under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n30. The applicant also claimed GBP 1,007.80 in respect of costs and expenses, inclusive of value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\n31. The Government did not make any submissions on that point.\n32. The Court reiterates that only such costs and expenses as were actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the violation or violations found, and are reasonable as to quantum, are recoverable under Article 41 (see, for example, \u015eahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII). On the basis of the information in its possession and taking into account that the issues concerning WBA were established in Hobbs (cited above) the Court awards the applicant EUR 600 for legal costs and expenses, in addition to any VAT that may be payable.\n#### C. Default interest\n33. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Disjoins the application from the others to which it was joined;\n2. Decides to strike out the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n3. Declares admissible the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n4. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in connection with the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amount to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 600 (six hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(ii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amount;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6.

Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nEgbert Myjer,\nLuis L\u00f3pez Guerra,\nAnn Power, judges,\nand Santiago Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 November 2008,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Land Code\n15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code.\n16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations.\n17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service.\n18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence.\n19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides:\n\u201cWhen using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...\u201d\nDisturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42.\nSpecial provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement. A tenant's refusal to abide by such provisions and regulations may also constitute a failure to fulfil the requirements for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition.\n20. It follows from section 46 that if the landlord has given notice of cancellation of the tenancy agreement, the tenant may still be entitled to have the agreement extended. However, subsection 1 of section 46 lists a number of situations in which the tenant loses the right to renewal. The first situation, laid down in subsection 1(1), is the forfeiture of the tenancy. Section 42 stipulates the conditions in which a tenancy agreement is deemed to be forfeited, including residential disturbances and failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. The second situation, regulated in subsection 1(2), was relied on by the landlord and applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. It concerns the tenant's neglect of their obligations. If the obligations are neglected to such an extent that it is not reasonable for the tenancy agreement to be extended, the tenant may lose the right to such renewal.\nThe preparatory works to the latter provision state that the requirements of orderliness must be high in order to make it possible for the landlord to maintain the property in good order and condition (SOU 1961:47, pp. 84-85). The interests of the landlord shall be weighed against the reasonableness of the tenancy being terminated. Distressing personal circumstances may be taken into account. The possibility of another flat in the same area should also be considered (Government Bill 1968:91, Appendix A, p. 91).\nExamples of negligence are, for example, failure to pay rent, subletting without permission, refusing to grant the landlord access to the flat, depositing rent without valid reasons, residential disturbances, a failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition, and a breach of clauses in the tenancy agreement.\n#### B. Proceedings in tenancy disputes\n21. A large number of tenancy disputes are examined by the eight regional rent review boards, whose task it is, under section 4 of the Lease Review Boards and Rent Review Boards Act (Lagen om arrenden\u00e4mnder och hyresn\u00e4mnder, 1973:1988), to examine disputes concerning, for example, the terms of a tenancy and disputes relating to the renewal of a tenancy agreement. A decision by a Rent Review Board in a renewal dispute, as in the present case, can be appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal, in accordance with the Land Code, Chapter 12, section 70 in conjunction with section 49. No appeal lies against the court's decision, as provided for in section 10 of the Svea Court of Appeal Rent Cases Judicial Procedure Act (Lagen om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i vissa hyresm\u00e5l i Svea hovr\u00e4tt, 1994:831).\n#### C. Constitutional provisions on freedom of expression and freedom of information\n22. Chapter 1, section 3, subsection 3 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) states the following:\n\u201cSubject to any contrary provision of this Constitutional Law neither public authorities nor other public bodies shall prohibit or prevent the possession or employment of such technical aids as are necessary to receive radio programmes or to view or hear the content of technical recordings on grounds of the content of a radio programme or technical recording,.The same shall apply to any ban on the construction of landline networks for the transmission of radio programmes.\u201d\n23. Chapter 2, section 1, subsection 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201cEvery citizen shall be guaranteed the following rights and freedoms in his relations with the public institutions:\n1. freedom of expression: that is, the freedom to communicate information and express thoughts, opinions and sentiments, whether orally, pictorially, in writing, or in any other way;\n2. freedom of information: that is, the freedom to procure and receive information and otherwise acquaint oneself with the utterances of others;\n...\u201d\nSection 12 provides that the enumerated rights and freedoms may be restricted only to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society. The restriction may never go beyond what is necessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free formation of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy. Furthermore, no restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious, cultural or other such opinion. Under section 13, freedom of expression and information can only be restricted on grounds of national security, national provision of supplies, public order and safety, the good name of an individual, the sanctity of private life, and the prevention and prosecution of crime. Freedom of expression may also be restricted in commercial activities.\n24. The Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression and the Instrument of Government apply to the relationship between individuals and public bodies. They do not apply to relationships between individuals.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicants complained that their freedom to receive information had been breached because the restrictions imposed on them either had not been prescribed by law or had been more far-reaching than necessary in a democratic society. Moreover, they claimed that the consequences \u2013 the eviction from their flat and the move to another town \u2013 had been disproportionate to the aims pursued. They relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n#### A. The parties' submissions\n26. The Government submitted that the complaint was incompatible ratione materiae or manifestly ill-founded. They argued that the dispute in the case had been limited to the question of the actual positioning of the satellite dish, having regard, primarily, to contractual obligations. The alleged interference had not arisen as an effect of a ruling by a public authority on the right to receive information or even the right to use or own a satellite dish. Instead, it had come about only as an effect of the Court of Appeal's interpretation and application of an obligation in a contract between two private parties within the framework of private litigation. In any event, the Swedish authorities would only be responsible to the extent that the State had a positive obligation to protect the rights of the applicants in a case of this nature. In this connection the Government were of the opinion that the Court of Appeal had struck a fair balance between the competing interests of the landlord and the applicants and that there did not exist a positive obligation to protect the applicants' right to receive information from the interference of others. There had therefore not been an interference by a public authority within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention.\n27. The Government argued that were the Court to find that Article 10 was applicable and had been infringed, the interference in question was prescribed by law, specifically Chapter 12 of the Land Code, and that it served the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others, including those of the landlord, other tenants and third parties. As to the question whether the measure had been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10, they claimed that a fair balance had been struck between the landlord's right to property and its interest in maintaining order and good conditions on the property, on the one hand, and the applicants' right to receive information by means of a private satellite dish, on the other. Moreover, the proceedings had been fair at every level, the two instances involved having given extensive and detailed reasons after holding hearings and inspecting the satellite installation in question. Thus, having regard also to the margin of appreciation, the alleged interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and \u201cnecessary\u201d in terms of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n28. The applicants submitted that the grounds for contesting the landlord's action had not been only their denial that the positioning of the satellite was in breach of the lease, but also that that action infringed their right to freedom of information under the Swedish Constitution and Article 10 of the Convention. They further claimed that the Court of Appeal had not balanced the various interests in any real or meaningful sense. It had not attached proper significance to the applicants' right to freedom of information and had failed to take into account that there had been no safety risks in the individual case, instead allowing the landlord to make general risk assessments. The applicants therefore claimed that there had been an interference with their rights under Article 10. This had occurred as a consequence of the Court of Appeal's application of the law and, accordingly, the State's exercise of judicial power in a civil-law dispute. Consequently, the State could not evade its responsibility in the matter.\n29. The applicants further asserted that the Court of Appeal's decision lacked a basis in law, as their satellite installation, which had not been affixed to the structure of the building, had not violated Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement and so had not breached the Land Code. Furthermore, the interference in the case had not been \u201cnecessary\u201d, as a fair balance between the competing interests had not been struck. In this connection they reiterated that their rights under Article 10 had been disregarded and that no individual safety assessment had been made. Moreover, broadcasts from certain TV channels \u2013 of particular importance to them on account of their cultural background \u2013 were available exclusively via a satellite dish. This had not been disputed in the domestic proceedings. Finally, there had been no margin of appreciation, as no vital State interests had been at issue. Instead, the reasons given by the Court of Appeal related to the landlord's interests. In sum, the interference had not been proportionate or \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n30. The Government argued that the case concerned a dispute between two private parties over a contractual obligation and that there had not been intervention by a public authority such as to bring any positive obligation of the State into play.\n31. The Court reiterates that, under Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting State \u201cshall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention\u201d. As the Court stated in Marckx v. Belgium (13 June 1979, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 31; see also Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 44), in addition to the primarily negative undertaking of a State to abstain from interference in Convention guarantees, \u201cthere may be positive obligations inherent\u201d in such guarantees. The responsibility of a State may then be engaged as a result of not observing its obligation to enact domestic legislation.\n32. The Court reiterates, further, that Article 10 applies to judicial decisions preventing a person from receiving transmissions from telecommunications satellites (see Autronic AG v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48, Series A no. 178). Moreover, the genuine and effective exercise of freedom of expression under Article 10 may require positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7\u00a7 42-46, ECHR 2000-III; Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000; and Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, \u00a7 39, ECHR 2003\u2011VI).\n33. Admittedly, the Court is not in theory required to settle disputes of a purely private nature. That being said, in exercising the European supervision incumbent on it, it cannot remain passive where a national court's interpretation of a legal act, be it a testamentary disposition, a private contract, a public document, a statutory provision or an administrative practice appears unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory or, more broadly, inconsistent with the principles underlying the Convention (see Pla and Puncernau v. Andorra, 13 July 2004, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2004-VIII).\n34. In the present case the Court notes that the Court of Appeal, in its decision of 20 December 2005, applied and interpreted not only the tenancy agreement concluded between the applicants and the landlord but also Chapter 12 of the Land Code. Further, it ruled on the applicants' right to freedom of information laid down in the Swedish Constitution and the Convention. Domestic law, as interpreted in the last resort by the Court of Appeal, therefore made lawful the treatment of which the applicants complained (see Marckx and Young, James and Webster, cited above, and VgT Verein gegen Tierfabriken v. Switzerland, 28 June 2001, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2001-VI). In effect, the applicants' eviction was the result of the court's ruling. The Court finds that the responsibility of the respondent State within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention for any resultant breach of Article 10 may be engaged on this basis.\n35. Consequently, this complaint is not incompatible ratione materiae. Nor is it manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. The Court further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n(a) Whether there was an interference with the applicants' rights under Article 10 of the Convention\n36. The responsibility of the respondent State having been established, the Court of Appeal's ruling that the applicants' tenancy agreement should be terminated because of their refusal to dismantle the satellite dish in question amounted to an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by Article 10.\n(b) Whether the interference was \u201cprescribed by law\u201d\n37. Whereas the Government claimed that the interference was prescribed by law, the applicants submitted that the Court of Appeal's decision lacked a basis in law, as their satellite installation had not been affixed to the wall and had therefore not been in breach of the tenancy agreement and the Land Code.\n38. The Court observes that the Rent Review Board and the Court of Appeal came to different conclusions as to whether the satellite installation at issue constituted an \u201coutdoor aerial\u201d in breach of Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement and the obligations under Chapter 12, section 25 of the Land Code. It is of the opinion that both interpretations were viable and that the interference can therefore be considered as having been \u201cprescribed by law\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n(c) Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim\n39. In finding against the applicants, the Court of Appeal had regard, inter alia, to the landlord's interest in upholding order and good practice. The decision could thus be said to have been aimed at the \u201cprotection of the ... rights of others\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n(d) Whether the interference was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d\n40. The Court reiterates that, as a consequence of the Court of Appeal's decision, the applicants were effectively restricted from receiving information disseminated in certain television programmes broadcast via satellite.\n41. The right to freedom to receive information basically prohibits a Government from restricting a person from receiving information that others wish or may be willing to impart to him or her (see, among other authorities, Leander v. Sweden, 26 March 1987, \u00a7 74, Series A no. 116). In a case like the present one, where the desired information was available without the broadcasters' restrictions through the use of the technical equipment at issue, the general principles of freedom of expression become applicable, as appropriate.\n42. The test of \u201cnecessity in a democratic society\u201d requires the Court to determine whether the interference complained of corresponded to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d. The Contracting States have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether such a need exists, but it goes hand in hand with European supervision, whose extent will vary according to the case. Where, as in the instant case, there has been an interference with the exercise of the rights and freedoms guaranteed in Article 10 \u00a7 1, the supervision must be strict, because of the importance of the rights in question. The necessity for restricting them must be convincingly established (see, among other authorities, Autronic AG, cited above, \u00a7 61).\n43. The Court's task in exercising its supervisory function is not to take the place of the competent domestic courts but rather to review under Article 10 the decisions they have taken pursuant to their power of appreciation (see, inter alia, Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, \u00a7 45, ECHR 1999-I). In particular, the Court must determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify the interference were \u201crelevant and sufficient\u201d and whether the measure taken was \u201cproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued\u201d. In doing so, the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities, basing themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts, applied standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (see, among other authorities, Chauvy and Others v. France, no. 64915/01, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2004\u2011VI).\n44. In the instant case the Court observes that the applicants wished to receive television programmes in Arabic and Farsi from their native country or region. That information included, for instance, political and social news that could be of particular interest to the applicants as immigrants from Iraq. Moreover, while such news might be the most important information protected by Article 10, the freedom to receive information does not extend only to reports of events of public concern, but covers in principle also cultural expressions as well as pure entertainment. The importance of the latter types of information should not be underestimated, especially for an immigrant family with three children, who may wish to maintain contact with the culture and language of their country of origin. The right at issue was therefore of particular importance to the applicants.\n45. It should be stressed that it has not been claimed that the applicants had any other means of receiving these or similar programmes at the time of the impugned decision than through the use of the satellite installation in question, nor that their satellite dish could be installed in a different location. They might have been able to obtain some news through foreign newspapers and radio programmes, but these sources of information only cover parts of what is available via television broadcasts and cannot in any way be equated with the latter. Moreover, it has not been shown that the landlord later installed broadband and internet access or other alternative means which gave the tenants in the building the possibility to receive these television programmes.\n46. It is true that a satellite dish mounted on or extending outside the fa\u00e7ade of a building may pose safety concerns, in particular since a landlord may be held responsible for damage caused by a falling dish. The Court of Appeal noted that this was the main reason for the landlord's refusal to allow the applicants' installation. However, in the instant case this aspect cannot carry much weight, as the evidence in the domestic case showed that the installation did not pose any real safety threat. It was examined by an engineer and both the Rent Review Board and the Court of Appeal inspected it before concluding that it was safe. While it might be convenient for a landlord to make general risk assessments without having to check individual installations, such considerations cannot carry much weight when set against the applicants' interests.\n47. In the domestic proceedings the landlord also referred to physical and aesthetic damage, as well as obstruction of access to the flat, as reasons for banning the satellite installation. These concerns were not directly addressed by the Court of Appeal, but it did state that the landlord had a weighty and reasonable interest in upholding order and good practice. In any event, there is no indication that these additional concerns were of any practical significance in the applicants' case. In this connection it should be mentioned that the applicants' flat was located in one of the suburbs of Stockholm, in a tenement house with no particular aesthetic aspirations.\n48. The Court further notes the Court of Appeal's finding that, while the applicants' interest in receiving the television broadcasts had to be taken into consideration, their right to freedom of information did not have such a bearing on the case that it could be considered to have any real importance. From this statement, the Court cannot but conclude that the appellate court, in weighing the interests involved, failed to apply standards in conformity with Article 10.\n49. Particular importance must also be attached to the outcome of the instant case, namely, the applicants' eviction from the flat in which they had lived for more than six years. The applicants stated that, as a result, they had to move to another city, thus incurring negative consequences of a practical, economic and social nature. The Court considers that evicting the applicants and their three children from their home was a measure which cannot be considered proportionate to the aim pursued.\n50. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, even if a certain margin of appreciation is afforded to the national authorities, the interference with the applicants' right to freedom of information was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d and that the respondent State failed in their positive obligation to protect that right. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n51. For reasons similar to those relied on under Article 10 of the Convention, the applicants complained that the eviction from their flat gave rise to a violation of their right to respect for their home under Article 8.\n52. The Government contested that argument.\n53. The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the one examined above and must therefore likewise be declared admissible.\n54. However, having regard to the finding relating to Article 10 (see paragraph 50 above), the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether, in this case, there has also been a violation of Article 8.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n55. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n56. The applicants claimed 66,000 Swedish kronor (SEK \u2013 approximately 6,500 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary damage. Their claim concerned the increased costs of the first applicant's journeys to and from work for a two-year period following their move to V\u00e4ster\u00e5s. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, they claimed SEK 50,000 (about EUR 5,000) each or other amounts which the Court considered reasonable.\n57. The Government contested the claim in respect of pecuniary damage, stating that the applicants could have avoided the additional travelling costs by accepting the landlord's offer to remain in the flat. As regards non-pecuniary damage, the Government left the matter to the Court's discretion.\n58. The Court considers that the first applicant must have sustained pecuniary damage on account of the longer journeys to and from work and finds this claim reasonable. It therefore awards it in full. Further, the Court finds it appropriate to make an award for non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards the applicants EUR 5,000 jointly under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n59. The applicants also claimed SEK 229,774 (approximately EUR 22,500) for the costs and expenses incurred after the conclusion of the domestic proceedings. This amount included SEK 216,575 (EUR 21,000) in lawyers' fees for 158 hours of work; the remainder (SEK 12,131) consisting mainly of translation expenses.\n60. The Government found the applicants' claims excessive. They maintained that reasonable compensation for costs should not exceed SEK 66,000 (EUR 6,500) exclusive of VAT. In addition, SEK 1,000 (EUR 100) was acceptable for expenses.\n61. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 10,000, inclusive of VAT, covering costs under all heads for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n62. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention;\n3. Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants jointly, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Swedish kronor at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 6,500 (six thousand five hundred euros) in respect of pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(iii) EUR 10,000 (ten thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iv) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 16 December 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President", "001-90200": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF MOESGAARD PETERSEN v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n27. The Government contested that argument and maintained that the proceedings began on 2 July 1996, when the police had carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises.\n28. The applicant was of the view that the proceedings had begun on 6 May 1994, but agreed with the Government that he had certainly been substantially affected as from 2 July 1996. The applicant also pointed out that the High Court had mistakenly found that the proceedings had begun only on 12 February 1998, which was part of the applicant\u2019s argument for bringing the case before the Supreme Court.\n29. The Court considers that the applicant was not substantially affected by the proceedings until 2 July 1996, when the police carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises. The proceedings ended on 21 June 2006, when the Leave to Appeal Board refused the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court\u2019s judgment. Thus, the criminal proceedings lasted almost ten years.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of the proceedings\n30. From a general point of view the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed with reference to the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the authorities before which the case was brought (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n##### 1. Complexity of the case\n31. The Government submitted that the criminal proceedings were extraordinarily complex as concerns the facts, law and procedural issues.\n32. The applicant disputed that the case was highly complex and emphasised, among other things, that in his case very few foreign company structures were used and almost all the banks were based in Denmark, thus a very limited part of the investigation had to be carried out abroad.\n33. The Court reiterates that the scale and complexity of a criminal case concerning fraud, which is often compounded further by the involvement of several suspects, may justify the extensive length of proceedings (see, among other authorities, C.P. and Others v. France, no. 36009/97, \u00a7 30, 1 August 2000; Hozee v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, p. 1102, \u00a7 52; Wejrup v. Denmark (dec.), no. 49126/99, ECHR 2002-IV, Petersen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 6315/02, 13 May 2004; and Frederiksen v. Denmark (dec.), 23012/02, 16 September 2004).\n34. In the present case the applicant and five co-accused were convicted of tax asset stripping of numerous private limited companies and corporate groups. The applicant and the co-accused were intricately interconnected and had collaborated in the economic crime.\n35. The applicant was found guilty on forty-four counts out of a total of fifty-nine and his responsibility related to an amount of approximately EUR 11,600,000 of the total amount of tax evaded in the case, which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000.\n36. The court records before the City Court and the High Court ran to 1,330 pages and 861 pages respectively, and the City Court judgment ran to 220 pages.\n37. The Court points out that the City Court, in its judgment of 6 April 2001, noted that the complexity of the acts carried out by the applicant and the five co-accused partly when buying and \u201cstripping\u201d the companies of assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. It found no reason to criticise the prosecution\u2019s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the five co\u2011accused and it emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against applicant and the co-accused B and R could not proceed before the cases against H, N and A had been heard.\n38. Furthermore, the Court observes that the investigation was carried out in Denmark and abroad and necessitated the issuing of numerous search warrants and discovery orders.\n39. Having regard to these circumstances, the Court finds that the investigations and the court proceedings were relevant, time-consuming and difficult. Thus, for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention the case was particularly complex.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s conduct\n40. In the Government\u2019s opinion the applicant\u2019s conduct contributed to some extent to the length of the proceedings, firstly because the crimes that he had committed rendered it necessary to carry out comprehensive and time-consuming investigations in Denmark and abroad, in addition to thorough reviews of large quantities of accounting material, secondly because the applicant\u2019s counsel was unable to appear before the High Court in the autumn of 2002, and thirdly because one of the co-defendants fell ill in the spring of 2004.\n41. The applicant disagreed and contended that his conduct had not given rise to any significant delay.\n42. It is true that the use by the applicant and the co-accused in the present case of intricate corporate structures, several of which were domiciled in or connected with foreign countries, obviously had the purpose of concealing the tax asset stripping, but this has already been taken into account in the assessment of the complexity of the case. Moreover, the Court finds that the applicant, during the criminal proceedings against him, did not act in a way that inappropriately prolonged those proceedings (see, for example, Petersen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 6315/02, 12 May 2004).\n##### 3. Conduct of the national authorities\n43. The Government found, taking into consideration the nature, scope and complexity of the case, that no criticism could be made of the time spent on the investigation, and that the proceedings before the courts were accomplished within a reasonable time and without any periods of inactivity. The only \u201cinactive\u201d period in the case occurred before the Leave to Appeal Board due to a regrettable error and lasted for approximately eight months. In the Government\u2019s view, however, that period could not be considered so grave in proceedings lasting a total of ten years in such a highly complex case that a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 should be found on that ground.\n44. The applicant contended that throughout the investigation and the court proceedings there were several periods of inactivity or almost no activity, in particular from March 1995 until June 1998; from May 2001 until September 2002; and from May 2005 until June 2006. Moreover, although not formally objecting to his case having been heard together with the co-defendants\u2019 cases, having regard to the overall period and what was at stake for him, the applicant maintained that the length of the proceedings exceeded the reasonable time requirement within Article 6 of the Convention.\n45. At the outset, the Court observes that due to the mutual connection between the cases and their character the investigations and subsequently the criminal trials of the applicant and the five co-accused were joined. The City Court found no reason to criticise this decision although admittedly it caused longer periods of inactivity during one part of the case, while investigation was going on in another part of the case. Noting that the accuseds\u2019 roles were closely interconnected and that a substantial part of the evidence procured was relevant to all of the accused, the Court can agree that the decision to join the investigations and the trials was appropriate.\n46. Moreover, the facts of the case do not disclose failure on the part of the investigating authorities or the prosecution to perform their duties with due diligence in the period from 2 July 1996, when the police carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises, until 25 June 1998 when the indictment was submitted to the City Court.\n47. Likewise, as to the proceedings before the City Court, which lasted from 25 June 1998 to 6 April 2001, thus almost two years and ten months, and those before the High Court, which lasted from 15 May 2001 to 28 September 2004, thus almost three years and five months, in the light of the complexity of the case and the unavoidable difficulties which have to be taken into consideration in a trial of that size involving six co-accused the Court finds that the length of those proceedings cannot be criticised (see, inter alia, Petersen, cited above, Frederiksen v. Denmark, (dec.), application no. 23012/02, 16 September 2004; and Wallin Karlsen v. Denmark (dec.), 23523/02), 1 February 2005).\n48. The Court cannot ignore, however, that after more than eight years of criminal proceedings, it took the Leave to Appeal Board approximately one year and eight months to decide whether the applicant and the co-defendants should be granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, and that it is not in dispute that the main reason for that was that the case lay dormant by mistake for approximately eight months from 5 August 2005 to 2 May 2006.\n##### 4. Overall assessment\n49. In the light of the above, notably the above-mentioned period of inactivity before the Leave to Appeal Board and the overall length of the proceedings, the Court concludes that the requirement of a \u201creasonable time\u201d laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not complied with in the present case. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n51. The applicant claimed DKK 100,000, equal to approximately EUR0 13,410 in compensation for the violation of his right to a fair trial within a reasonable time.\n52. Subject to the Court finding a violation, the Government agreed that generally compensation should be awarded. They found, however, that the applicant\u2019s claim was excessive and disproportionate.\n53. The Court considers that the applicant must have sustained non\u2011pecuniary damage. Having regard to its finding above, notably as to the main reason for its finding a violation, and ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him EUR 2,000.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n54. The applicant did not make any claims as regards the costs and expenses, accordingly no award is made under this head.\n#### C. Default interest\n55. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Held that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Held\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable on this amount, which is to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 11 December 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nClaudia Westerdiek Rait Maruste Registrar President", "001-57874": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF STANFORD v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 October 1993 and 25 January 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. In England and Wales, the right of an accused to be present in court at his trial is a matter of common law. The general rule was stated by Lord Reading CJ in R. v. Lee Kun (1916) 1 Kings Bench Reports 337, at 341, as follows:\n\u201cThere must be very exceptional circumstances to justify proceeding with the trial in the absence of the accused. The reason why the accused should be present at the trial is that he may hear the case made against him and have the opportunity ... of answering it. The presence of the accused means not only that he must be physically in attendance, but also that he must be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings.\u201c\n18. A trial judge may, if he considers that the accused in the dock may intimidate a witness, remove the accused from the presence of the witness, though not out of hearing (R. v. Smellie (1919) 14 Criminal Appeal Reports 128).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n19. The applicant lodged his application (no. 16757/90) with the Commission on 8 January 1990. He complained under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention that as he could not hear the proceedings which resulted in his conviction he did not receive a fair trial.\n20. On 10 February 1992 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint admissible. In its report of 21 October 1992 drawn up under Article 31 (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (eleven votes to seven). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report are reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n21. The applicant complained that he did not receive a fair trial since he was unable to hear the proceedings. He relied on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\n22. The applicant stated that as a result of not being able to hear the proceedings he was not a fully informed party to counsel\u2019s decisions on the conduct of his case and was deprived of the opportunity of checking for himself which matters of evidence were consistent or inconsistent with the written statements against him. By complaining to the prison officer who was guarding him in the dock, as well as to his lawyers, he had done all that could have been expected of him to notify the court. He maintained that he did not agree with the decision of his lawyers not to make a representation to the trial judge.\nHe further submitted that the responsibility of the respondent Government was engaged since it was the poor acoustics of the courtroom which were the primary cause of his difficulties in hearing the proceedings. This was borne out by the decision to instal a reflector panel above the dock to increase audibility (see paragraph 16 above).\n23. The Government, on the other hand, pointed out that the acoustics of the courtroom were tested both before the court was opened and in 1990, subsequent to the applicant\u2019s complaint. On both occasions they were found to be satisfactory.\nIn their view, as well as that of the Commission, the responsibility of the Government was not otherwise engaged since neither the applicant nor his lawyers complained or made any representation to the court about the applicant\u2019s hearing difficulties. Moreover, this was a deliberate and tactical decision by counsel with which the applicant could be taken to have agreed. Nothing therefore occurred during the course of the trial which would have put the judge on notice of this problem.\n24. The Court must consider the proceedings as a whole including the decisions of the appellate courts. Its task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety, as well as the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, inter alia, the Edwards v. the United Kingdom judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247-B, pp. 34-35, para. 34).\n25. It recalls that it is not in dispute between those appearing before the Court that the applicant had difficulties in hearing some of the evidence given during the trial.\n26. Nor is it in dispute that Article 6 (art. 6), read as a whole, guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial. In general this includes, inter alia, not only his right to be present, but also to hear and follow the proceedings. Such rights are implicit in the very notion of an adversarial procedure and can also be derived from the guarantees contained in sub-paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c, art. 6-3-d, art. 6-3-e), - \u201cto defend himself in person\u201c, \u201cto examine or have examined witnesses\u201c, and \u201cto have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court\u201c (see, inter alia, the Colozza v. Italy judgment of 12 February 1985, Series A no. 89, p. 14, para. 27, and the Barber\u00e0, Messegu\u00e9 and Jabardo v. Spain judgment of 6 December 1988, Series A no. 146, p. 33, para. 78).\n27. In the present case neither the applicant nor the legal representatives sought to bring his hearing difficulties to the attention of the trial judge at any stage throughout the six-day hearing. It is true that the applicant mentioned these problems to a prison officer and subsequently to his lawyers (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). However, the officer was neither a court official nor an officer of the court. Moreover, counsel, who had lengthy experience in handling criminal cases, chose for tactical reasons to remain silent about the difficulties (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) and there was nothing to indicate that, as subsequently claimed, the applicant disagreed with this decision.\n28. The State cannot normally be held responsible for the actions or decisions of an accused\u2019s lawyer. It follows from the independence of the legal profession that the conduct of the defence is essentially a matter between the defendant and his representatives. The Contracting States are required to intervene only if a failure by counsel to provide effective representation is manifest or sufficiently brought to their attention (see, as the most recent authority, mutatis mutandis, the Imbrioscia v. Switzerland judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, p. 14, para. 41).\nThis was not, however, the position in the present case (see paragraph 27 above).\n29. The applicant further maintained that the Government bore responsibility for the poor acoustics of the courtroom. While this is undoubtedly a matter which could give rise to an issue under Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, the expert reports which were carried out both before and after the applicant\u2019s complaint indicated that, apart from a minimal loss of sound due to the glass screen, the acoustic levels in the courtroom were satisfactory (see paragraph 16 above).\n30. Finally it must be recalled that the applicant was represented by a solicitor and counsel who had no difficulty in following the proceedings and who would have had every opportunity to discuss with the applicant any points that arose out of the evidence which did not already appear in the witness statements. Moreover a reading of the transcript of the trial reveals that he was ably defended by his counsel and that the trial judge\u2019s summing up to the jury fairly and thoroughly reflected the evidence presented to the court.\n31. In addition, the Court of Appeal, which had been seised of the matter (see paragraph 14 above), could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to correct an alleged shortcoming in the trial proceedings which had not been raised before the trial judge (see, in this respect, the above-mentioned Edwards judgment, Series A no. 247-B, p. 35, para. 39, and the authorities cited therein).\n32. In light of the above the Court concludes that there had been no failure by the United Kingdom to ensure that the applicant received a fair trial. There has thus been no breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 6 (art. 6).\nDone in English and in French and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 February 1994.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 EISSEN\nRegistrar", "001-86343": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF TWIZELL v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n7. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007.\n8. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) introduced various new social-security payments, inter alia, Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance.\n9. Bereavement Payment is payable both to men and women in place of Widow\u2019s Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001. However, the amount is double the sum offered under the previous scheme. Bereavement Allowance replaced Widow\u2019s Pension. It is an allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the time of the spouse\u2019s death and where there are no dependent children. It is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\n11. He further complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefits to which he would have been entitled had his wife died after April 2001, namely Bereavement Payment (\u201cBP\u201d) and Bereavement Allowance (\u201cBA\u201d) constituted discrimination against him contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n12. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n13. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n14. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to Wpt, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n15. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n16. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to Wpt, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Pension\n##### 1. Admissibility\n17. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41). The Court, consequently, considering that it was not necessary to examine the complaint separately under Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n18. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### C. Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n19. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint about the non\u2011payment to him of BP and BA falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.) [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7\u00a7 53 and 54, ECHR 2005- ...). Since Article 14 therefore applies, it is not necessary to decide whether the complaint also raises an issue under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see also Willis v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n20. The Court recalls that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 does not include a right to acquire property. It places no restriction on the Contracting State\u2019s freedom to decide whether or not to have in place any form of social security scheme, or to choose the type or amount of benefits to provide under any such scheme. If, however, a State does decide to create a benefits or pension scheme, it must do so in a manner which is compatible with Article 14 of the Convention (see the Stec and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 54\u201155).\n21. A difference of treatment is discriminatory if it has no objective and reasonable justification; in other words, if it does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting State enjoys a margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment (see the Stec and Others, [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, \u00a7 51, ECHR 2006-...). The scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and the background.\n22. The Court notes that unlike most complaints relating to these issues, the present complaint is not about a difference in treatment based exclusively on the ground of sex, in which case very weighty reasons would have to be put forward to find such a difference in treatment compatible with the Convention. The present complaint is based on the fact that a difference in treatment resulted from the application of a cut-off date.\n23. In the present case, it must be recalled that the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) introduced a new system of benefits, the aim of which was to level out any discrimination arising from the previous system of benefits applied in the United Kingdom before April 2001. In particular, the 1999 Act introduced, among other benefits, BP and BA and came into force on 9 April 2001. It replaced equivalent benefits payable prior to that date, but to which only widows had been entitled.\n24. The Court considers that BP and BA were intended to correct the undesired discriminatory situation created amongst the widowed part of the population prior to 2001 and therefore the resultant difference in treatment caused by the non-retrospective effect of the operative date \u2013 9 April 2001 \u2013 pursued a legitimate aim. In creating a scheme of benefits it is sometimes necessary to use cut-off points that apply to large groups of people and which may to a certain extent appear arbitrary. The applicant\u2019s spouse died almost immediately before the entry into force of the 1999 Act and for that reason the applicant could not qualify for BP and BA. However, this is an inevitable consequence of introducing new systems which replace previous and outdated schemes. The choice of a cut-off date when transforming social security regimes must be considered as falling within the wide margin of appreciation afforded to a State when reforming its social strategy policy and in the instant case the impugned cut-off date can be deemed reasonably and objectively justified.\n25. It follows that the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary damage\n27. In respect of pecuniary damage the applicant claimed a total of 10,770 British pounds sterling (GBP):\n(i) GBP 2,000 for Widow\u2019s Payment/Bereavement Payment;\n(ii) GBP 3,770 for BA (52 weeks at GBP 72.50 per week).\n28. The Government requested the Court to limit any award to the sum of GBP 1,142.97 representing Wpt and interest as of November 2005.\n29. The Court notes that it has only found a violation in respect of Wpt. It recalls that at the time of the applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s death, the lump sum for Wpt was equivalent to GBP 1,000. The interest rate has already been determined by the Court in the case of Runkee and White (cited above, \u00a7 52). Thus, making an award on an equitable basis, the Court awards compensation to the applicant of 1,960 euros (EUR) in respect of the refusal to grant him Wpt including interest.\n#### B. Non-pecuniary damage\n30. The applicant claimed GBP 5,000 for the hurt and distress caused by the alleged violation.\n31. The Government contested the claim.\n32. The Court does not find it established that the applicant was caused real and serious emotional damage as a result of being denied the benefit in question. No award can accordingly be made under this head.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n33. The applicant did not submit any claims under this head.\n#### D. Default interest\n34. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to declare admissible the complaint relating to the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaints under Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,960 (one thousand nine hundred and sixty euros) in respect of pecuniary damage;\n(ii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amount;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 May 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-105434": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SUFI AND ELMI v.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 June 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At the material time, following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, an applicant had a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cthe AIT\u201d). Section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as inserted by section 81(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004) provided that a party to an appeal to the AIT could apply for an order that the AIT reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law.\n28. Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted, an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) stated that:\n\u201cWhen a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\n29. Where a person was not granted leave to enter the United Kingdom, he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State also had power to deport any person who was not a British citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d.\n### III. RELEVANT EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n30. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (\u201cthe Qualification Directive\u201d) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n31. On 17 October 2007 the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) asking, inter alia, whether article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.\n32. The ECJ held that article 15(c) protection went beyond that of Article 3 of the Convention, which was covered by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive. The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows:\n\u201cArticle 15(c) of the Directive, in conjunction with article 2(e) of the Directive, must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country or as the case may be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.\u201d\n33. In QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 620 the Court of Appeal observed that the ECJ in Elgafaji had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality, but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article 15(c). A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article 15(c) where the level of violence was such that, without anything to render them a particular target, civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety.\n34. More recently, in the case of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat, whether permissible under the laws or not, that seriously endangered non-combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive.\n### IV. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n35. It is a well-established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country. This principle is reflected both in article 8 of the Qualification Directive and paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay.\n36. In the cases of Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords held that the decision-maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so. In this regard, the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality, including in his former place of habitual residence. If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation, judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally, and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there. However, the more closely the persecution was linked to the State, and the greater the control of the State over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf, the more likely (other things being equal) that a victim of persecution in one place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same State.\n### V. RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMALIA\n#### A. Factual background\n37. The factual background to the conflict in Somalia, as described in the country reports at paragraphs 80 \u2013 188 below and subsequently agreed by the parties, is as follows.\n38. Somalia is comprised of three autonomous areas: the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the north west, the state of Puntland in the north east, and the remaining southern and central regions. Somali society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families, which are subdivided into clans and sub-clans. The four majority clans are Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq and Dir. In addition there are a number of minority groups, which are also divided into sub-groups. The Digli and Mirifle take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups.\n39. Somalia has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President Siad Barre by opposing clans in 1991. The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness, civil conflict and clan warfare followed. Mogadishu was fragmented into rival, clan-based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords. The Transitional Federal Government was established in October 2004 but a combination of internal divisions within the Transitional Federal Government and insecurity in central and southern Somalia hindered it from becoming a functioning Government. In June 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts, a union of various Sharia courts, took control of Mogadishu. Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of most of central and southern Somalia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 (2006) authorised the deployment of an African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development force to protect the Transitional Federal Government. Ethiopian ground and air forces also moved into Somalia to support the Transitional Federal Government and by late December 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts had been ousted from Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. Remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops.\n40. After the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts, the semblance of order and security that it had created in Mogadishu deteriorated. Roadblocks and checkpoints returned, as did banditry and violence. Furthermore, attacks by anti-government elements on Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces continued in Mogadishu, with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting. Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced. The fall of the Union of Islamic Courts also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra-clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued.\n41. In 2007 the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia was created when Somali Islamists and opposition leaders joined forces to fight the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces.\n42. On 20 August 2008 the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia signed a ceasefire agreement in Djibouti. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, the Islamic insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement, and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia.\n43. By late 2008 Islamist insurgents, including a group called al\u2011Shabaab, had regained control of most of southern Somalia.\n44. Somalia\u2019s Parliament met in Djibouti in January 2009 and swore in 149 new members from the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. The Parliament also extended the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government for another two years and installed moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as the new President.\n45. Ethiopia pulled its troops out of Somalia in January 2009. Soon after, al-Shabaab took control of Baidoa, formerly a key stronghold of the Transitional Federal Government. In May 2009 Islamist insurgents launched an attack on Mogadishu, prompting President Ahmad to appeal for help from abroad.\n46. In October 2009 al-Shabaab consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival, Hizbul Islam, out of the southern port city of Kismayo. Since then it has openly declared its alliance with al-Qaeda and has been steadily moving forces up towards Mogadishu.\n47. In December 2010 Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab merged.\n#### B. Parties to the conflict\n##### 1. The Transitional Federal Government\n48. The Transitional Federal Government is recognised by the United Nations and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of Somalia. However, it currently controls only a small section of Mogadishu centred on the port, the airport and the presidential palace. It is largely dependent on African Union troops for its survival.\n##### 2. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\n49. AMISOM is an African Union force authorised by the UN Security Council and deployed to Mogadishu to support the Transitional Federal Government. It currently consists of 5,300 Ugandan and Burundian troops.\n##### 3. Ethiopian forces\n50. Ethiopian forces joined the conflict in 2006 to help drive out the Union of Islamic Courts. They remained in Somalia until their withdrawal at the beginning of 2009.\n##### 4. Al-Shabaab\n51. Al-Shabaab began as part of the armed wing of the Union of Islamic Courts. When the 2006 Ethiopian military intervention sent the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts into exile, a hard core of al-Shabaab fighters remained in Somalia to fight. In their April 2010 report, \u201cHarsh War, Harsh Peace\u201d, Human Rights Watch indicated that al-Shabaab was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity, but the group\u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda: defeating AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government and extending Sharia law across Somalia. Some of its leaders have links with al-Qaeda although the extent of al-Qaeda\u2019s influence over al-Shabaab remains unclear.\n52. Al-Shabaab has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground, especially in southern Somalia. They have received material support from the Eritrean government, which is eager to undercut Ethiopia\u2019s interests in the region. By the end of 2009 al-Shabaab controlled more territory than any other faction in Somalia, including Baidoa, the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament, Jowhar, which had been one of the Transitional Federal Government President\u2019s most reliable strongholds, and the strategic port of Kismayo.\n53. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala on 11 July 2010, which killed 79 people watching the World Cup soccer final on television. It was al-Shabaab\u2019s first attack outside Somalia and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond.\n##### 5. Hizbul Islam\n54. Hizbul Islam is another armed group which has both a Sharia agenda and the goal of driving AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government from Mogadishu. In early 2009 it entered into an alliance with al-Shabaab but the alliance came to an end in October 2009 during the fight for Kismayo. In December 2010, however, it once again merged with al\u2011Shabaab.\n##### 6. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca\n55. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca is an Islamist group which professes to support a more moderate agenda. The group exists primarily in central Somalia, where it has maintained control over large strips of territory, predominantly in Galgadud and Hiran regions.\n56. In February 2010 Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca signed a power-sharing and military unification pact with the Transitional Federal Government, although at times relations between the two groups were strained.\n### VI. RELEVANT CASE LAW\n#### A. NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076\n57. In NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076 the AIT found that conditions in southern Somalia and particularly in and around Mogadishu were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of Article 3 ill-treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them. Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection, although individual circumstances required separate consideration. Although women were at greater risk than men, they would not be able to show that, simply as lone female returnees from the United Kingdom, they had no place of clan safety. Finally, the AIT held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in Somalia did not engage the obligations of the Refugee Convention or engage Article 3 of the Convention for all female returnees. A differential impact had to be shown. Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator.\n58. The AIT observed in passing that, on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing, it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an IDP camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under Article 3, if not under the Refugee Convention.\n#### B. HH and Others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022\n59. In HH and others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that for the purposes of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a situation of internal armed conflict existed in Mogadishu. The AIT held, however, that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians, they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and, as a consequence, a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area.\n60. The AIT found that although clan support networks were strained, they had not yet collapsed. Majority clans continued to have arms, even though their militias no longer controlled the city. A person from a majority clan, or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with, or acceptance by, a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance, including at times of displacement. A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at real risk of serious harm of being targeted by criminal elements, both in any area of former residence and in the likely event of being displaced. Members of minority groups found it harder to flee and move around to escape fighting, because they were not so easily accepted in new surroundings. The AIT found that persons displaced from their home in Mogadishu without being able to find a place elsewhere with clan members or friends would likely have to spend a significant period of time in a makeshift shelter, such as those along the road to Afgooye, or in an IDP camp, and could well experience treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention.\n61. Finally, the AIT held that the issue of whether a person from a minority clan would be able to find majority clan support would often need specific and detailed consideration. The evidence suggested that certain minority groups could be accepted by the majority clan of the area in question, so as to call on protection from that clan. On the current evidence, it might not be appropriate to assume that a finding of minority group status in southern Somalia was in itself sufficient to entitle a person to international protection, particularly where a person\u2019s credibility was otherwise lacking.\n#### C. AM and AM (armed conflict: risk categories) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00091\n62. In its most recent Somali Country Guidance determination, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal found that since its decision in HH there had been a number of significant changes in Somalia.\n63. First, the AIT found that by mid-2008 the armed conflict had spread beyond Mogadishu and its environs. The AIT therefore found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout central and southern Somalia. In respect of the intensity of the violence, the AIT noted that \u201cmanifestly all significant armed parties to the conflict have engaged in indiscriminate attacks\u201d. In particular, it noted that the Ethiopians were reported to have used means of war (firing inherently indiscriminate Katyusha rockets in urban areas) and methods of warfare (using mortars and indirect weapons without guidance in urban areas) that violated International Humanitarian Law. The TGF were reported to have engaged in aggression against civilians and to have acted \u201cas if they believe that they are immune from accountability, investigation or prosecution, including for crimes under international law\u201d. Moreover, reports indicated that insurgents had perpetrated raids, robberies and other abuses against civilians, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. The AIT referred to information received from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (\u201cIASC\u201d) which expressed concerns about:\n\u201cindiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas; indiscriminate use of roadside bombs and mortars from and in civilian areas; indiscriminate shooting in response to roadside bombs; arbitrary arrest and detention of civilians, including children; forced evictions; forced recruitment, including of children; sexual and gender based violence; intimidation and assassination of journalists, aid workers and civilian officials; and extra-judicial killings.\u201d\n64. The AIT also noted that the worsening security situation was coupled with a deteriorating humanitarian situation. It observed that between 400,000 and 750,000 people had been displaced from Mogadishu and that there had been significant displacements from other towns to which armed clashes had spread. The AIT also observed first, that IDPs experienced serious problems while on the move, which included checkpoints, threats, intimidation, looting, rape, abduction and harassment; secondly, that many did not end up in camps or makeshift settlements and consequently struggled to obtain shelter, food, water and sanitation; and thirdly, that the effect of displacement appeared to reduce the ability of IDPs to count on protection from their own clan: even where they fled to a traditional area for their clan, the pressures of numbers and scarce resources could mean that newcomers were not supported or absorbed by the local community.\n65. With regard to the situation in Mogadishu, the AIT considered that:\n\u201cthe movements of population out of Mogadishu in the past two years have been unprecedented. UN sources have estimated (at various times) that 400,000, up to as many as 750,000 (or around one third to a half), of the population of Mogadishu have been displaced. An 8 April 2008 Voice of America report states that two thirds of Mogadishu has been turned into an urban battleground. Since the beginning of 2008 there have been significantly fewer returns. Whatever the precise figures, it is clear that the ongoing violence has forced substantial numbers to flee the city more than once and flight seems an ongoing process: the IRIN report of 29 September 2008 cites Elman estimates that 18,500 people recently fled their homes due to the fighting and shelling (COIS, A 4). The COIS Reply dated 24 October 2008 states that: \u201c[a]ccording to the UNHCR an estimated 5,500 people were displaced from the city during the week and over 61,000 since 21 September 2008\u201d. Armed clashes have increasingly destroyed housing, market areas (Bakara market has been deliberately shelled) and infrastructure and the recent closure of the airport is likely to make matters in Mogadishu worse. According to Grayson and Munk, the aid community has been largely ineffective in providing the necessary aid to those who have stayed in Mogadishu (Nairobi evidence 65). They also state that Mogadishu is a \u201cghost town\u201d and that only the most vulnerable remain there.\u201d\n66. It concluded that since HH the situation in Mogadishu had changed significantly, both in terms of the extent of population displacement away from the city, the intensity of the fighting and the security conditions there. On the available evidence the AIT considered that Mogadishu was no longer safe as a place to live for the great majority of its citizens. It did not rule out that there might be certain individuals who on the facts might be considered to be able to live safely in the city, for example if they had close connections with powerful actors in Mogadishu, such as prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs. However, barring cases of this kind, in the case of persons found to come from Mogadishu who were returnees from the United Kingdom, the AIT found that they would face on return a real risk of persecution or serious harm and it was reasonably likely, if they tried staying there, that they would soon be forced to leave or that they would decide not to try to live there in the first place.\n67. Nevertheless, the AIT were not persuaded that the situation in central and southern Somalia had reached the threshold where civilians per se or Somali civilian IDPs per se could be said to face a real risk of persecution, serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention. First, although the levels of violence had increased in intensity, the numbers of those killed and wounded was not of great magnitude. Secondly, while the humanitarian situation was dire, it did not appear that civilians per se faced a real risk of denial of basic food and shelter and other bare necessities of life. Thirdly, while there was evidence of attacks on IDPs, in view of the huge numbers of people displaced (over a million according to some reports), it appeared that the great majority of IDPs were able to travel and subsist in IDP camps or settlements without serious setbacks.\n68. Rather, the AIT assessment of the extent to which IDPs would face greater or lesser hardships, at least outside Mogadishu, would vary depending on a number of factors. In particular, the AIT noted that IDPs from more influential clans appeared to have a better chance of being tolerated in the area to which they fled; IDPs with a traditional clan area that they could travel to, especially if they had close relatives or close clan affiliations in that area, appeared to have better prospects of finding safety and support (although not if the area concerned was already saturated with fellow IDPs); those who lacked recent experience of living in Somalia appeared more likely to have difficulty dealing with the changed environment in which clan loyalties had to some extent fractured; persons returning to their home area from the United Kingdom could be perceived as having relative wealth and might be more susceptible to extortion, abduction and the like; those who lived in areas not particularly affected by the fighting and which were not seen as strategically important to any of the main parties to the conflict would appear less subject to security problems; women and girls faced the additional risks of rape, abduction and harassment; the prevailing economic conditions in the area would also be relevant, bearing in mind Somalia\u2019s history of droughts, poor harvests and rising food prices.\n69. The AIT recognised that there had been a significant change in the clan-based character of Somali society since HH was promulgated. Clan protection was not as effective as it had been in the early 1990s and conflicts over scarce resources had complicated the situation and made it unpredictable. This did not mean, however, that the clan or sub-clan had ceased to be the primary entity to which individuals turned for protection.\n70. As regards internal relocation, whether those whose home area was Mogadishu (or indeed any other part of central and southern Somalia) would be able to relocate in safety and without undue hardship would depend on the evidence as to the general circumstances in the relevant parts of central and southern Somalia and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Whether or not it was likely that relocation would mean that they had to live in an IDP camp would be an important but not necessarily a decisive factor.\n71. The AIT considered the safety of en route travel from Mogadishu International Airport, which was the point of return for anyone being removed to central and southern Somalia. The AIT noted that:\n\u201cThe airport is one of the facilities patrolled by AMISON troops (COIS, 27.13). According to Somalia Humanitarian Overview, September 2008, normally at least 5 commercial flights arrive and depart on a weekly basis to and from the rest of Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Dubai. The COIS Reply of 24 October 2008 notes that it is expected in the next month or so that thousands will leave via MIA to perform Haj in Saudi Arabia. At the time of HH, the airport was fully operational with flights arriving and departing regularly. However in 2008 the situation has been unsettled. There were attacks of some kind in January 2008 and the downing of a plane by a missile in March 2008 (COIS, 27.13). The airport was attacked by insurgents on 1 June 2008 as the President\u2019s plane left for talks in Djibouti. On 14 September 2008 a group identifying themselves as Al Shabab threatened to shut the airport down, although a counter-report from Union of Islamic Courts said that the Islamist forces did not intend to close it. It was closed on 16 September. On 28 September there were mortar attacks on it upon the arrival of an AMISON military plane (COIS, A.2). A Press TV cutting dated 2 October 2008 states that 5 heavy mortars landed inside MIA injuring a number of soldiers. The assailants apparently targeted a plane trying to land. A COIS Reply dated 15 October 2008 reports an Al Shabab source as saying that on 9 October a civilian plane carrying 120 Somali deportees from Saudi Arabia managed to land without incident. A 13 October press report refers to several mortar attacks on the airport. We were told by the respondent at the outset of the hearing that removals to Somalia were temporarily suspended because of travel documentation problems, but it may well be, in the light of these recent developments, that for the immediate future at least, there would be difficulties in ensuring safe arrival in any event.\u201d\n72. In HH the AIT had concluded that those moving around Mogadishu and the environs would in general not be at risk of serious harm at checkpoints, although it left open the possibility that the situation might be different if a person were likely to encounter a non-Transitional Federal Government checkpoint alone, without friends, family or other clan members. However, in AM the AIT noted that from the second half of 2007 United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimate of the number of roadblocks/checkpoints in central and southern Somalia showed an increase from 238 in July 2007 to 400 in July 2008 and considerably more than half were under the control of insurgents. Nevertheless, while the AIT found that the Transitional Federal Government appeared by and large to have lost control of many of the roadblocks and checkpoints in central and southern Somalia, the evidence continued to indicate that they retained control of the main road from the airport into Mogadishu. While there was some evidence that the road came under attack from insurgents on a daily basis, there was clearly a great deal of ongoing movement of people along the roads in central and southern Somalia and in and around the airport and the AIT did not consider that the available evidence demonstrated a real risk en route of persecution or serious harm for travellers from the airport to Mogadishu.\n#### D. HH (Somalia), AM (Somalia), J (Somalia) and MA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426\n73. One of the applicants in HH and one of the applicants in AM were granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Their appeals were joined to those of two other Somali applicants.\n74. HH contended that the AIT had erred in its application of the provisions of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive as it had held first, that the notion of an \u201cindividual threat\u201d required a \u201cdifferential impact \u201d and secondly, that article 15(c) did not add anything to Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. Before the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State for the Home Department accepted that the AIT had erred in its interpretation of article 15(c), but submitted that the error was not material. The Court of Appeal held that if the correct (post-Elgafaji) approach to article 15(c) had been applied to the facts found by the AIT, it was inevitable that it would have found that the population of Mogadishu as a whole was not subject to such a high level of indiscriminate violence as to justify the conclusion that merely to be there attracted entitlement to subsidiary protection. Consequently, the Court of Appeal dismissed HH\u2019s appeal on the ground that the error of law was not material.\n75. The AIT had accepted that AM was from Jowhar. It noted that there was no longer any significant fighting there but accepted that there was evidence that en route travel to Jowhar was hazardous. Nevertheless, the AIT held that it was not empowered to consider the risk faced in making the journey: rather, it was for the Secretary of State for the Home Department, in finalising the removal arrangements, to satisfy herself that there would be safe en route travel for AM. AM appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that this was not a lawful approach. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that in any case in which it could be shown either directly or by implication what route and method of return was envisaged, the AIT was required by law to consider and determine any challenge to the safety of that route or method. The AIT therefore fell into error as it had declined to consider AM\u2019s safety on return. The Court of Appeal remitted the case to the AIT to consider this issue.\n76. J had sought judicial review of the Secretary of State for the Home Department\u2019s refusal to accept as a fresh claim her submissions about the situation facing her were she to be returned to Somalia. The Administrative Court had held that if the removal directions had indicated that J was expected to go by road from Mogadishu International Airport to her home town, the evidence would have given her a strongly arguable case for judicial review. However, as the detail or method of return was neither clearly nor necessarily implicit within the immigration decision, the judicial review application had been refused. J appealed to the Court of Appeal. For the same reasons adopted in AM\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. The Court of Appeal indicated (on an obiter basis) that the Qualification Directive and the Asylum Procedures Directive read together required that the issues of safety during return (as opposed to technical obstacles during return) should be considered as part of the decision on entitlement. Only technical obstacles could legitimately be deferred to the point at which removal directions were being made or considered. If there was a real issue of safety on return the Secretary of State had to engage with it in his decision on entitlement to protection. If he failed to do so, the appeal tribunal would have to deal with the issue. In any case, the decision on entitlement had to be made within a reasonable time and could not be left until the Secretary of State was in a position to set safe removal directions.\n77. MA appealed against the rejection of his Article 3 claims by the AIT. In particular, he complained that the AIT had misdirected itself because it had focused on his failure to tell the truth when it should have asked whether there was evidence relating to his own particular situation, even ignoring his own rejected testimony, which would support his contention that there was a real risk on return. The Court of Appeal accepted that the AIT had adopted the wrong approach, apparently considering that the applicant\u2019s lies had disabled it from reaching a conclusion on the Article 3 risk. Had it made an assessment on the basis of the available evidence, it would have had to have concluded that the applicant was at risk of Article 3 ill-treatment on return. The Court of Appeal noted that following AM, the Country Guidance relating to Mogadishu was such that most potential returnees would be entitled to subsidiary protection under article 15 of the Qualification Directive. It therefore followed that only those Somalis who could get without undue risk to a place of safety or who had access to protection against the endemic dangers could properly be deported or returned. It was accepted that MA was from a minority clan, that he had not been in Somalia for 15 years, and that for much of that time he had been in detention. There was therefore sufficient evidence before the AIT to at least establish a real risk that he would not have the necessary contacts in Mogadishu to afford him the necessary protection.\n#### E. AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC)\n78. In AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that the First Tier Tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the applicant could safely reach his home area of Afgooye from Mogadishu International Airport. However, on reconsideration the Tribunal was not satisfied that returning him would give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In particular, it found that travel took place with some degree of frequency from the airport to the city of Mogadishu and into other areas of Somalia; that as the applicant had lived in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, he would be well able to anticipate and comply with the requirements of al-Shabaab; that there was nothing which would put him at any risk were he to encounter a Transitional Federal Government checkpoint; that the evidence did not support a finding that all men or young men were at risk of forced recruitment by al-Shabaab; and, that as the applicant was not found to be a minority clan member, and as his uncle had been able to fund his departure from Somalia, he would be able to avoid foreseeable risks and pay the relatively modest sums demanded at checkpoints.\n#### F. Judgment of 24 February 2011 (UM 10061-09) of the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal (Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen)\n79. The Swedish Migration Court of Appeal, which is the court of final instance in immigration cases, found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout the whole of southern and central Somalia which was sufficiently serious to expose the Somali applicant to a risk of serious harm, even though he could not demonstrate that he would be specifically targeted. The court had regard to many reports which indicated that the fighting had increased in recent months and that the situation had become very unstable and unpredictable. Moreover, due to the worsening security situation, the presence of the United Nations and other international organisations had decreased and, as a consequence, detailed and updated information was hard to come by. Although the safety level in Somaliland and Puntland was considered to be acceptable, a Somali returnee could only gain admittance to those areas if he was seen as belonging or having another connection to them. As that was not the case with the applicant, the court concluded that he could not internally relocate and that he should thus be given a residence permit and subsidiary protection in Sweden.\n### VII. RELEVANT COUNTRY INFORMATION\n#### A. United Kingdom Government Reports\n##### 1. Somalia: Report of Fact-Finding Mission to Nairobi,\n8 \u2013 15 September 2010\n80. The fact-finding mission interviewed a number of anonymous sources, including international NGOs, security advisors and diplomatic sources, about the current security and humanitarian situation in southern and central Somalia. In particular, the mission sought to obtain information on which groups controlled which areas, how easy it was to travel between different areas, the security and human rights situation, and the conditions in the IDP camps.\n81. Sources indicated that control of Mogadishu was divided between the Transitional Federal Government, backed by AMISOM troops, and\nal-Shabaab. Although the sources had different views on which groups controlled which districts, they mostly agreed that the Transitional Federal Government controlled the airport, the seaport, Villa Somalia and the road between the airport and Villa Somalia.\n82. Sources indicated that the security situation in Mogadishu was poor, with thousands of civilians killed in the fighting between AMISOM and\nal-Shabaab. Areas controlled by al-Shabaab were at risk of shelling by AMISOM, while areas controlled by AMISOM were at risk of shelling by al-Shabaab. All parties to the conflict were guilty of indiscriminate shelling. Violence was sporadic and rape was an issue in many areas. Consequently, there was a constant movement of IDPs into and out of the city. However, one diplomatic source suggested that it would be possible to live in\nnon-conflict areas of the city, which were generally considered to be safe.\n83. Sources also indicated that the nature of al-Shabaab violence had become more sophisticated over the past twelve months as foreign fighters had brought with them new tactics and techniques. They not only carried out targeted attacks against AMISOM troops and Transitional Federal Government ministers and MPs, but they also carried out random killings of civilians in Mogadishu in order to create disorder and chaos.\n84. The report noted that there were regular flights into Somalia, most of which were destined for Mogadishu International Airport. The EU Special Representative informed the Mission that 15-18 flights arrived in Mogadishu each day. An airplane captain working for African Express Airways also told the Mission that his airline had carried 12,000 passengers into Mogadishu in the first eight months of 2010.\n85. The road between the airport and Mogadishu was controlled by the Transitional Federal Government with AMISOM support and these groups managed all checkpoints along the route. It would not be particularly dangerous for ordinary Somalis unless they found themselves \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. However, there were reports of a failed attack on the airport on 9 September 2010 and some sources suggested that contacts were required in order to make the journey from the airport. The EU Special Representative for the EU Delegation on Somalia indicated that those members of the diaspora who regularly travelled to Mogadishu were\nwell-connected and that mobility was limited unless the individual was aligned with a militia. Likewise, a representative from an international NGO indicated that \u201cany Somalis returning to Mogadishu International Airport would need a lot of preparation and would need to ensure they had contacts in Mogadishu\u201d.\n86. A representative from one international NGO suggested that al-Shabaab knew who was landing at the airport as they were receiving information from Transitional Federal Government soldiers based there.\n87. Most of the sources interviewed agreed that Somalis were able to move around within Mogadishu without much restriction. Two sources described the checkpoints in the city as \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cvariable\u201d as they tended to change according to fighting areas and the level of control of specific groups. One source suggested that checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government or Hizbul Islam were more difficult to negotiate as they were operated with less discipline and normally demanded money. Al-Shabaab checkpoints normally checked that people were obeying their code of behaviour and would therefore stop women travelling alone. Some individuals operating these checkpoints would punish those who were not acting according to al-Shabaab\u2019s rules.\n88. Contrary to the majority opinion, the EU Special Representative informed the fact-finding mission that all civilians in Mogadishu would either be aligned to a militia or completely unable to get out of the town. The Special Representative even suggested that some Somalis were unable to leave their own district.\n89. There was no consensus on which groups controlled the other regions in southern and central Somalia, although all agreed that al-Shabaab controlled most of the land south of a line drawn between Beletweyne and Dhusarmareb. Militias broadly aligned with the Transitional Federal Government controlled pockets of land on the Ethiopian border. Hizbul Islam was nominally in control of some small areas, including parts of the Afgooye Corridor, but al-Shabaab\u2019s influence in these areas was significant. Finally, the region of Galmudug was controlled by a local clan-based administration which acted under the umbrella of Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca.\n90. Outside Mogadishu, people were generally permitted to travel within the areas controlled by al-Shabaab although they could encounter difficulties at checkpoints if they were not obeying al-Shabaab rules. Although al-Shabaab had endeavoured to remove \u201cillegal\u201d checkpoints, a number of sources indicated that some clan militia checkpoints remained. The evidence appeared to suggest that it was possible to negotiate the various checkpoints, although a certain amount of risk was involved.\n91. A diplomatic source stated that young men travelling in al-Shabaab held areas could be targeted by al-Shabaab for recruitment. This was supported by an international NGO, which advised that forced recruitment was becoming systematic. Young men were asked to register with\nal-Shabaab, including those who were stopped at checkpoints.\n92. A number of sources considered the areas controlled by al-Shabaab to be stable and generally safe for those Somalis who were able to \u201cplay the game\u201d and avoid the unnecessary attention of al-Shabaab. One the other hand, one international NGO believed that there were \u201cno safe areas in southern-central Somalia as long as al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam were present\u201d. Another NGO indicated that everywhere in southern and central Somalia had been affected by violations of international humanitarian law and by a situation of generalised violence and displacement over the past three years on account of the expansion of the insurgency outside Mogadishu. Finally, a diplomatic source stated that \u201ceverywhere is volatile and can change at any time\u201d.\n93. With regard to the human rights situation, forced recruitment of adults and children appeared to be an emerging problem, particularly for those displaced in the Afgooye Corridor. Sources suggested that all parties to the conflict recruited children, although it was not certain that the Transitional Federal Government forcibly recruited them. Child recruitment was, however, very common in al-Shabaab areas, as they would forcibly recruit the eldest son from local families, some of whom were as young as ten years old. Adult males were also forced to register with al-Shabaab in Merca and Doble.\n94. Moreover, the sources indicated that in al-Shabaab areas, human rights were practically non-existent because of the organisation\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law, which was not in accordance with the beliefs of ordinary Somalis. Consequently, people lived in fear as there were serious punishments if al-Shabaab orders were not obeyed. Women in particular were routinely targeted and were not permitted to engage in trade. In addition, al-Shabaab had made a concerted effort to drive NGOs out of its areas by a number of means, including demanding payment of a \u201cregistration fee\u201d of up to USD 15,000, looting warehouses and threatening workers. In some cases al-Shabaab had stolen aid and confiscated the assets of NGOs to sell for profit. There was therefore no international NGO presence in al-Shabaab controlled areas and health and feeding programmes had been stopped, with significant consequences for the civilian population.\n95. Finally, sources were asked about the conditions in IDP camps. They indicated that although those with resources had left Mogadishu, there were some 250,000 people displaced within the city and no humanitarian assistance was available to them. Estimates suggested that there were a further 200,000 to 500,000 people in the Afgooye Corridor, which had become increasingly urbanised. It was difficult to give an exact number of the people based in the corridor because, due to the nature of the fighting, a lot of people were going back and forward to Mogadishu. Moreover, access for NGOs was difficult as the corridor was controlled by \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who controlled who and what moved into and out of the area. These \u201cgatekeepers\u201d tended to be opportunists who were not aligned to any particular group but they were able to make assistance from NGOs very difficult. Two NGOs said that it was incredibly difficult to access the corridor and, where access was possible, aid was often diverted. Moreover, landlords in the area were either selling the land that the IDPs lived on or were charging rent that they could not afford, forcing them to move on.\n96. One international NGO believed that there was a hierarchy within the camps, but did not know whether it was based on clan membership or length of residence. Consequently, it could not be guaranteed that majority clan members would not face problems within the IDP camps.\n97. The sources were not aware of any other significant IDP settlements within Somalia.\n##### 2. United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Operational Guidance Note\n98. Operational Guidance Notes (\u201cOGNs\u201d) are produced by the Border and Immigration Agency of the Home Office. They evaluate the general, political and human rights situation in a country and provide guidance on the nature and handling of the most common type of claim.\n99. The OGN on Somalia of 1 July 2010 described how fighting by Transitional Federal Government troops, allied militias, and AMISOM forces against anti-government forces in southern and central Somalia had resulted in widespread human rights abuses, including the killing of thousands of civilians, the displacement of more than one million people and widespread property damage, particularly in Mogadishu. However, a fall in clashes between government troops and insurgents had led to a substantial drop in the numbers of civilians killed in fighting in Mogadishu in 2009. The Mogadishu-based Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation stated that 1,739 civilians were killed in fighting in 2009, down from 7,574 in 2008 and 8,636 in 2007. At least 4,911 civilians were wounded and 3,900 families displaced by clashes in 2009.\n100. The report noted that while Mogadishu remained the focus of the insurgency, fighting had occurred in other parts of the country, including Beletweyne, Kismayo, the Gedo and Bakool regions, from Jowhar to Harardhere and around the central towns of Dhusamareb and Beletweyne.\n101. The report indicated that restrictions on movement within Somalia had reduced significantly compared to when the AIT considered the situation in AM and AM (Somalia). In particular, checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government had decreased and there were no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints in 2009. Al-Shabaab had established checkpoints at the exit/entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons. It checked goods, searched people and ensured that its strict Islamic codes were enforced, but it did not collect money. There were also reports that Al-Shabaab had eradicated extortion, robbery and murder from bandits in areas it controlled.\n102. With the exception of Mogadishu, there were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns, as was common in previous years. There were, however, several checkpoints on the route from Mogadishu towards the Central Regions and some precautions could be necessary, particularly during militia fighting. There was no evidence that those not of adverse interest to the Transitional Federal Government,\nal-Shabaab or groups such as Hizbul Islam or Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca, would be unable to pass through checkpoints safely. During overland trips clan protection was not required unless ongoing animosities between two rival clans were involved. Individuals would not generally need an escort, but if they considered an escort to be necessary, it would be feasible for them to arrange one either before or after arrival. It would therefore be feasible for many to return to their home areas from Mogadishu International Airport as most areas were more accessible than previously.\n103. The report also noted that it was possible for Somalis to fly from Mogadishu International Airport directly to Hargeisa, in Somaliland, a region which was widely considered to be relatively safe. However, the authorities in Somaliland, like the authorities in Puntland, would only admit those who originated from the territory or those who had close affiliation to the territory through clan membership. In Somaliland, the majority clan was the Isaaq.\n104. With regard to the human rights situation, the report noted that:\n\u201cAl-Shabaab currently controls much of southern and central Somalia, including large portions of Mogadishu. The Transitional Federal Government has maintained control of a few areas in the south east of the city, government installations, the Presidential palace and strategic locations such as the airport and seaport. Al-Shabaab controls large portions of Mogadishu including the north and north-east parts of the city, the main stadium and the main market. It controls nearly all of Middle and Lower Jubba regions, Gedo region, Bay region, Bakool region, and parts of Lower Shabelle region. This includes control of the key port cities of Kismayo and Marka and the Kenya border town of Diif. It also wields significant influence in Middle Shabelle and Hiraan region.\nThe human rights situation has deteriorated particularly in areas controlled by\nal-Shabaab and allied extremist groups. Al-Shabaab and other armed groups have continued to violate women\u2019s rights in southern and central Somalia. Women face arbitrary detention, restriction of movement and other forms of abuse for failure to obey orders, including non-observance of dress codes. There is a rising pattern of inhuman and degrading treatment, including stoning, amputations, floggings and corporal punishment. Men too are subjected to inhuman and cruel treatment for their illicit relationship with women and other offences such as \u2018spying\u2019. Journalists have been repeatedly subjected to threats and short-term arbitrary detentions, particularly in Baidoa and Kismayo. Al-Shabaab has increasingly targeted civil society groups, peace activists, media and human rights organisations. Humanitarian assistance has been severely hampered by the prevailing insecurity and threats specifically targeting humanitarian agencies. In southern and central Somalia there is evidence that children are being exposed to recruitment into armed forces by all parties to the conflict.\u201d\n105. In respect of the humanitarian situation, the report indicated that by November 2009 the total number of displaced persons had reached 1.55 million, 93% of whom were concentrated in southern and central areas, including 524,000 in the Afgooye corridor. The security situation was having a negative impact on the relief operation. Rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations, as well as the imposition of demands from armed groups, had made it virtually impossible for the World Food Programme (\u201cWFP\u201d) to continue reaching people in need in southern Somalia. Inflammatory statements by al-Shabaab against relief organisations, threats against humanitarian staff, explicit rejection of foreign food aid and demands for fees had all worsened.\n106. The report concluded that while the general humanitarian situation in southern and central Somalia was poor, it was not so serious as to cause, in itself, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Aid agencies were subjected to obstructions and dangers in delivering aid to IDPs but most of those in need continued to be reached and efforts were being strengthened to sustain critical food operations in southern and central Somalia. Each case therefore had to be considered on its individual merits in order to assess whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, the Article 3 threshold was met.\n#### B. United States\u2019 Government Reports\n1. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, Somalia, 2009 (11 March 2010)\n107. The report indicated that the Transitional Federal Government\u2019s respect for human rights had improved. However, the poor human rights situation in Somalia had deteriorated further during the year, especially in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab and allied extremist groups. Human rights abuses included unlawful and politically motivated killings, kidnappings, torture, rape, amputations, beatings, official impunity, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, and arbitrary arrest and detention.\n108. With regard to movement within Somalia, the report indicated that checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government and its associated militias had decreased. According to a report by UNOCHA, al-Shabaab established checkpoints at the exit/entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons. There were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns, as was common in previous years. There were also no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints during the year.\n2. \u201cSomalia: Current Conditions and Prospects for a Lasting Peace\u201d, Congressional Research Service, 16 December 2010\n109. The report noted that the humanitarian situation in Somalia remained dire as the fighting in Mogadishu had added more challenges to already poor conditions on the ground. An estimated 1.1 million people had been displaced and more than 475,000 had fled to neighbouring countries in the past two years. Targeted attacks on humanitarian groups had made delivery of assistance difficult and the Obama Administration had suspended assistance in areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n#### C. The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration Country of Origin Centre Somalia: Security and Conflict in the South (23 August 2010)\n110. The report noted that the situation in southern Somalia and in Mogadishu in particular was unstable and the power balance in the regions, districts and urban areas could change almost from day to day. Consequently, information on area control could become out of date very quickly.\n111. It was clear, however, that the military and political situation remained extremely complicated. Large areas of southern Somalia were controlled by al-Shabaab and other Islamist groups in opposition to the authorities. Many areas of Mogadishu had been the scene of shooting, shelling and fighting between Islamists and Government forces supported by AMISOM. In spite of a certain amount of stability in parts of the country, the civilian population was still the victim of indiscriminate violence, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than previously. Leading observers agreed that the situation was fragile as the Islamist groups had the will and means to continue to fight, while the Transitional Federal Government was weak and probably would not survive without the presence of AMISOM.\n112. The UN Special Envoy for Human Rights, together with a number of other international observers, noted that the arrival of foreign jihadists in Somalia had resulted in al-Shabaab operations becoming \u201cprofessionalised\u201d, which meant that they were implemented with greater precision and brutality. According to a number of observers, individual al-Shabaab cells were controlled by foreign jihadists who did not wish for peace or to enter into any form of dialogue with the authorities.\n113. With regard to the humanitarian situation, the report noted that while the nutritional situation was expected to improve in the year ahead on account of a good harvest, the food security situation remained poor. Food prices were high and access to clean drinking water remained a considerable problem.\n114. Estimates indicated that the total number of displaced persons in Somalia was around 1.3 million. Resources in local areas were stretched to the maximum as the displaced from Mogadishu sought refuge in traditional clan areas. While clan members were prepared to share what resources they had as far as possible, displaced persons without clan connections did not have that safety net and were therefore in a more difficult position. However, the report quoted the UN Special Envoy as stating:\n\u201cMonitoring the human rights situation in south and central Somalia remains very difficult due to the serious constraints on gathering information owing to security conditions. The independent expert was himself unable to visit the region. Nevertheless, major human rights concerns have been documented and the independent expert remains deeply concerned at the deterioration of the situation.\u201d\n115. The report noted that freedom of movement in Somalia had improved since January 2009 and the general impression was that the population could travel relatively freely in both government controlled areas and areas controlled by other groups. The removal of road blocks had had a positive effect on criminality as cases of \u201crape and run\u201d had previously been widespread in these areas. However, in spite of the improvements, restrictions imposed by al-Shabaab on women restricted their freedom of movement and had a negative impact on their families, which were often dependant on women\u2019s income from trading.\n116. International organisations had increasingly been the target of violent attacks since 2008 and, because of the safety risk, only a few international representatives remained in southern Somalia. Like the UN and foreign embassies, business was run from main offices in Nairobi while local employees were responsible for work on the ground in Somalia. Local human rights organisations could not publish detailed reports for fear of their own safety. However, aid work in Somalia could be risky for local employees as they were increasingly coming under attack.\n117. In any case, aid organisations had limited access in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab. In January 2010 the WFP decided to suspend its activities in the al-Shabaab controlled areas. This has had consequences for the population in Lower Shabelle Bay, Bakool and Gedo as access to the necessary food supplies and other aid was limited. Moreover, at the beginning of August 2010, al-Shabaab ordered the Adventist Development and Relief Agency, World Vision and Diakonia out of the areas under their control on the ground that they were operating missionary activities. With these three organisations gone, very few international aid organisations remained in place in southern Somalia.\n118. With regard to the situation in Mogadishu, the report noted that conditions in the different areas varied and there was a difference between the northern and southern parts of the capital. The areas of Hodan, Hawl, Wadaag, Wardhingley, Yaqshiid, Bondheere, Shibis and Abdulaziz were the hardest hit by shelling and attacks. To a lesser extent, the districts of Medina, Dharkley, Hamar Weyne, Waaberi and Hamar Jajab were also affected by the fighting. However, the report noted that the situation was unpredictable and could easily change. For example, the Karaan district in the north had previously been considered relatively peaceful but was now shot to pieces and all its inhabitants had fled.\n119. According to a well-informed international aid worker, ten people per week died in Mogadishu due to fighting. It was difficult to estimate how many of the dead were civilians. It was also difficult accurately to estimate the number of displaced. According to the UNCHR, there were around 370,000 displaced persons in Mogadishu and 360,000 in the Afgooye Corridor. However, it was possible that there were great margins of error as the UN estimates were based on satellite images and it was thought that many houses had been built to mislead aid organisations. Nevertheless, well-informed sources indicated that the situation in Somalia today was much more difficult than it had been at the beginning of the 1990s as international organisations were no longer able to carry out their tasks. Poverty was more widespread in Mogadishu than it had been previously and it was therefore more difficult to help those in need. In addition, the clan system had been weakened.\n120. Outside Mogadishu the fighting was mostly localised around certain key areas and towns. Strategic towns such as Kismayo, Beletweyne and various towns in the Galgaduud had changed hands many times in recent years and there were also tensions in Bakool and Gedo. However, the main challenge for most of the population of southern Somalia was humanitarian. Fifteen percent of all children under five in southern Somalia were malnourished and medical treatment was limited, especially in villages, where it was estimated that there was one doctor per 25,000 inhabitants.\n#### D. United Nations Reports\n##### 1. The UN Secretary-General\u2019s Reports\n121. In his report to the Security Council on 11 May 2010, the Secretary General noted that there had been increased fighting in southern and central Somalia during the first three months of 2010. Over 110,000 people had been displaced during this period. In addition to the fighting in Mogadishu, there was also continued fighting between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam in Lower Juba and Lower Shabelle, and between al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca in the central region. National United Nations staff faced direct threats from armed groups in these areas and the presence of international staff in these regions was restricted.\n122. The security situation continued to have a direct impact on the provision of humanitarian aid. The report noted that on 28 February 2008 al-Shabaab called for the termination of all World Food Programme (\u201cWFP\u201d) operations inside Somalia, and on 1 March 2010 and 7 April 2010 WFP compounds in Buale and Wajid were occupied by al-Shabaab. There had been no food distribution to over 300,000 IDPs in the Afgooye corridor since November 2009 owing to inaccessibility and another 1.1 million intended beneficiaries were not receiving food distributions throughout the south and central regions.\n123. In his report to the Security Council on 9 September 2010, the Secretary General noted that volatility and insecurity had once again increased in Mogadishu. AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government frequently engaged the insurgents in response to mortar fire and direct attacks and military operations to secure positions in key districts of Mogadishu led to fierce battles. Moreover, the frequency of attacks with improvised explosive devices had led to an increase in civilian casualties during the reporting period. According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 1,600 civilian casualties were admitted to the two main hospitals in Mogadishu from 20 March 2010 to 11 July 2010. That figure, which included almost 400 children under the age of 5 and 48 registered deaths, had left Mogadishu\u2019s already weak health services struggling to cope with the casualties. He also reported that beyond Mogadishu, sporadic clashes between al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca continued in the central regions and the continuing insecurity had hampered UN operations in Somalia by limiting freedom of movement for UN staff and contractors. In July 2010 al-Shabaab seized the compound of the World Food Programme and the houses of six national staff.\n124. The ongoing conflict, particularly in Mogadishu, had displaced 179,000 people in the first quarter and 75,000 people in the second quarter of 2010.\n125. In the Secretary-General\u2019s report of 9 November 2010 on children and armed conflict in Somalia, he noted that civilians, including children, continued to be the majority of casualties in Somalia, primarily as a result of being caught in the crossfire between the parties to the conflict, shelling and explosions. During 2009 3.64 million people, including approximately 1.8 million children, relied on humanitarian assistance. However, food supplies remained disrupted, access to clean water and medical assistance hindered, and hospitals were stretched to capacity. As from January 2010, food distribution by the World Food Programme was disrupted in all areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n126. Moreover, the climate of violence and impunity exacerbated grave violations of children\u2019s rights as individuals were taking advantage of the lack of rule of law and the availability of arms to commit violent crimes against children and other vulnerable members of the population. This was borne out by evidence of rising levels of acts of sexual violence against children. Most at risk were women and girls living on the streets or in open and unprotected settlements for IDPs. In addition, available information indicated that al-Shabaab had undertaken systematic and widespread recruitment of children for use in the conflict. Indeed, it was alleged that at the Galduuma base between Bay and Lower Shabelle, al-Shabaab had 1,800 children, some as young as 9 years old.\n127. In his most recent report to the Security Council, dated 28 April 2011, the Secretary General stated that a major military offensive against Al-Shabaab had begun on 19 February 2011. The offensive by the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama\u2019a and other groups allied with the Transitional Federal Government against Al-Shabaab in southern central Somalia had focused on the Ethiopia-Kenya-Somalia border. Hostilities centred on the Gedo, Bay and Bakool regions, with armed conflict most prevalent in Bula Hawa and, to a lesser extent, in the vicinity of Beletweyne and Dolo. Troops allied with the Transitional Federal Government had taken control of the town of Dhobley, close to the Kenyan border, on 3 April 2011. Reports of heavy casualties and intensified recruitment efforts on the part of\nAl-Shabaab suggested that the group\u2019s capabilities might have been reduced. However, Al-Shabaab continued to receive arms and ammunition through southern Somali ports and acquire financial resources from extortion, illegal exports and taxation.\n2. Report of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia, Shamsul Bari (16 September 2010)\n128. At the date the report was drafted, heavy fighting had again broken out in Mogadishu and International Committee of the Red Cross reported that hospitals were swamped with war-wounded. According to a report by the Elman Peace Center of Somalia, in the first seven months of 2010 918 civilians died and 2,555 were injured as a result of the increased fighting and shelling. While most casualties appeared to have been the result either of attacks by al-Shabaab and its allies against Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces or retaliatory attacks by AMISOM, direct fighting between Islamists such as Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca and al-Shabaab combined with inter-clan clashes in central Somalia also contributed to the high number of deaths. In addition, reports indicated that parties to the conflict had failed to adhere to the principles of international humanitarian law relating to the protection of civilians as hostilities had been waged in urban areas and precautionary measures to avoid civilian casualties had been disregarded.\n129. With regard to the human rights situation in areas under\nal-Shabaab\u2019s control, United Nations Workers recorded reports of nine executions by firing squad or stoning, mostly for alleged spying or murder, five cases of amputation, mostly of suspected thieves, and the flogging or whipping of some twenty-eight individuals. In addition, seven cases of beheading were reported, including those of five workers allegedly killed in April 2010 because they were involved in reconstruction work at the Parliament, and two people were allegedly shot dead in June 2010 when they fled from a house in Mogadishu raided by Hizbul Islam because they were watching a World Cup match.\n130. Displacement also continued to be a problem. According to a UNHCR report, during the first seven months of 2010 50,065 Somalis sought refuge in neighbouring countries and over 200,000 were internally displaced. As of the end of July 2010, there were 600,484 Somali refugees, mainly hosted in Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Tanzania and Uganda. In addition, 1.4 million Somalis were internally displaced. Assessments conducted revealed that there was a high prevalence of sexual violence in IDP camps, victims were generally of minority clan origin, bereft of clan protection and often forced to engage in risky coping mechanisms.\n131. Recruitment of children to be put on the front line remained an issue of major concern. Although recent media attention highlighted the presence of children within the ranks of forces linked to the Government, the majority of reports of new instances of child recruitment attributed responsibility to anti-Government elements.\n132. The report further noted that a public health crisis persisted in southern and central Somalia. While good rains between April and June 2010 had improved the food security situation, two million people (27 percent of the total population of Somalia) continued to face a humanitarian crisis. Moreover, the number of acutely malnourished children was estimated to be 230,000, of which 35,000 were severely malnourished, and the majority of these were in southern and central Somalia. The forced movement of people on account of the conflict also limited access to clean water and basic health services.\n3. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Somalia (\u201cthe Eligibility Guidelines\u201d), 5 May 2010\n133. UNHCR\u2019s Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Somalia (\u201cthe Eligibility Guidelines\u201d) were published on 5 May 2010. The Eligibility Guidelines noted that over the last three years there had been a consistent failure by all parties to respect basic principles of international humanitarian law, resulting in civilians regularly being caught in the cross-fire. Indiscriminate bombardment and military offensives were carried out in civilian areas with little or no regard for the rules of war and road-side and vehicle-borne bombs, grenade attacks in civilian areas, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets were all too frequent. Hospital records indicated that there were over 900 civilian casualties in Mogadishu in March and April 2010. Other estimates suggested that between 20 and 50 civilians were killed in Mogadishu each week.\n134. While the armed conflict was a major cause of displacement, the report noted that increasing numbers of Somalis were fleeing due to fear of persecution linked to the recent political and human rights situation. Others feared persecution due to perceived or actual contravention of traditional Somali social norms and practices. These groups included members of minority clans, women of specific profiles, victims of blood feuds, Christian converts, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n135. Consequently, UNHCR concluded that the widespread disregard of their obligations under international law by all of the parties to the conflict and the reported scale of human rights violations made it clear that any person returned to southern and central Somalia would, solely on account of his or her presence there, face a real risk of serious harm. Moreover, UNHCR considered that there was no internal flight alternative available inside southern and central Somalia.\n136. UNHCR identified three potential agents of persecution. First, there were Islamic militant groups such as al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam. Both groups had been accused of, and both had admitted to, using the civilian population as human shields during military operations. Both groups also had conducted a systematic campaign of intimidation and assassination of civilians working for, associated with, or perceived to be collaborating with the Transitional Federal Government, AMISOM or the Ethiopian forces. They had also recruited young people and children into their ranks, often with threats of force and violence. Finally, they had set up Islamist administrations in areas under their control and issued decrees to restrict social behaviour. The enforcement of these decrees was often extreme and abusive and violations were punished severely by Sharia courts.\n137. Secondly, UNHCR indicated that business persons and civil society figures were particularly at risk as a result of the increased criminality in Mogadishu.\n138. Finally, UNHCR identified the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM as potential agents of persecution. It noted that both groups were accused of indiscriminately shelling civilian areas of Mogadishu in reprisal to mortar attacks launched by opposition forces. In addition, both groups had also been accused of firing at civilians.\n139. The report further noted that effective State protection was unavailable in southern and central Somalia given the situation of armed conflict and the inability of the government authorities to extend control over any territory outside a few districts in Mogadishu. Moreover, since 2007 clan protection had been undermined in Mogadishu and increasingly in other regions of southern and central Somalia by the ongoing conflict and by the diminution of the traditional clan systems of justice due to the favoured strict interpretations of Sharia law being implemented by\nal-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam in areas under their control.\n#### E. Non-Governmental Organisations\u2019 Reports\n1. Amnesty International: No End in Sight \u2013 The Ongoing Suffering of Somalia\u2019s Civilians (25 March 2010)\n140. Amnesty International noted that civilians in Mogadishu and other cities such as Dhusamareb in central Somalia and Beletweyne in the Hiran region continued to be killed and seriously injured due to the fighting between the armed opposition groups and pro-TGF forces. It noted that:\n\u201cno party to the conflict appears to take the necessary precautions to avoid loss of civilian life and injury, despite their obligations to do so under international humanitarian law. Civilians are often caught up in shelling and cross-fire by all parties to the conflict, resulting in death and injury to thousands. The fighting has provoked massive displacement within and outside cities in south and central Somalia and disruption of access to humanitarian aid, which are already curtailed by insecurity and the targeting of aid workers. Civilians living in areas controlled by armed opposition groups are also increasingly subject to abduction, torture and unlawful killings.\u201d\n141. With regard to the security situation in Mogadishu, they noted that:\n\u201cThere are near weekly incidents of fighting and shelling between armed opposition groups on one side and Transitional Federal Government forces and AMISOM troops on the other side, and near weekly reports of civilian deaths and injuries as a result. Armed opposition groups continue to launch attacks from areas inhabited or frequented by civilians in Mogadishu, endangering the lives of civilians. They fire mortars and heavy artillery in the direction of Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM bases, near which civilians live. Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces are repeatedly accused of responding by firing mortars and using other artillery weapons in the direction of the attackers. All sides to the conflict use mortars and other heavy artillery, weapons which are inherently indiscriminate when used in densely populated urban areas. Some sources have even alleged to Amnesty International that AMISOM is firing BM or \u201cKatyusha\u201d rockets when responding to attacks by armed opposition groups. These attacks and counter-attacks invariably result in civilian deaths and injuries.\u201d\n142. The report indicated that the delivery of emergency humanitarian aid to Somalia was shrinking, as aid workers were coming under attack and armed groups were imposing restrictions on the movement of international agencies working in areas under their control. In particular, it noted that:\n\u201cOn 11 October 2009, Hizbul Islam in the Banadir region asked all humanitarian organisations operating in areas under their control to register within 15 days and pay a registration fee by 25 October, whilst al-Shabab in the Juba region renewed their ban against any agency wishing to operate in the region, stating \u201cWe want our people to work for their life rather than depending on food aid.\u201d\nIn November, al-Shabaab in Bay and Bakool regions issued a list of 11 conditions which humanitarian organisations were required to adhere to in order to continue their work in the regions. These conditions reportedly included replacing all female staff members with men within three months, an agreement not to encourage secularism or democracy in their work and a payment of $20,000 US dollars every six months to the al-Shabaab administration. This was followed on 25 November by an al-Shabaab statement ordering the World Food Programme (WFP) to immediately cease the import of relief food to the country, accusing the organisation of acting as a barrier to self-sufficiency. All local businesspeople were ordered to terminate their contracts with the WFP and the organisation was ordered to empty their warehouses and\nfood-stocks by 1 January 2010.\u201d\n143. On 4 January 2010 the World Food Programme suspended its work in southern Somalia due to insecurity for its staff and the demands placed on them by parties to the conflict. Ninty-five percent of the areas from which the organisation had withdrawn were under the control of al-Shabaab, and al-Shabaab subsequently indicated that it would never permit the organisation to return. However, Amnesty International noted that over half of Somalia\u2019s population was dependent on food aid and many of those people lived in the areas that the WFP had withdrawn from.\n144. The report also noted that the WFP had experienced difficulties in delivering food to the IDP settlements in Afgooye, where some 360,000 persons displaced by the conflict were thought to live. On 28 February 2010 armed men stopped trucks transporting food aid from Mogadishu to Afgooye and the WFP have since stated that the last time they organised a general food distribution in Afgooye was in November 2009.\n##### 2. Amnesty International Briefing Paper, 18 October 2010\n145. The report indicated that civilians in Mogadishu continued to bear the brunt of the fighting and were often caught up in shelling and cross-fire by all parties to the conflict. There were nearly weekly incidents of fighting and shelling between armed opposition groups on one side and Transitional Federal Government forces and AMISOM troops on the other, and near weekly civilian deaths and injuries as a result.\n146. Medical records of the Daynile hospital on the outskirts of Mogadishu showed that for the first seven months of 2010 48 percent of its patients were suffering war-related injuries and 38 percent of those patients were women and children. Between June and July 2010, hundreds of civilians were killed or injured in Mogadishu. Some field reports claimed that there were as many as fifty deaths in one day, while UNHCR estimated that during the last week of August and the first week of September 2010, 230 civilians were killed and 400 were injured in fighting.\n147. Likewise, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res stated that between 23 August and 24 September 2010 its medical team in Daynile hospital treated 542 war-wounded people and performed over 200 surgeries. Following intense fighting on 23 September 2010 MSF treated 161 war-wounded patients in one day.\n148. The African Union recently signalled its intention to increase the number of AMISOM troops to 8,000 and Amnesty International believed that when this happened it was likely to result in more attacks against the force by armed Islamist groups and more retaliatory shelling by AMISOM.\n149. The report noted that the fighting had also caused the destruction of homes, the separation of families during chaotic flight, and massive displacement. UNHCR estimated that 42,400 people had been displaced from within and around Mogadishu since 23 August 2010, some 25,400 having fled Mogadishu and about 17,100 others having moved to different parts of the city.\n150. Al-Shabaab had also been seizing cities elsewhere in southern and central Somalia. In particular, there had been clashes in and around Kismayo, Dhusamareb, Beletweyne and Dobley. As a result, 29,000 civilians had been displaced from Dhusamareb and 25,000 had been displaced from Beletweyne. In addition to the fighting, al-Shabaab had also severely restricted humanitarian access in most of southern and central Somalia, putting civilians at risk. According to the report, humanitarian access in southern Somalia was at its lowest since the end of 2006.\n151. In addition to indiscriminate attacks and the situation of generalised violence, certain categories of people were particularly at risk of targeted killing. These categories included people linked with the Transitional Federal Government, civil society activists, aid workers and journalists. Children and young men were also at high risk of being forcibly recruited to fight for the armed Islamist groups.\n##### 3. Amnesty International \u2013 From Life Without Peace to Peace Without Life\n152. This report, which was published on 8 December 2010, focussed on the treatment of Somali refugees and asylum-seekers in Kenya, which hosted the largest number of Somali refugees in the region. As of September 2010, there were 338,151 registered refugees in the region, but it was estimated that the actual number was much higher.\n153. In 2007 the Kenyan authorities closed the country\u2019s border with Somalia and, according to estimates of Kenyan NGOs, thousands of Somali refugees were subsequently returned to Somalia by the Kenyan security forces. Some were expelled at the border while others were denied entry altogether. Many of these refugees were women and children who, according to UNHCRs eligibility guidelines, should have been granted international protection.\n154. Amnesty International also received numerous reports of the Kenyan police at the closed border threatening asylum-seekers with forced removal to Somalia in order to extort bribes or arresting or detaining asylum-seekers until they paid a bribe. In addition, Somali asylum-seekers were often arbitrarily arrested, detained and charged with \u201cillegal entry\u201d.\n155. Prior to the closure of the border, new refugees were registered and medically screened at an UNHCR-administered transit centre 15km from the border before being transported to refugee camps. When the border closed, this transit centre also closed with the consequence that refugees who made it to Kenya had to travel a further 80km to the refugee camps before they could be registered. This journey was often a dangerous one, during which Kenyan police were able to commit abuses against them with impunity.\n156. Approximately 280,000 registered Somali refugees were confined to three refugee camps in Dadaab in north eastern Kenya, which were originally intended to accommodate 90,000 refugees. As a result of the severe overcrowding, access to shelter, water, sanitation and other essential services was impeded. As no plots of land were available, new refugees could not build shelters and instead had to stay with relatives or clan members. In addition, the water infrastructure was only designed for one third of the number of people currently living in the camps and, as a result, many refugees complained that the allocation of water was insufficient. Those living at the edges of the camps often had to walk long distances to collect water.\n157. Refugees also complained of insecurity in the camps, which they attributed either to tensions between different clans or to the alleged presence of members of or sympathisers with al-Shabaab. Incidences of theft and sexual abuse were on the increase. Aid and protection agencies told Amnesty International that there were not enough police officers present in the camps adequately to address security incidents. In any case, refugees often distrusted the Kenyan police as many had been the victim of abuses by the security forces while on their way to the camps.\n158. In October 2009 reports emerged that the Kenyan security forces were recruiting Somali refugees for military training in order to fight for the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia. UNHCR subsequently launched an awareness campaign in the camps, warning refugees that they would lose their refugee status if they joined armed groups.\n159. Somali refugees in the Dadaab camps were generally not permitted to leave the camps, unless in exceptional circumstances, and they had almost no livelihood opportunities. They did, however, receive free humanitarian assistance in the camps.\n##### 4. Human Rights Watch: Harsh War, Harsh Peace\n160. In this report, published in April 2010, Human Rights Watch documented abuses by al-Shabaab, the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM in Somalia. The report indicated that over the past year, hostilities had raged in strategically important areas, like Mogadishu, while much of the rest of Somalia enjoyed relative peace. However, the report concluded that both the inhabitants of the shattered capital and those living in more peaceful areas had endured devastating patterns of abuse.\n161. In Mogadishu and in other conflict areas in southern and central Somalia the fighting had exacted a heavy toll on civilians. In particular, the report noted that all parties to the conflict had conducted numerous mortar attacks against enemy forces in densely populated areas of Mogadishu without regard for the civilian population, causing a high loss of civilian life and property. While mortars could be highly accurate weapons if guided to their targets by spotters or guidance systems, none of the warring parties in Mogadishu had employed such methods. Opposition armed groups had indiscriminately fired mortar rounds in the general direction of Transitional Federal Government or AMISOM installations in southern Mogadishu. Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces sometimes responded in kind, directing mortar rounds towards the general area they had taken fire from or simply bombarding areas such as Bakara Market that were opposition strongholds. Such attacks, while of limited military value, caused considerable loss of civilian life and property damage.\n162. The report noted that there had been sporadic fighting between other groups outside Mogadishu which had exacted a heavy toll on civilians. For example, clashes between Hizbul Islam and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca around the central towns of Dhusamareb and Beletweyne displaced more that 25,000 people at the beginning of 2010.\n163. The report further indicated that humanitarian workers had been targeted. According to the Office of the UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, 47 aid workers were killed in Somalia in 2008 and 2009. Humanitarian workers also faced a variety of other threats, from the broader trend of indiscriminate violence in conflict areas to al-Shabaab accusations of spying on behalf of western powers. For example, in early 2009 the WFP suspended delivery of food aid to a vast swath of southern Somalia controlled largely by al-Shabaab, citing the group\u2019s escalating attacks and harassment against its staff and \u201cunacceptable\u201d demands for payment.\n164. Forced and unlawful recruitment was also a problem. The report noted that opposition forces, especially but not exclusively al-Shabaab, were expanding their ranks by threatening those who resisted with death and at times carrying out their threats. In addition, both insurgent groups and government forces were recruiting and using child soldiers to varying degrees and had entered refugee camps in Kenya to enlist additional fighters. The report noted that al-Shabaab had recruited children in a more deliberate and systematic manner than the Transitional Federal Government or other armed groups. Thus the recruitment of children \u2013 and the fear of it \u2013 was widespread in many areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n165. The report stated that in areas controlled by al-Shabaab (much of the south of Somalia), the population was subjected to targeted killings and assaults, a repressive form of social control and brutal punishments under its draconian interpretation of Sharia law, which went well beyond its traditional interpretation in Somalia. While in many areas al-Shabaab\u2019s rule had brought relative peace and order, security came at a steep price. In many areas, al-Shabaab dictated even minute details of daily life, from clothing styles to prayer observance to cell phone ring tones. The report indicated that:\n\u201cAl-Shabaab exerts enormous control over personal lives and devotes remarkable energy to policing and penalizing conduct that it deems idle or immoral. Almost no detail is too minute to escape the group\u2019s scrutiny. In many areas, al-Shabaab administrators have banned public gatherings, dancing at weddings, musical ringtones on cell phones, western music, and movies. They have outlawed qat chewing and cigarette smoking. They have barred men from shaving their beards and moustaches, or wearing long hair or long trousers. They have refused to allow people on the streets during prayer times.\nIn many areas, al-Shabaab patrols break up public gatherings, no matter how small, unless they are the organizers. Frequently, al-Shabaab justifies the dispersals on the grounds that participants are engaged in \u2018idle\u2019 or \u2018useless\u2019 activity, a concept that is arbitrarily applied and often includes everything from playing soccer to talking among friends. \u2018If they find a group of people talking, they may just beat them and tell them to go and do something useful\u2019, said one man from the border village of El Wak.\nOne young man from Kismayo said he watched an al-Shabaab patrol throw a group of teenage boys in jail one evening for playing Scrabble:\n\u2018They said this was idle activity. They took them away and jailed them overnight and shaved some of their heads with a razor blade or a broken bottle. One of them was injured from the shaving. They won\u2019t even let people gather to listen to the BBC, or to smoke tobacco.\u2019\u201d\n166. Human Rights Watch also interviewed a widower in an IDP camp in the Afgoye corridor, who claimed that al-Shabaab gunmen had threatened to kill him if he didn\u2019t stop tucking in his shirt, which they criticised as a western custom.\n167. Human Rights Watch noted that while all Somalis living under local al-Shabaab administrations had to cope with onerous and repressive edicts, women bore the brunt of the group\u2019s repression and abuse. In particular, some al-Shabaab leaders had ordered women to wear a particularly thick and bulky type of abaya, an over-gown which covered everything except the hands, face and feet. Al-Shabaab fighters would patrol neighbourhoods and punish women in lighter-weight abayas. In many cases women were beaten or whipped for wearing the wrong clothing.\n168. In addition, al-Shabaab administrations ordered women to close their shops as commercial activity permitted them to \u201cmix with men\u201d. In a country with a vast number of war widows and female-headed households, this edict left many families without crucial sources of income. Moreover, the segregation of men and women applied to all areas of daily life. Women were not permitted to go to the market with men, even if they were relatives, and if travelling in a vehicle, they had to sit in different seats. There were reports of women being flogged at checkpoints if they were found to be sitting beside a man.\n169. Finally, the report noted that in many areas, al-Shabaab leaders had embraced amputations and executions as punishment and turned them into a public spectacle. Since 2008 at least three people had been stoned to death for allegedly committing adultery. There were some unconfirmed reports that one of these people was a thirteen year old girl.\n##### 5. Human Rights Watch: World Report 2010\n170. Human Rights Watch Annual World Report summarised the situation in Somalia as \u201cone of the world\u2019s worst human rights catastrophes\u201d. Mogadishu was wracked by indiscriminate warfare in which all parties were implicated in war crimes or other serious human rights abuses, while much of the rest of the country was under the control of local administrations linked to armed opposition groups. In many of these areas the population had suffered from the abusive application of Sharia law and forced conscription of civilians, including children, as militia fighters. In addition, a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions was unfolding, fuelled by years of drought and insecurity that had often prevented the effective delivery of aid. Some 3.75 million people \u2013 roughly half of Somalia\u2019s remaining population \u2013 were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. More than a million people were displaced from their homes within Somalia and tens of thousands had fled the country as refugees in 2009.\n171. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia had been severely hampered by the prevailing insecurity and by threats specifically targeting humanitarian agencies. Most of the humanitarian agencies operating in Somalia had had to dramatically curtail their operations or had been driven out of southern and central Somalia altogether. In\nopposition-controlled areas where millions of Somalis were in need of assistance, humanitarians had come under regular threat by al-Shabaab and other groups which accused them of colluding with international efforts to back the Transitional Federal Government.\n##### 6. Human Rights Watch \u2013 \u201cWelcome to Kenya\u201d: Police Abuse of Somali Refugees\n172. This report, which was published in June 2010, details the continuing abuses perpetrated by the Kenyan authorities against Somali refugees and asylum-seekers. It noted that despite the closure of the border, more than 140,000 refugees entered Kenya and registered at the Dadaab camps between 1 January 2007 and 30 April 2010. However, the closure of the border and UNHCR\u2019s transit centre had created a lawless no man\u2019s land in Kenya\u2019s border area near the refugee camps. Consequently, asylum-seekers endeavouring to reach the camps were often intercepted by Kenyan police who sought to extort money from them and unlawfully arrest, detain, abuse and even deport those who could not pay.\n173. Human Rights Watch spoke with dozens of Somali refugees whose vehicles had been stopped by police patrolling the border to extort money from them in exchange for free passage to the camps. In some cases, police had raped women and physically assaulted men. In many other cases, refugees were arrested and detained by the police before being permitted to register in the camps. They were detained in overcrowded cells with poor ventilation and no, or almost no, food and water. Some were not permitted to use the toilet and had to use the cell floor to urinate and defecate. Detained refugees were often released upon the payment of a bribe. If they could not pay, they were threatened with court proceedings in a last ditch attempt to extort money from them.\n174. Moreover, Human Rights Watch documented eight separate incidents in which Kenyan police returned asylum-seekers to Somalia. All of these incidents, which involved 152 men, women and children, took place between September 2009 and March 2010. According to this sample, Human Rights Watch estimated that hundreds if not thousands of Somalis were being returned to Somalia each month in breach of the principle of non-refoulement.\n175. Such widespread abuses compelled many asylum-seekers to travel through Kenya on smaller paths where criminals preyed on them, stealing their belongings and raping women.\n176. There were further reports of serious abuses by Kenyan police officers within the refugee camps. Seven refugees told Human Rights Watch of ten separate incidents during which police had violently assaulted them or during which they had observed police assaulting other refugees. One woman complained that she had been raped by a police officer in the camps.\n177. In addition, refugees reported that the police failed to respond to allegations of sexual violence within the camps. In particular, a lack of capacity and expertise impeded the prevention, investigation and prosecution of acts of sexual violence. International policing standards required 1 police officer per 400 people. Although Kenya\u2019s official average was 1 per 800 people, the official ration in the camps was 1 per 5500 people. There were reports that the police would not investigate crimes unless the victims could pay them, and in other cases it was alleged that investigations were discontinued and perpetrators were released upon the payment of a bribe. According to UNHCR, in 2009 police in the camps prosecuted sixteen cases of sexual and gender-based violence of which seven resulted in convictions, six in acquittals, and three remained pending at the end of the year.\n178. Human Rights Watch also reported that since the early 1990s, Kenya had adopted an informal encampment policy for most refugees, restricting their movement to the limited confines of the refugee camps. Refugees found outside the camps without \u201cmovement passes\u201d were arrested, fined and imprisoned for months at a time.\n7. International Displacement Monitoring Centre \u2013 Somalia: Political and security crises, access limits and donor cuts increasing IDP vulnerability (10 December 2009)\n179. The International Displacement Monitoring Centre estimated that as of November 2009 1.55 million people were internally displaced in south and central Somalia. Many IDPs had fled from the conflict in Mogadishu. Hundreds of mini-buses were ferrying people out of the city but, as a result of high demand, the cost of transportation was going up daily and many people were being forced to remain in the city.\n180. Some IDPs had fled from conflict in other areas of southern and central Somalia. The report noted that people in Beletweyne, Kismayo and Afmadow had been displaced as a result of fighting in late 2009. In addition, up to 90 percent of the population of Dhuusamarreeb and Guriceel towns in the Galgaduud region of central Somalia fled their homes after fighting began in December 2008. Many of these people had already been displaced as a result of the fighting in Mogadishu.\n181. Many of the displaced from Mogadishu moved to the already overcrowded settlements that lined the 30 kilometre road between Mogadishu and Afgooye. UNHCR had estimated that in November 2009 there were 610,000 IDPs around Afgooye, 370,000 around Mogadishu, 150,000 in Galgadud, 70,000 in Galkayo (Puntland), 66,000 in Baydhaba and 51,000 in Hiran. However, due to the security situation, it was extremely difficult to verify these figures.\n182. The report further noted that half of the population in Somalia was believed to be in need of humanitarian assistance but the continuing insecurity was preventing the delivery of essential supplies. In May 2009 militia had attacked a UNICEF warehouse. In July 2009 camps in Jowhar hosting 49,000 IDPs were cut off from assistance as the WFP was unable to distribute food due to insecurity. In August 2009 UNICEF were forced to suspend the dispatch of hundreds of tons of supplies for the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition. Targeting of humanitarian workers has also affected delivery of aid to needy populations. From 2008 to November 2009 some 42 aid workers had been killed, 33 had been abducted and 10 remained in captivity.\n183. In July 2009 al-Shabaab announced a ban on a number of UN agencies in areas of southern and central Somalia under its control, including the United Nations Development Agency. Towards the end of November 2009 al-Shabaab demanded that WFP stop importing food into Somalia from January 2010 and instead buy local produce, despite the fact that the country could not meet the food needs of its population. Despite the threats, WFP managed to provide food through local and international partners where security permitted. In the first half of 2009, WFP provided food aid to 2.87 million Somalis. UNICEF and other agencies continued to provide health care and water, sanitation and health programmes in IDP settlements. However, the security situation had impacted these programmes.\n184. Aid work had also been impacted by funding cuts. The USA had withheld millions of dollars from UN agencies, possibly due to a fear that donations may reach al-Shabaab, which was thought to have growing ties with al-Qaeda. In November 2009 WFP reported that its food supply to Somalia had been effectively broken as a result of the USA\u2019s policy as it had been the largest donor to the WFP.\n185. In September 2009 Oxfam reported that poor sanitation and the lack of access to basic services were creating a public health emergency in IDP camps. It described the Afgooye camps as \u201cthe world\u2019s densest concentration of displaced people\u201d and described the situation as \u201ca human tragedy of \u2018unthinkable proportions\u2019\u201d. The camps were also vulnerable to environmental problems. In October 2009 flash floods hit IDP camps in Kismayo and Mogadishu and destroyed the makeshift shelters of thousands of people. In Kismayo, rains left an estimated 36,000 people homeless and exposed them to mosquitoes and other hygiene-related problems.\n186. The report noted that close to 80 percent of the Somali population had no access to safe water and nearly 50 percent had no access to sanitation. Many displaced women were forced to walk up to 10 kilometres each day to fetch water, increasing the risk of being attacked or raped by militias. IDPs often had to pay to use the latrines in the camps in addition to paying rent. As a result, many camps were littered with garbage and faeces, increasing the incidence of disease.\n##### 8. The World Food Programme (\u201cWFP)\u201d\n187. On 5 January 2010 the WFP issued a statement reporting that:\n\u201cRising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations, as well as the imposition of a string of unacceptable demands from armed groups, have made it virtually impossible for the World Food Programme (WFP) to continue reaching up to one million people in need in southern Somalia.\nWFP\u2019s humanitarian operations in southern Somalia have been under escalating attacks from armed groups, leading to this partial suspension of humanitarian food distributions in much of southern Somalia.\nWFP\u2019s offices in Wajid, Buale, Garbahare, Afmadow, Jilib and Beletweyne in southern Somalia are temporarily closed, and food supplies and equipment have been moved, along with staff, to safer areas in order to ensure that food assistance continues to reach as many vulnerable people as possible.\u201d\n188. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) reported in its Special Brief \u2013 Post-Deyr \u201809/10 Analysis issued on 12 February 2010 that Somalia has:\n\u201c... 42% of the population, or an estimated 3.2 million people, in need of emergency humanitarian assistance and/or livelihood support until June 2010. The results indicate that although there are some positive indicators in terms of the lifting of the livestock export ban and improved crop and livestock production in southern parts of the country, the food security and nutrition situation in central regions remains in crisis, where 70% of the population require assistance. The situation is exacerbated by escalating conflict and displacements, creating a double burden for drought affected populations in central regions, having to support those recently displaced yet with reduced access to assistance from aid agencies due to the insecurity.\nEmergency levels of acute malnutrition continue to be reported, with 1 in 6 children in Somalia acutely malnourished and in need of specialist care. Of these children, 1 in 22 is severely malnourished and at a 9 times increased risk of death compared to well-nourished children. However, in south and central Somalia the rates are higher, with 1 in 5 children acutely malnourished of which 1 in 20 is severely malnourished. These national rates of acute malnutrition continue to be amongst the highest in the world. Currently, these rates translate into estimated 240,000 children under 5 years of age in Somalia being acutely malnourished, of which 63,000 are severely malnourished. More than two thirds of these children are located in south and central Somalia, the areas most affected by the current conflict. The people currently in crisis include 1.25 million rural people affected by drought, 580,000 urban people who struggle with very high food and non-food prices, and 1.39 million internally displaced people (IDPs) who are fleeing from the conflict.\u201d\n##### 9. M\u00e9dicins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF)\n189. In a report of 21 December 2009, entitled \u201cTop ten under-reported humanitarian stories of 2009, MSF described the situation in Somalia as follows:\n\u201cIn 2009, the Somali population continued to fall victim to indiscriminate violence, while severe drought plagued parts of the country. Millions of people urgently require health care, yet the enormous gap between the needs of Somalis and the humanitarian response on the ground continues to widen. Ongoing abductions and killings of international and Somali aid workers is thwarting the efforts of humanitarian organizations to respond, and the public health-care system remains in near total collapse.\n...The impact of such high levels of violence and insecurity stretches far beyond MSF\u2019s surgical units, contributing to a general lack of access to basic lifesaving medical care countrywide. MSF\u2019s ability to provide assistance was further diminished when in April two MSF staff members were abducted in Huddur in Bakool region leading to the closure of its largest health centre in south and central Somalia and four other health posts. In June an MSF employee died in an explosion in Belet Weyne, Hiraan region, which killed 30 other people. In July, the heightened insecurity forced MSF, for the first time in 17 years, to close activities in its pediatric hospital and three other health clinics in northern Mogadishu as staff were forced to flee for their own safety.\nAnother major challenge is the lack of qualified medical staff in Somalia, with so many health workers among those who have fled the violence and no medical universities open. In December 2008, there was a ray of hope with the graduation of 20 doctors from Benadir University in Mogadishu\u2014the first graduating class of new physicians in two decades. This hope was short-lived with the bombing of the next graduation ceremony on December 3, 2009, killing 23 people, mostly graduates, and wounding more than 50 others.\nThe lack of free medical care available throughout the country exacerbates the health issues people face as a result of chronic poverty and this year\u2019s severe drought. Although little reliable data is available at the national level, health-care indicators in Somalia are among the worst in terms of immunization, maternal mortality, malnutrition and access to basic health care services. According to the World Health Organization, women have a one in ten lifetime risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth. One in five children under the age of five is acutely malnourished.\u201d\n#### F. Recent news reports\n190. On 16 September 2010 IRIN reported that property owners in Somalia\u2019s Afgooye corridor were selling the land on which thousands of IDPs had been settled for years, displacing them anew. The new landlords were building structures for rent, but few could afford to pay the prices asked. Some well-placed sources had heard reports that the people buying the land had links with piracy.\n191. On 1 October 2010 the UN News Centre reported that according to UNHCR estimates, 410,000 IDPs from Mogadishu had sought refuge in the Afgooye corridor, which represented a considerable increase from 366,000 in September 2009. This increase was thought to be a reflection of the deteriorating security in the city since 2007. In addition to the 410,000 IDPs living in Afgooye, there were another 55,000 displaced people in Dayniile, north of Mogadishu, 15,200 in the Bal\u2019cad corridor in the northern periphery of city, and 7,260 others in Kax Shiiqaal in the western outskirts. Mogadishu itself had an estimated 372,000 IDPs.\n192. The report noted that there had been a rapid urbanisation of the Afgooye corridor, which was clearly apparent in the satellite imagery. Structures in Afgooye were becoming more permanent as hopes faded for a safe return to the capital any time soon. According to UNHCR, living conditions in the Afgooye corridor were extremely difficult, with people struggling to feed themselves and lacking other basic necessities, while as the precarious security situation prevented humanitarian agencies from accessing those in need. Some assistance was getting there through local partners, but the amounts were minuscule compared to the needs.\n193. The Secretary-General\u2019s Special Representative for Somalia, Augustine Mahiga, said that without peace in southern and central Somalia, it would be difficult to envisage profound and lasting changes in the precarious human rights situation there, especially with regard to the right to life, and even basic human rights such as the right to food, shelter, education and health.\n194. On 3 February 2011 the Guardian reported that Somalia was once again facing a malnutrition crisis. An estimated 2.4 million people \u2013 about a third of Somalia\u2019s population \u2013 required humanitarian aid after the failure of recent rains and drought had overtaken insecurity as the leading cause of displacement. In fact, it was reported that as a consequence of the drought, the exodus from conflict-racked Mogadishu in recent years had been reversed, with thousands of people now leaving the countryside for the capital in search of food and water.\n195. On 17 February 2011 UN News Centre reported that severe drought in Somalia was once again exacerbating the humanitarian crisis with more people becoming internally displaced and others moving into refugee camps across the border in Kenya. Malnutrition rates among children, already above emergency levels in Somalia, had risen and an estimated 2.4 million people \u2013 32 per cent of the country\u2019s 7.2 million people \u2013 were in need of relief aid.\nTHE LAW\n196. Given their similar factual and legal background, the Court decides that the two applications should be joined pursuant to Rule 42 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 2 AND 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n197. The applicants complained that their removal to Mogadishu would expose them to a real risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention and/or a violation of Article 2 of the Convention. Articles 2 and 3 provide, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cArticle 2\n1. Everyone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\n...\nArticle 3\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\nThey further complained that their removal would constitute a disproportionate interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n198. The Government contested those arguments.\n199. The Court considers that it is more appropriate to deal with the complaints under Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention in the context of its examination of the related complaint under Article 3 and will proceed on this basis (Said v. the Netherlands, no. 2345/02, \u00a7 37, ECHR 2005\u2011VI; D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, \u00a7 59, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011III; and NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 95, 17 July 2008).\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n200. The Government submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as they did not make fresh claims for asylum under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) in light of the developing situation in Mogadishu. They further submitted that the second applicant also failed to exhaust domestic remedies as he had not applied for an order for reconsideration of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal\u2019s decision pursuant to section 103 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.\n201. Alternatively, the Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 3 of the Convention were manifestly ill-founded.\n202. The applicants submitted that they had exhausted all domestic remedies. First, they submitted that paragraph 353 did not provide a remedy which they were required to exhaust, as the making of a fresh claim was a discretionary remedy and not an automatic right. Secondly, even if paragraph 353 did provide a remedy which they were required to exhaust, the applicants submitted that they were unable to make a fresh claim as the content of their claims had already been considered and they were not in possession of material which could be considered to be \u201csignificantly different\u201d to that previously considered. Thirdly, as the applicants had not been found to be credible, in practice any fresh claim would have had virtually no prospect of success.\n203. The second applicant further submitted that he did not seek an order for reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s decision because he was advised both by his lawyer, a senior lawyer from the Refugee Legal Centre, and Counsel, a highly experienced asylum practitioner, that there were insufficient grounds on which to challenge the decision. The Court had always held that experienced counsel\u2019s opinion to the effect that a remedy had no prospect of success was enough to indicate that an appeal would not be successful (O\u2019Reilly and Others v. Ireland, no. 54725/00, 29 July 2004 and H. v. the United Kingdom, 8 July 1987, Series A no. 120).\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n204. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires applicants first to use the remedies provided by the national legal system, thus dispensing States from answering before the Court for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system. The burden of proof is on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that an effective remedy was available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, namely, that the remedy was accessible, capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, 16 December 1999, \u00a7 55). Article 35 must also be applied to reflect the practical realities of the applicant\u2019s position in order to ensure the effective protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (Hilal v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 45276/99, 8 February 2000).\n205. The Court has consistently held that mere doubts as to the prospects of success of national remedies do not absolve an applicant from the obligation to exhaust those remedies (see, inter alia, Pellegrini v. Italy (dec.), no. 77363/01, 26 May 2005; MPP Golub v. Ukraine (dec.), no. 6778/05, 18 October 2005; and Milosevic v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 77631/01, 19 March 2002). However, it has also on occasion found that where an applicant is advised by counsel that an appeal offers no prospects of success, that appeal does not constitute an effective remedy (see Selvanayagam v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 57981/00, 12 December 2002; see also H. v. the United Kingdom, cited above; and McFeeley and others v. the United Kingdom, no. 8317/78, Commission decision of 15 May 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 20, p. 44). Equally, an applicant cannot be regarded as having failed to exhaust domestic remedies if he or she can show, by providing relevant domestic case-law or any other suitable evidence, that an available remedy which he or she has not used was bound to fail (Kleyn and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], nos. 39343/98, 39651/98, 43147/98 and 46664/99, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2003\u2011VI; Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, \u00a7\u00a7 121 et seq., ECHR 2007\u2011... (extracts)).\n206. The Court accepts that where there has been a significant change in either the applicant\u2019s circumstances or the conditions in his country of origin, making further submissions under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules could constitute an effective domestic remedy which an applicant would be required to exhaust. However, in the present case the Court recalls that after the applicants\u2019 complaints were considered by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, the Tribunal considered a number of other complaints by applicants challenging their removal to Mogadishu. Prior to the Country Guidance decision of AM and AM (Somalia), which was promulgated towards the end of 2008, the Tribunal had consistently held that the situation in Mogadishu, and in Somalia generally, was not sufficiently grave to place anyone being returned at risk of serious harm and that members of majority clans could still look to their clan for protection. As the first applicant\u2019s claim to be a member of a minority clan had not been believed and the second applicant had accepted that he was a member of a majority clan, the Court does not accept that there was a reasonable prospect that the Secretary of State for the Home Department would have accepted any further submissions by the applicants as amounting to fresh claims for asylum prior to the decision in AM and AM (armed conflict: risk categories) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00091.\n207. In AM and AM (Somalia) the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal found that the situation in Mogadishu had changed significantly and that it was no longer a safe place to live for the majority of its citizens. Nevertheless, it also found that it would be possible for persons from Mogadishu to relocate safely within Somalia. In view of this finding, the Court considers it likely that even if the applicants had made further representations following the decision in AM and AM (Somalia), and even if the Secretary of State had considered those representations to amount to a fresh claim for asylum, such a claim would not have been successful as the applicants would have been considered to have had an internal flight alternative within Somalia.\n208. Consequently, in the circumstances of the present case, the Court does not consider that paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules HC 396 (as amended) provided the applicants with an effective domestic remedy which offered reasonable prospects of success. It therefore rejects the Government\u2019s submission that the applicants failed to exhaust domestic remedies on account of the fact that they did not make further representations to the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the situation in Somalia worsened.\n209. With regard to the Government\u2019s submission that the second applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies as he did not apply for an order for reconsideration, the Court recalls that he was advised by a senior lawyer from the Refugee Legal Centre and by experienced counsel that such an application would have had no realistic prospect of success. The Court notes that both the lawyer and counsel advising the second applicant were senior and experienced specialists in the immigration and asylum fields. In these circumstances, the Court has no hesitation in concluding that it was \u201csettled legal opinion\u201d that the applicant would not have succeeded in an application for reconsideration.\n210. The Court therefore also rejects the Government\u2019s submission that the second applicant failed to exhaust an effective domestic remedy by failing to apply for reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n211. Finally, the Court recalls that the Government have also submitted that the applicants\u2019 complaints are manifestly ill-founded. The Court considers that this submission raises questions which are closely linked to the merits of the case. It will therefore deal with that submission in its examination of the merits below. It further notes that the application is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. General principles applicable in expulsion cases\n212. It is settled case-law that Contracting States have the right as a matter of international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (\u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006\u2011....; Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, \u00a7 67, Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997\u2011VI, p. 2264, \u00a7 42). The right to political asylum is also not contained in either the Convention or its Protocols (Salah Sheekh, cited above, \u00a7 135, with further authorities). However, expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 125, 28 February 2008). As the prohibition of torture and of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolute, irrespective of the victims conduct, the nature of the offence allegedly committed by the applicants is irrelevant for the purposes of Article 3 (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, \u00a7 79; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 127). Consequently, the conduct of the applicants, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be taken into account (Saadi v. Italy [GC], \u00a7 138).\n213. The assessment whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assess the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, \u00a7 67, ECHR 2005\u2011I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7 60, ECHR 2001\u2011II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997\u2011III, \u00a7 40).\n214. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (see Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, \u00a7 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 (see N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, \u00a7 167, 26 July 2005). Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any doubts about it.\n215. If the applicant has not yet been extradited or deported when the Court examines the case, the relevant time will be that of the proceedings before the Court (see Saadi v. Italy, cited above, \u00a7 133). A full and ex nunc assessment is called for as the situation in a country of destination may change in the course of time. Even though the historical position is of interest in so far as it may shed light on the current situation and its likely evolution, it is the present conditions which are decisive and it is therefore necessary to take into account information that has come to light after the final decision taken by the domestic authorities (see Salah Sheekh, cited above, \u00a7 136).\n216. The foregoing principles, and in particular the need to examine all the facts of the case, require that this assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of the removal of the applicant to the country of destination. This in turn must be considered in the light of the general situation there as well as the applicant\u2019s personal circumstances (Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, \u00a7 108). In this connection, and where it is relevant to do so, the Court will have regard to whether there is a general situation of violence existing in the country of destination.\n217. In Vilvarajah v. the United Kingdom the Court appeared to suggest that a mere situation of general instability would only give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention if there was evidence to demonstrate that the applicant\u2019s personal situation was worse than that of the generality of other members of his group (Vilvarajah v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 111). However, in N.A. v. the United Kingdom the Court expressly considered its earlier decision in Vilvarajah v. the United Kingdom and concluded that it should not be interpreted so as to require an applicant to show the existence of special distinguishing features if he could otherwise show that the general situation of violence in the country of destination was of a sufficient level of intensity to create a real risk that any removal to that country would violate Article 3 of the Convention (N.A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 115 \u2013 116). To insist in such cases that the applicant show the existence of such special distinguishing features would render the protection offered by Article 3 illusory (N.A. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 116). Moreover, such a finding would call into question the absolute nature of Article 3, which prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n218. Therefore, following NA v. the United Kingdom, the sole question for the Court to consider in an expulsion case is whether, in all the circumstances of the case before it, substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if returned, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. If the existence of such a risk is established, the applicant\u2019s removal would necessarily breach Article 3, regardless of whether the risk emanates from a general situation of violence, a personal characteristic of the applicant, or a combination of the two. However, it is clear that not every situation of general violence will give rise to such a risk. On the contrary, the Court has made it clear that a general situation of violence would only be of sufficient intensity to create such a risk \u201cin the most extreme cases\u201d where there was a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (ibid., \u00a7 115).\n219. Accordingly, in the present case the Court must examine whether substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the applicants, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In doing so, it will first consider the general situation both in Mogadishu, which will be the point of their return, and in the remainder of southern and central Somalia before focusing on the foreseeable consequences of removal for each of the applicants. However, before it can begin its assessment of risk on return, it must address two preliminary issues which have arisen in the present case: first, the relationship between Article 3 of the Convention and article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, and secondly, the weight to be attached to country reports which primarily rely on information provided by anonymous sources.\n2. The relationship between Article 3 of the Convention and article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive\n(a) The parties\u2019 submissions\n220. The applicants suggested that article 15(c) was clearly intended to provide for situations falling short of the protection provided both by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive and Article 3 of the Convention. They therefore accepted that there might be some circumstances in which a serious threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence would not, without more, be sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. However, they submitted that in the context of their proposed removal, the threat presented was such that the threshold envisaged in NA v. the United Kingdom had been exceeded.\n221. The Government submitted that both the ECJ in Elgafaji and the Court of Appeal in QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department had correctly adopted the approach that article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive was distinct from Article 3 of the Convention and, as such, it enabled Member States of the European Union to offer protection to asylum seekers over and above the minimum standards imposed by Article 3.\n222. In particular, the Government submitted that this interpretation was consistent with the overall objective of the Qualification Directive, which was to set \u201cminimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted\u201d. As such, it combined the traditional criteria contained in the Geneva Convention with the concept of \u201csubsidiary protection status\u201d, which drew together the international obligation of Member States as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights with the broader humanitarian practices adopted by Member States towards individuals manifestly in need of protection who did not necessarily qualify under either Convention.\n223. The fact that the European Union had adopted a broader scope for subsidiary protection did not mean that the same should necessarily be transplanted into Article 3. That was not what was intended by the adoption of the Directive, which clearly chose a wider scope than that of the Convention. Rather, the Government submitted that the more broadly-based standard of protection adopted by the European Union might not be appropriate across the wider membership of the Council of Europe, particularly in the absence of the express agreement of the Contracting States.\n224. Allied to this, the Government submitted that the rigours of the Qualification Directive were mitigated by a number of exclusions set out in article 17 which were based on the conduct of the individual. However, if article 15(c) were to be subsumed into Article 3 of the Convention, these exclusions would not similarly be incorporated.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n225. In Elgafaji the ECJ held that article 15(c) would be violated where substantial grounds were shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subjected to a threat of serious harm. In order to demonstrate such a risk he was not required to adduce evidence that he would be specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances (Elgafaji, cited above, \u00a7 35). Nevertheless, the ECJ considered that such a situation would be \u201cexceptional\u201d and the more the applicant could show that he was specifically affected by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, the lower the level of indiscriminate violence required for him to be eligible for subsidiary protection (Elgafaji, cited above, \u00a7 39).\n226. The jurisdiction of this Court is limited to the interpretation of the Convention and it would not, therefore, be appropriate for it to express any views on the ambit or scope of article 15(c) of the Qualification Direction. However, based on the ECJ\u2019s interpretation in Elgafaji, the Court is not persuaded that Article 3 of the Convention, as interpreted in NA, does not offer comparable protection to that afforded under the Directive. In particular, it notes that the threshold set by both provisions may, in exceptional circumstances, be attained in consequence of a situation of general violence of such intensity that any person being returned to the region in question would be at risk simply on account of their presence there.\n3. The weight to be attached to the report of the fact-finding mission to Nairobi (see paragraph 80, above)\n(a) The parties\u2019 submissions\n227. The applicants submitted that following NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7\u00a7 118 \u2013 122, 17 July 2008, little or no weight should be attached to the report of the fact-finding mission as it did not visit Somalia, did not appear to contact anyone in Somalia, and the majority of \u201csources\u201d were anonymous, identified only as \u201can international NGO\u201d, \u201ca diplomatic source\u201d, or \u201csecurity advisors\u201d. No information was provided about the extent of the sources\u2019 presence in Somalia, their roles within their respective organisations, or the type of work (if any) that they carried out in Somalia. This was of particular concern on account of the fact that so few international NGOs and diplomatic missions had any presence in Somalia.\n228. In response, the Government submitted that such criticisms were misplaced and unjustified. Although they acknowledged that the mission did not travel to Somalia, they claimed that this was pursuant to advice provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which warned British nationals against travel to Somalia. The Mission went instead to Nairobi, which was the location of the African Headquarters of the United Nations, the location of the highest concentration of inter-governmental and\nnon-governmental organisations operating in and with daily contact to the situation in Somalia. In Nairobi, the Mission was able to interview a number of contacts who had recently returned to Nairobi from Somalia, some of whom had been in Somalia for a number of weeks in the period immediately preceding the mission.\n229. The Government further acknowledged that the majority of sources were not named in the report. However, they submitted that anonymity had been granted at the sources\u2019 request as they were concerned about the risk to their operations and staff and they asked the Court to take notice of the fact that the sources cited in the report by the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration were also anonymous.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n230. In assessing the weight to be attributed to country material, consideration must be given to its source, in particular its independence, reliability and objectivity. In respect of reports, the authority and reputation of the author, the seriousness of the investigations by means of which they were compiled, the consistency of their conclusions and their corroboration by other sources are all relevant considerations (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7 143, ECHR 2008\u2011... and NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 120).\n231. The Court also recognises that consideration must be given to the presence and reporting capacities of the author of the material in the country in question. In this respect, the Court observes that States (whether the respondent State in a particular case or any other Contracting or non-Contracting State), through their diplomatic missions and their ability to gather information, will often be able to provide material which may be highly relevant to the Court\u2019s assessment of the case before it. It finds that the same consideration must apply, a fortiori, in respect of agencies of the United Nations, particularly given their direct access to the authorities of the country of destination as well as their ability to carry out on-site inspections and assessments in a manner which States and non-governmental organisations may not be able to do.\n232. The Court appreciates the many difficulties faced by governments and NGOs gathering information in dangerous and volatile situations. It accepts that it will not always be possible for investigations to be carried out in the immediate vicinity of a conflict and, in such cases, information provided by sources with first-hand knowledge of the situation may have to be relied on. The Court will not, therefore, disregard a report simply on account of the fact that its author did not visit the area in question and instead relied on information provided by sources.\n233. That being said, where a report is wholly reliant on information provided by sources, the authority and reputation of those sources and the extent of their presence in the relevant area will be relevant factors for the Court in assessing the weight to be attributed to their evidence. The Court recognises that where there are legitimate security concerns, sources may wish to remain anonymous. However, in the absence of any information about the nature of the sources\u2019 operations in the relevant area, it will be virtually impossible for the Court to assess their reliability. Consequently, the approach taken by the Court will depend on the consistency of the sources\u2019 conclusions with the remainder of the available information. Where the sources\u2019 conclusions are consistent with other country information, their evidence may be of corroborative weight. However, the Court will generally exercise caution when considering reports from anonymous sources which are inconsistent with the remainder of the information before it.\n234. In the present case the Court observes that the description of the sources relied on by the fact-finding mission is vague. As indicated by the applicants, the majority of sources have simply been described either as \u201can international NGO\u201d, \u201ca diplomatic source\u201d, or \u201ca security advisor\u201d. Such descriptions give no indication of the authority or reputation of the sources or of the extent of their presence in southern and central Somalia. This is of particular concern in the present case, where it is accepted that the presence of international NGOs and diplomatic missions in southern and central Somalia is limited. It is therefore impossible for the Court to carry out any assessment of the sources\u2019 reliability and, as a consequence, where their information is unsupported or contradictory, the Court is unable to attach substantial weight to it.\n##### 4. The security situation in Mogadishu\n(a) The parties\u2019 submissions\n235. The applicants submitted that there had been increasing violence in Mogadishu following the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in January 2009. Human Rights Watch described how Mogadishu had been torn apart by \u201cindiscriminate warfare\u201d, while UNHCR reported that both al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam had been accused of using the civilian population as human shields. In 2010 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in AM (Somalia) held that the situation in Mogadishu was such that everyone except possibly prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs would be at risk if returned there (see paragraph 66, above). The background information post-dating AM (Somalia) showed that the situation had since deteriorated (see, for example, paragraphs 121, 123 and 127, above).\n236. The applicants submitted that the number of civilian casualties in Mogadishu had been immeasurable and the level of violence was only set to increase. They had obtained a witness statement from a Mr Kahiye Alim, a lawyer who had recently spoken with both General Ahmed Jumal Geedi, the Chief of Army Staff, and Mr Warsame Mohammed Hassan, the Second Deputy Mayor of Mogadishu. Mr Alim had been informed that with the assistance of the new Ugandan troops, the Transitional Federal Government, with the assistance of AMISOM, intended to go on the offensive and retake those parts of Mogadishu which were under the control of al-Shabaab. He had also been informed that following the attempted suicide bombings at Mogadishu International Airport on 9 September 2010, the airport had been subject to daily shelling and bombing.\n237. The applicants therefore submitted that the indiscriminate violence in Mogadishu was currently at such a level of intensity as to pose a risk to the life or person of any civilian in the capital.\n238. The Government submitted, with reference to the most recent country reports, that Mogadishu was by no means a \u201cno-go area\u201d. On the contrary, a number of sources interviewed by the fact-finding mission had emphasised that, despite the dangers, there was still a substantial degree of normality in Mogadishu and that the risk to civilians appeared to be from being caught up in the crossfire and not from being specifically targeted (see paragraph 87, above).\n239. The Government further argued that al-Shabaab had become more sophisticated under the influence of foreign jihadists and, as a consequence, the risks they posed to the general civilian populace appeared to have lessened. In particular, they referred to the report of the recent fact-finding mission, which indicated that al-Shabaab was now targeting its attacks specifically against Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM interests (see paragraph 83, above). The Government also referred to the report of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, which indicated that although conditions varied significantly across different areas of Mogadishu, in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab there were some positive signs, high levels of law and order (see paragraph 115, above).\n240. Consequently, the Government contended that there were no substantial grounds for believing that the applicants\u2019 removal to Mogadishu would give rise to a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n241. In the present case the applicants submitted that the indiscriminate violence in Mogadishu was of a sufficient level of intensity to pose a real risk to the life or person of any civilian in the capital. Although the Court has previously indicated that it would only be \u201cin the most extreme cases\u201d that a situation of general violence would be of sufficient intensity to pose such a risk, it has not provided any further guidance on how the intensity of a conflict is to be assessed. However, the Court recalls that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had to conduct a similar assessment in AM and AM (Somalia) (cited above), and in doing so it identified the following criteria: first, whether the parties to the conflict were either employing methods and tactics of warfare which increased the risk of civilian casualties or directly targeting civilians; secondly, whether the use of such methods and/or tactics was widespread among the parties to the conflict; thirdly, whether the fighting was localised or widespread; and finally, the number of civilians killed, injured and displaced as a result of the fighting. While these criteria are not to be seen as an exhaustive list to be applied in all future cases, in the context of the present case the Court considers that they form an appropriate yardstick by which to assess the level of violence in Mogadishu.\n242. It is not in dispute that towards the end of 2008 Mogadishu was not a safe place to live for the great majority of its citizens. In the most recent Country Guideline determination, AM and AM (Somalia) (cited above), the then Asylum and Immigration Tribunal carefully considered the intensity of the fighting, the security situation and the extent of the population displacement and concluded that the armed conflict in Mogadishu amounted to indiscriminate violence of such a level of severity as to place the majority of the population at risk of serious harm. However, it did not rule out that there might be certain individuals who on the facts might be considered to be able to live safely in the city, for example if they had close connections with powerful actors in Mogadishu, such as prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs.\n243. The objective information would appear to suggest that the situation in Mogadishu improved in 2009. The United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Operational Guidance Note of 1 July 2010 indicated that a fall in clashes between government troops and insurgents had led to a substantial drop in the numbers of civilians killed in fighting in Mogadishu in 2009 (see paragraph 99, above). This conclusion was offered some support by the report of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration Country of Origin Centre, which recorded that although the civilian population of Mogadishu was still the victim of indiscriminate violence, it was \u201cto a slightly lesser extent than previously\u201d (see paragraph 111, above).\n244. Nevertheless, the most recent reports indicate that all significant parties to the conflict have continued to engage in indiscriminate violence, conducting numerous mortar attacks against enemy forces in densely populated areas of Mogadishu without regard to the civilian population. Moreover, all parties have continued to use mortars without spotters or guidance systems, firing indiscriminately in the general direction of opposition fire or bombarding areas such as Bakara Market which were considered to be opposition strongholds (see paragraphs 82, 123, 127, 132, 137, 139-140 and 160, above).\n245. Furthermore, the reports indicate that the security situation in Mogadishu deteriorated in 2010. On 9 September 2010 the Secretary\u2011General of the United Nations reported that volatility and insecurity had increased in Mogadishu (see paragraph 123, above) and on 16 September 2010 Shamsul Bari, the Independent Expert, reported that at the time of drafting his report fighting had once again broken out in Mogadishu and hospitals were swamped with war-wounded (see paragraph 127, above). Estimates of civilian casualties and displaced persons vary from one report to another. The Secretary General reported that from 20 March 2010 to 11 July 2010 approximately 1,600 civilian casualties had been admitted to the two main hospitals in Mogadishu (see paragraph 123, above). In addition, 179,000 people had been displaced in Mogadishu during the first quarter of 2010 and a further 75,000 people had been displaced during the second quarter. The UNHCR reported that 20-50 civilians were dying each week in Mogadishu and that there had been over 900 civilian casualties in Mogadishu in March and April 2010 (see paragraph 132, above). Amnesty International\u2019s Briefing Paper of 18 October 2010 suggested that a further 230 civilians had been killed and 400 injured in fighting during the last week of August 2010 and the first week of September 2010 and that 42,400 people had been displaced from around and within Mogadishu since 23 August 2010 (see paragraphs 145 and 148, above). Meanwhile, the Independent Expert referred to statistics produced by the Elman Peace Centre of Somalia, which recorded that 918 civilians had died in the first seven months of 2010 and a further 2,555 were injured (see paragraph 127, above).\n246. Whatever the precise figures, it is clear that since the beginning of 2010 the ongoing fighting in Mogadishu has resulted in thousands of civilian casualties and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Although there were reports that al-Shabaab\u2019s tactics had become more sophisticated following the recruitment of foreign fighters, none of the reports suggested that the use of new tactics had in any way reduced the risk to civilians. On the contrary, one source told the fact-finding mission that the new tactics introduced by foreign fighters included random attacks on civilians (see paragraph 83, above). The report of the Norwegian Directorate also suggested that the professionalisation of al-Shabaab operations resulted in their being implemented with \u201cgreater brutality\u201d (see paragraph 112, above).\n247. The situation in Mogadishu has been described by the Norwegian Directorate as unpredictable, capable of changing on a daily basis (see paragraphs 110 and 118, above). While it would appear that at any given time the fighting is more intense in some areas than in others, the report of the Norwegian Directorate indicated that the power balance in districts and urban areas could change almost from day to day and, as a consequence, information on area control could become out of date very quickly (see paragraph 110, above). In particular, the report described how one area which had previously been considered safe was now \u201cshot to pieces\u201d and all its inhabitants had fled (see paragraph 118, above).\n248. The Court considers that the large quantity of objective information overwhelmingly indicates that the level of violence in Mogadishu is of sufficient intensity to pose a real risk of treatment reaching the Article 3 threshold to anyone in the capital. In reaching this conclusion the Court has had regard to the indiscriminate bombardments and military offensives carried out by all parties to the conflict, the unacceptable number of civilian casualties, the substantial number of persons displaced within and from the city, and the unpredictable and widespread nature of the conflict.\n249. The Court notes that in AM and AM (Somalia) the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal left open the possibility that certain individuals who were exceptionally well-connected to \u201cpowerful actors\u201d in Mogadishu might be able to obtain protection and live safely in the city. The Court has not received any submissions specifically addressed to this issue and observes that it is one on which the country reports have been largely silent. As Article 3 requires the decision-maker to focus on the foreseeable consequences of removal for each individual applicant, it would not exclude that it might be shown that a well-connected individual would be protected in Mogadishu. However, it considers it likely that this would be rare. First, in the light of the Tribunal decision it would appear that only connections at the highest level would be in a position to afford such protection. For example, it would not be enough to show that an individual was a member of a majority clan. Secondly, it recalls that in HH (Somalia) and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426 the Court of Appeal found that an applicant who had not been to Somalia for some time was unlikely to have the contacts necessary to afford him protection on return. It is therefore unlikely that a Contracting State could successfully raise such an argument unless the individual in question had recently been in Somalia.\n250. Consequently, the Court concludes that the violence in Mogadishu is of such a level of intensity that anyone in the city, except possibly those who are exceptionally well-connected to \u201cpowerful actors\u201d, would be at real risk of treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.\n##### 5. Conditions in southern and central Somalia (outside Mogadishu)\n(a) The parties\u2019 submissions\n251. The applicants submitted that it would be unrealistic for them to travel to another part of southern and central Somalia. The entry point to Somalia was Mogadishu International Airport and as a consequence of the intense level of violence prevalent in and around Mogadishu, travelling, or attempting to travel, from the airport to another part of southern and central Somalia would expose them to a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3.\n252. The applicants relied on the UNHCR Eligibility Guidelines, which did not consider that there was any internal flight or relocation alternative available inside southern and central Somalia. Throughout 2009 and 2010 there had been widespread violence throughout the region and UNHCR considered that there was substantial evidence of generalised violence resulting in indiscriminate harm (see paragraphs 132 - 134, above).\n253. In addition to the high levels of violence, there had also been a marked increase in detention, torture, unlawful killing and \u201cruthless attacks\u201d in both Mogadishu and elsewhere in southern and central Somalia. Amnesty International reported a worrying trend of individuals stoned to death, publicly shot dead, amputated and flogged on the orders of quasi-judicial bodies operated by local leaders linked to armed groups (see paragraphs 164 - 168, above).\n254. The applicants further submitted that if returned to Mogadishu there was at least a reasonable likelihood that they would be forced into IDP camps and the dire humanitarian conditions in these camps and makeshift settlements therefore had to be taken into account in assessing compliance with Article 3.\n255. As the IDP camps and settlements were virtually inescapable, the applicants argued that they were similar to detention camps and, as such, the Court should apply by analogy its jurisprudence on detention conditions. The applicants argued that the conditions in the camps and settlements resembled, but were very much worse than, conditions which the Court had found to violate Article 3 in respect of detainees (see, for example, Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, ECHR 2001\u2011II, Peers v. Greece, no. 28524/95, ECHR 2001\u2011III, S.D. v. Greece, no. 53541/07, 11 June 2009, Riad and Idiab v. Belgium, nos. 29787/03 and 29810/03, ECHR 2008\u2011... (extracts) and Al-Agha v. Romania, no. 40933/02, 12 January 2010). They lacked the basic necessities of life such as food, water and healthcare. The level of violence, including violence against women and children, meant that many lived in constant fear for their lives or physical safety. In addition, although 70 percent of people located in the central Somalia region were in need of humanitarian assistance, UNHCR and other NGOs experienced insuperable difficulties in accessing many key locations. The applicants therefore submitted that being forced to have recourse to these camps would engage the United Kingdom\u2019s responsibilities under Article 3 of the Convention.\n256. The Government submitted that outside Mogadishu, much of southern and central Somalia was controlled by al-Shabaab. Recent reports, including that of the fact-finding mission, indicated that these areas were more stable and that harvests had increased. The Government accepted that the increased stability has carried with it an increase in human rights abuses, apparently arising from the extreme nature of al-Shabaab\u2019s interpretation and application of Sharia law. However, they contended that civilians would be safe provided that they \u201cfollowed the rules\u201d.\n257. The Government observed that according to recent reports, the travel situation within Somalia had improved significantly since early 2009. Members of the diaspora flew to Mogadishu regularly, with an established route from Nairobi carrying thousands of passengers in the first eight months of 2010. From information provided to the fact-finding mission it appeared that although returning Somalis would usually have to make arrangements with family members to be met on their return, armed escorts were not necessarily needed. In fact, evidence suggested that Somali citizens could use taxis to travel from the airport to the city (see paragraphs 84 - 85, above).\n258. The Government submitted that security had also improved with regard to travel between the different regions of Somalia and the general impression was that the population could move freely in both Government controlled areas and areas controlled by other groups. Improved security was in part due to the removal of many roadblocks. Although checkpoints still operated, most of these were operated by al-Shabaab in order to check persons and goods and to ensure that its strict Islamic codes were being enforced. This, combined with the fact that al-Shabaab was reported to have largely eradicated crimes such as robbery, theft and banditry, had contributed to the reduction in the risks of travelling (see paragraph 90, above).\n259. Insofar as the applicants were relying on the \u201cdire\u201d humanitarian conditions in Somalia as creating the risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, the Government submitted that the principles established in N. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 26565/05, \u00a7\u00a7 42 \u2013 45, 27 May 2008 were applicable. Therefore, humanitarian conditions would only reach the threshold of Article 3 if the circumstances obtaining in the receiving State were \u201cvery exceptional\u201d, it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that the applicant would not have access to the basic necessities of life, and that these deficiencies would result in an immediate threat to life or the impossibility of maintaining human dignity.\n260. The Government accepted that the humanitarian situation in Somalia was undoubtedly grave. However, they believed that recent reporting highlighted more positive signs. For example, according to UNHCR statistics, there were considerably fewer people in the Afgooye Corridor than there had been previously and a well-informed international source had told the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration that the actual number might be even lower as there was evidence to suggest that the internal refugee figures were exaggerated.\n261. Indeed, the fact-finding mission had indicated that the Afgooye Corridor was taking on a more permanent character, with an increasing number of businesses operating in the area. One interviewee had recorded that satellite pictures showed evidence of settling, urbanisation and normal life (see paragraph 95, above). Away from the Afgooye Corridor, there were a limited number of IDP settlements as it was more common for displaced persons to find homes with relatives in other areas. In this regard, the clan system remained important as clan members were prepared to share resources as far as possible.\n262. The Government also noted that the recent reporting had consistently identified an increase in human rights abuses in areas controlled by al-Shabaab, based largely on that group\u2019s extreme interpretation and application of Sharia law. Women in particular were considered to be particularly at risk of human rights abuses, although there was also a significant risk to men and children of forced recruitment. However, the Government submitted that while the al-Shabaab regime was undoubtedly repressive, there was evidence to suggest that those who abided by their rules could live their day to day lives freely (see paragraph 92, above).\n263. The Government therefore submitted that the dire humanitarian conditions which the applicants might face on return to Somalia would not cross the \u201cvery exceptional\u201d threshold as they could show no more than a speculative risk, based on a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d.\n264. Consequently, the Government submitted that the level of risk likely to be faced by the applicants if they were to travel from Mogadishu into central or southern Somalia was not sufficient to constitute a breach of Article 3.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n\u03b1. The internal flight alternative\n265. The Court observes that in the present case the Government intends to return both applicants to Mogadishu. However, it cannot limit its consideration of the risk on return to an assessment of the conditions in Mogadishu as the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal found that despite the existence of a real risk of serious harm in the capital, it would be possible for the applicants to relocate to a safer region in southern or central Somalia.\n266. In the United Kingdom an application for asylum or for subsidiary protection will fail if the decision-maker considers that it would be reasonable \u2013 and not unduly harsh \u2013 to expect the applicant to relocate (Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49). The Court recalls that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight alternative in their assessment of an individual\u2019s claim that a return to his country of origin would expose him to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision (Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, no. 1948/04, \u00a7 141, ECHR 2007\u2011I (extracts), Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 98, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V and Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, \u00a7\u00a7 67 \u2013 68, ECHR 2001\u2011II). However, the Court has held that reliance on an internal flight alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 141 and T.I. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 43844/98, ECHR 2000-III). Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his ending up in a part of the country of origin where he may be subjected to ill-treatment (Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, cited above, \u00a7 141).\n267. Although it is clear that Somali nationals would not be able to gain admittance to Somaliland or Puntland unless they were born there or had strong clan connections to the region (see paragraphs 79 and 103, above), the Court is not aware of the existence of any similar obstacles which would prevent a Somali returnee from gaining admittance to another part of southern and central Somalia. However, in view of the humanitarian crisis and the strain that it has placed both on individuals and on the traditional clan structure, in practice the Court does not consider that a returnee could find refuge or support in an area where he has no close family connections (see paragraphs 114, 119 and 138, above). If a returnee either has no such connections or if he could not safely travel to an area where he has such connections, the Court considers it reasonably likely that he would have to seek refuge in an IDP settlement or refugee camp. Therefore, in considering the internal flight alternative, the Court will first consider whether a returnee would be exposed to a risk of ill-treatment either in transit or upon settling in another part of southern and central Somalia before considering whether he would be at risk of ill-treatment in an IDP or refugee camp on account of the humanitarian conditions there.\n\u03b2. The risk in transit or upon settling elsewhere in southern and central Somalia\n268. Although there are a number of airports in southern and central Somalia, all applicants facing removal from the United Kingdom have been issued with removal directions to Mogadishu International Airport. The airport is currently controlled by the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM and, as a consequence, it has been the subject of a number of attacks by al-Shabaab (see paragraphs 71 and 85, above). Nevertheless, the airport appears to be in regular use, with the EU Special Representative reporting that 15 - 18 flights were arriving every day (see paragraph 84, above). Consequently, the Court does not consider that there is a real risk that a person being returned to southern and central Somalia would be subjected to ill-treatment at the airport.\n269. Although the Court has found that Mogadishu is not a safe place for the majority of Somalis, it notes that a returnee could travel from Mogadishu International Airport to another part of southern and central Somalia without entering the city. However, the safety of this onward journey will vary from case to case depending on the returnee\u2019s destination.\n270. The country reports indicate that there has been fighting in the towns of Beletweyne, Kismayo, Dhusamareb, Afmadow, various towns in the Galgaduud region, the Gedo and Bakool regions, the Lower Juba region and Lower Shabelle (see paragraphs 100, 118, 121, 149, 161 and 179 above). Although there is little information available concerning the intensity of the fighting in these areas, it would appear that it is the conflict in Mogadishu which is primarily responsible for Somalia\u2019s civilian casualties and widespread displacement (see paragraphs 100, 109, 120, 123\u2011124, 132, 145, 159, 169 and 178, above). Moreover, the reports describe the fighting outside Mogadishu as sporadic and localised around key strategic towns (see paragraphs 120 and 161, above). Consequently, while there is fighting in some areas, other areas have remained comparatively stable (see paragraphs 92, 120, 144 and 159, above).\n271. The Court is therefore prepared to accept that it might be possible for a returnee to travel from Mogadishu International Airport to another part of southern and central Somalia without being exposed to a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 solely on account of the situation of general violence. However, this will very much depend upon where a returnee\u2019s home area is. It is not possible for the Court to assess the level of general violence in every part of southern and central Somalia and, even if it were to undertake such an exercise, it is likely that its conclusions would become outdated very quickly. Consequently, if the applicant\u2019s home is one which has been affected by the conflict, the conditions there will have to be assessed against the requirements of Article 3 at the time of removal.\n272. The Court observes that the situation of general violence is not the only risk that a returnee might have to face if he were to relocate to another part of southern and central Somalia. According to the country reports, the areas with the lowest levels of generalised violence are the areas under the control of al-Shabaab (see paragraphs 92 and 159, above), which are also the areas reported to have the worst human rights conditions (see paragraphs 94, 104, 128 and164-168, above). Consequently, even if a returnee could travel to and settle in his home area without being exposed to a real risk of ill-treatment on account of the situation of general violence, he might still be exposed to a real risk of ill-treatment on account of the human rights situation.\n273. It is clear that in the areas under their control al-Shabaab is enforcing a particularly draconian version of Sharia law which goes well beyond the traditional interpretation of Islam in Somalia (see paragraphs 94 and 164, above) and in fact amounts to \u201ca repressive form of social control\u201d (see paragraph 164, above). The reports indicate that al-Shabaab are concerned with every little detail of daily life, including men\u2019s and women\u2019s style of dress, the length of men\u2019s beards, the style of music being listened to and the choice of mobile phone ringtone (see paragraphs 164 \u2013 165, above). Women appear to be particularly targeted. In addition to strict dress codes, women in al-Shabaab controlled areas are not permitted to go out in public with men, even with male relatives, and have been ordered to close their shops as commercial activity permitted them to \u201cmix with men\u201d (see paragraphs 104 and 166 \u2013 167, above). There were also reports of \u201csystematic\u201d forced recruitment by al-Shabaab of both adults and children in the areas under its control (see paragraphs 91, 93, 126 and 163, above).\n274. Al-Shabaab\u2019s strict interpretation of Sharia law does not apply only to those living in areas under its control, but also to those travelling through these areas. According to the country reports, al-Shabaab has established checkpoints at the exit/entry routes to towns under its control, where goods and people are searched to ensure that its strict Islamic codes are complied with (see paragraphs 87, 90 and 101 above). Persons not obeying al-Shabaab\u2019s rules could experience difficulties at these checkpoints. For example, there were reports of women being flogged at checkpoints because they had been sitting beside a man in a vehicle (see paragraph 167, above). Moreover, there were also reports of young men and children being forcibly recruited at checkpoints (see paragraphs 91, above).\n275. In spite of the repressive regime in place, a number of sources told the fact-finding mission that areas controlled by al-Shabaab were generally safe for Somalis provided that they were able to \u201cplay the game\u201d and avoid the attention of al-Shabaab by obeying their rules (see paragraph 92, above). However, as al-Shabaab only began seizing parts of southern and central Somalia following the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts in late 2006, the Court considers it unlikely that a Somali with no recent experience of living in Somalia would be adequately equipped to \u201cplay the game\u201d, with the risk that he would come to the attention of al-Shabaab, either while travelling through or having settled in an al-Shabaab controlled area. The Court considers that this risk would be even greater for Somalis who have been out of the country long enough to become \u201cwesternised\u201d as certain attributes, such as a foreign accent, would be impossible to disguise.\n276. It is not possible to predict with any certainty the fate of a returnee who came to the attention of al-Shabaab for failing to comply with their rules. The reports suggest that punishments inflicted by al-Shabaab can include stoning, amputation, flogging and corporal punishment (see paragraphs 104 and 164 \u2013 168, above), all of which would attain the minimum level of severity required to fall within the scope of Article 3 (see, for example, Jabari v. Turkey, no. 40035/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000\u2011VII and A. v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 22, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VI). The Court accepts that in all likelihood, the punishment would depend on the gravity of the infringement but the Court cannot ignore reports that Somalis have been beaten or flogged for relatively minor infringements, such as playing scrabble (see paragraph 164, above), watching World Cup matches (see paragraph 164, above), and wearing \u201cinappropriate\u201d clothing (see paragraphs 165 \u2013 166, above).\n277. Consequently, the Court considers that a returnee with no recent experience of living in Somalia would be at real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 in an al-Shabaab controlled area. Accordingly, if a returnee\u2019s home area is in an al-Shabaab controlled area, or if it could not be reached without travelling through an al-Shabaab controlled area, the Court does not consider that he could relocate within Somalia without being exposed to a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment.\n\u03b3. Humanitarian conditions in refugee and IDP camps\n278. In Salah Sheekh v. the Netherlands, cited above, the Court held that socio-economic and humanitarian conditions in a country of return did not necessarily have a bearing, and certainly not a decisive bearing, on the question whether the persons concerned would face a real risk of\nill-treatment within the meaning of Article 3 in those areas (\u00a7 141). However, in N. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, the Court held that although the Convention was essentially directed at the protection of civil and political rights, the fundamental importance of Article 3 meant that it was necessary for the Court to retain a degree of flexibility to prevent expulsion in very exceptional cases. It therefore held that humanitarian conditions would give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention in very exceptional cases where the humanitarian grounds against removal were \u201ccompelling\u201d (\u00a7 42).\n279. In the recent case of M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece [GC], no. 30696/09, 21 January 2011, the Court stated that it had not excluded the possibility that the responsibility of the State under Article 3 might be engaged in respect of treatment where an applicant, who was wholly dependent on State support, found himself faced with official indifference in a situation of serious deprivation or want incompatible with human dignity (\u00a7 253). In that case, the applicant had spent months living in a state of the most extreme poverty, unable to cater for his most basic needs: food, hygiene and a place to live. Added to that, the Court noted the applicant\u2019s ever-present fear of being attacked and robbed and the total lack of any likelihood of his situation improving (\u00a7 254). It held that the conditions in which the applicant was living reached the Article 3 threshold and found Greece in breach of that Article as it was the State directly responsible for the applicant\u2019s living conditions (\u00a7 264). It also found Belgium to be in breach of Article 3 because, inter alia, it had transferred the applicant to Greece and thus knowingly exposed him to living conditions which amounted to degrading treatment (\u00a7 367).\n280. In the present case the Government submitted, albeit prior to the publication of the Court\u2019s decision in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, that the appropriate test for assessing whether dire humanitarian conditions reached the Article 3 threshold was that set out in N. v. the United Kingdom. Humanitarian conditions would therefore only reach the Article 3 threshold in very exceptional cases where the grounds against removal were \u201ccompelling\u201d.\n281. The Court recalls that N. v. the United Kingdom concerned the removal of an HIV-positive applicant to Uganda, where her lifespan was likely to be reduced on account of the fact that the treatment facilities there were inferior to those available in the United Kingdom. In reaching its conclusions, the Court noted that the alleged future harm would emanate not from the intentional acts or omission of public authorities or non-State bodies but from a naturally occurring illness and the lack of sufficient resources to deal with it in the receiving country. The Court therefore relied on the fact that neither the applicant\u2019s illness nor the inferior medical facilities were caused by any act or omission of the receiving State or of any non-State actors within the receiving State.\n282. If the dire humanitarian conditions in Somalia were solely or even predominantly attributable to poverty or to the State\u2019s lack of resources to deal with a naturally occurring phenomenon, such as a drought, the test in N. v. the United Kingdom may well have been considered to be the appropriate one. However, it is clear that while drought has contributed to the humanitarian crisis, that crisis is predominantly due to the direct and indirect actions of the parties to the conflict. The reports indicate that all parties to the conflict have employed indiscriminate methods of warfare in densely populated urban areas with no regard to the safety of the civilian population (see paragraphs 82, 123, 127, 132, 137, 139-140 and 160, above). This fact alone has resulted in widespread displacement and the breakdown of social, political and economic infrastructures. Moreover, the situation has been greatly exacerbated by al-Shabaab\u2019s refusal to permit international aid agencies to operate in the areas under its control, despite the fact that between a third and a half of all Somalis are living in a situation of serious deprivation (see paragraphs 125, 131, 169, 187 and 193, above).\n283. Consequently, the Court does not consider the approach adopted in N. v. the United Kingdom to be appropriate in the circumstances of the present case. Rather, it prefers the approach adopted in M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, which requires it to have regard to an applicant\u2019s ability to cater for his most basic needs, such as food, hygiene and shelter, his vulnerability to ill-treatment and the prospect of his situation improving within a reasonable time-frame (see M.S.S. v. Belgium and Greece, cited above, \u00a7 254).\n284. The reports indicate that the conditions for internally displaced persons in southern and central Somalia are dire. Prior to the recent failure of the rains, the reports indicated that over half of Somalia\u2019s population was dependent on food aid, and many of those people lived in the areas from which the WFP had withdrawn (see paragraph 169, above). Two million people, representing more than a quarter of the population of Somalia, faced a humanitarian crisis (see paragraph 131, above). The United Nations estimated that that figure had already risen to 2.4 million, nearly a third of the population of Somalia, and that the situation would only deteriorate further if the rains continued to fail (see paragraphs 193 and 194, above). However, despite the humanitarian crisis, al-Shabaab continues to deny international NGOs access to areas under its control (see paragraphs 94, 105, 117, 122, 141-142, 162, 169-170, 181-182 and 186, above).\n285. The largest concentration of IDPs is in the Afgooye Corridor. It is impossible to state with any degree of accuracy how many IDPs currently live there, but the most recent estimates indicate that it may be as many as 410,000 people. It is exceptionally difficult for aid agencies to access the corridor (see paragraphs 95, 122 and 143, above) and recent reports suggest that IDPs are being forced to return to Mogadishu in search of food and water (see paragraph 193, above). IDPs in the camps also appear to be extremely vulnerable to exploitation and crime. Both adults and children displaced in the Afgooye Corridor are being forcibly recruited to fight for al-Shabaab (see paragraph 93, above) and there is a high prevalence of sexual violence in the area (see paragraph 129, above).\n286. The Government submitted that there is evidence of increased urbanisation of the Afgooye Corridor. Although this assertion is supported by a number of the country reports, it is not clear to the Court whether or not urbanisation has improved conditions for the majority of IDPs. In fact, some reports suggest that IDPs are experiencing increasing difficulties in finding shelter in the Afgooye Corridor as landlords are either selling land that IDPs live on or are charging rent that they cannot afford (see paragraphs 95 and 189, above).\n287. Unlike those in the Afgooye Corridor, NGOs have access to the Dadaab camps in Kenya and both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have published detailed reports documenting the conditions there. Both organisations reported the difficulties experienced by refugees in reaching these camps following the closure of the Kenyan border (see paragraphs 152, 171-174, above). In particular, there are numerous reports of refugees being arbitrarily detained and/or abused by Kenyan police officers (see paragraphs 153, 154 and 171-173, above), preyed upon by criminal gangs (see paragraph 174, above), and in some cases being returned to Somalia unless they agreed to pay a bribe (see paragraphs 153, 171 and 173, above).\n288. Although UNHCR have a presence in the camps and humanitarian assistance is available, the reports indicate that the camps are severely overcrowded. The camps initially were intended to hold approximately 90,000 refugees but the most recent reports indicate that approximately 280,000 registered refugees are now living there (see paragraph 155, above). As a result of the overcrowding, new refugees cannot build shelters and instead have to stay with relatives and/or clan members (see paragraph 155, above). In addition, many refugees complain that the allocation of water is insufficient as the water infrastructure was only designed for one third of the number of people currently living in the camps (see paragraph 155, above).\n289. There were also reports of insecurity within the camps, with high levels of theft and sexual violence. This appeared to be in part due to a minimal police presence (see paragraph 176, above) and in part due to police inaction when confronted with reports of crime or sexual violence (see paragraph 176, above). In addition, there were reports that the Kenyan authorities had been taking advantage of vulnerable refugees by recruiting them to fight for the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia (see paragraph 157, above).\n290. Both the report of Amnesty International and that of Human Rights Watch indicated that refugees were not permitted to leave the camps, except in exceptional circumstances, and refugees found outside the camps without \u201cmovement passes\u201d were arrested, fined and imprisoned for months at a time (see paragraphs 158 and 177, above).\n291. In light of the above, the Court considers that the conditions both in the Afgooye Corridor and in the Dadaab camps are sufficiently dire to amount to treatment reaching the threshold of Article 3 of the Convention. IDPs in the Afgooye Corridor have very limited access to food and water, and shelter appears to be an emerging problem as landlords seek to exploit their predicament for profit. Although humanitarian assistance is available in the Dadaab camps, due to extreme overcrowding access to shelter, water and sanitation facilities is extremely limited. The inhabitants of both camps are vulnerable to violent crime, exploitation, abuse and forcible recruitment. Moreover, the refugees living in \u2013 or, indeed, trying to get to \u2013 the Dadaab camps are also at real risk of refoulement by the Kenyan authorities. Finally, the Court notes that the inhabitants of both camps have very little prospect of their situation improving within a reasonable timeframe. The refugees in the Dadaab camps are not permitted to leave and would therefore appear to be trapped in the camps until the conflict in Somalia comes to an end. In the meantime, the camps are becoming increasingly overcrowded as refugees continue to flee the situation in Somalia. Although the IDPs in the Afgooye Corridor are permitted to leave, in reality the only place they are able to return to is Mogadishu, which the Court has found not to be a safe place for the vast majority of civilians. Consequently, there is also little prospect of their situation improving while the conflict continues.\n292. Accordingly, the Court finds that any returnee forced to seek refuge in either camp would be at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment on account of the dire humanitarian conditions. Although there is little information regarding the situation in other IDP settlements in Somalia, from the information that is available the Court sees little reason to believe that the conditions there would be any better than those in the Afgooye Corridor or in the Dadaab camps. If anything, the situation in those settlements is likely to be worse as there has been less publicity concerning the plight of their inhabitants and there is therefore even less chance that they might receive humanitarian assistance.\n##### 6. Summary of the Court\u2019s conclusions\n293. In conclusion, the Court considers that the situation of general violence in Mogadishu is sufficiently intense to enable it to conclude that any returnee would be at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment solely on account of his presence there, unless it could be demonstrated that he was sufficiently well connected to powerful actors in the city to enable him to obtain protection (see paragraph 249, above).\n294. Nevertheless, Article 3 does not preclude the Contracting States from placing reliance on the internal flight alternative provided that the returnee could travel to, gain admittance to and settle in the area in question without being exposed to a real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment. In this regard, the Court accepts that there may be parts of southern and central Somalia where a returnee would not necessarily be at real risk of Article 3\nill-treatment solely on account of the situation of general violence (see paragraph 270, above). However, in the context of Somalia, the Court considers that this could only apply if the applicant had close family connections in the area concerned, where he could effectively seek refuge. If he has no such connections, or if those connections are in an area which he could not safely reach, the Court considers that there is a likelihood that he would have to have recourse to either an IDP or refugee camp (see paragraph 266, above).\n295. If the returnee\u2019s family connections are in a region which is under the control of al-Shabaab, or if it could not be accessed except through an al-Shabaab controlled area, the Court does not consider that he could relocate to this region without being exposed to a risk of ill-treatment unless it could be demonstrated that he had recent experience of living in Somalia and could therefore avoid coming to the attention of al-Shabaab (see paragraph 276, above).\n296. Where it is reasonably likely that a returnee would find himself in an IDP camp, such as those in the Afgooye Corridor, or in a refugee camp, such as the Dadaab camps in Kenya, the Court considers that there would be a real risk that he would be exposed to treatment in breach of Article 3 on account of the humanitarian conditions there (see paragraph 295, above).\n##### 7. Application of the aforementioned principles to the applicants\u2019 cases\n(a) The first applicant\n\u03b1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n297. The first applicant submitted that he was at an enhanced risk of torture and ill-treatment over and above that which arose solely from being returned to Somalia on account of the fact that he was from a minority clan, the Reer Hamar. He relied on the report of Dr Virginia Luling, prepared in 2007 in the course of the domestic proceedings, which concluded that, as claimed, he belonged to the Benadiri Shanshiya (a sub-clan of the Reer Hamar) on the basis of his knowledge of that clan, his dialect, his appearance and on the basis of information provided by a third party concerning the identity of his father. As a member of a minority clan whose family had either fled persecution or been killed, he would be unable to obtain any clan protection in Somalia. Moreover, as he had claimed asylum in the United Kingdom at the age of sixteen, and had not lived in Somalia for over seven years, he would be seen as a westernised outsider.\n298. The first applicant further submitted that he would be unable to cope on return as he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). He submitted a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Paul Monks, a Consultant General and Forensic Psychiatrist, on 18 August 2008. Dr Monks was of the opinion that the first applicant suffered PTSD which was caused by witnessing the rape of his mother and the murder of his father and sister at the hands of militia. His symptoms included evolving depressive symptoms which were exacerbated by his imprisonment and the uncertainty surrounding his future. His psychiatric problems had resulted in repeated self-harm and suicidal acts, although it was noted that his PTSD symptoms appeared to be partially resolving.\n299. The Government did not accept that the first applicant had conclusively demonstrated that he was a member of a minority clan. Dr Luling had interviewed the applicant in August 2007, nearly four years after his arrival in the United Kingdom and some two years after the Adjudicator had rejected his claim that he was a member of the Reer Hamar. The Government therefore submitted that he had had an opportunity to carry out basic research into the Reer Hamar in the period before his interview and the answers relied on by Dr Luling as demonstrating knowledge of the sub-clan was all based on information which would have been in the public domain. With regard to the first applicant\u2019s dialect, Dr Luling did not explain on what basis the interpreter was qualified to carry out an assessment of the language used and she did not consider alternative explanations for the mixture of Reer Hamar and general dialect allegedly spoken by him. In particular, the Government relied on the report of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration, which noted that other Somalis growing up and living in the same neighbourhood as the Reer Hamar probably also know and speak the Hamar dialect.\n300. The Government also noted that the first applicant purported to originate from Qoryoley, a small town to the south of Mogadishu in an area currently controlled by al-Shabaab. In light of this and all the other recent information, the Government submitted that the level of risk likely to be faced by him if he were to travel from Mogadishu into central or southern Somalia, and in particular to his home town, was not sufficient to constitute a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n\u03b2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n301. In view of its findings at paragraph 249, above, the Court finds that if the first applicant were to remain in Mogadishu, there would be a real risk that he would be subjected to Article 3 ill-treatment.\n302. As the first applicant originates from Qoryoley, the Court accepts that he might have close family who could support him there. However, the town is currently under the control of al-Shabaab and, as the first applicant arrived in the United Kingdom in 2003, when he was only sixteen years old, the Court considers that there is a real risk he would be subjected to Article 3 ill-treatment by al-Shabaab if he were to attempt to relocate there.\n303. The evidence submitted to the Court does not suggest that he has family elsewhere in southern and central Somalia. Consequently, as he could not safely travel to Qoryoley, it is likely that he would find himself in an IDP settlement such as the Afgooye Corridor or in a refugee camp such as the Dadaab camps. The Court has already found that the conditions in these camps are sufficiently dire to reach the Article 3 threshold and it notes that the first applicant would be particularly vulnerable on account of his psychiatric illness.\n304. The Court therefore concludes that the removal of the first applicant to Mogadishu would violate his rights under Article 3 of the Convention.\n(b) The second applicant\n\u03b1 The parties\u2019 submissions\n305. The second applicant submitted that he would be at increased risk in areas controlled by al-Shabaab because he would be seen as westernised and therefore anti-Islamic. He had arrived in the United Kingdom as a young man and had spent his entire adult life there. He wore an earring, which might lead to the perception that he was gay, he spoke little or no Somali and he had a thoroughly \u201cLondon\u201d accent. Moreover, if it was discovered that he had been a drug addict or thief then he would be liable to double amputations or being publicly flogged or killed.\n306. Even though he was from a majority clan, the applicant would be unable to obtain protection as clan structures were breaking down and in any case he no longer had any links to his clan. In addition, it was likely that he would be conscripted to fight for al-Shabaab.\n307. The Government submitted that as the second applicant was a member of the Isaaq clan it was likely that, if returned to Mogadishu, he would be able to make contact with, and receive assistance from, other members of his clan. Although it was not clear whether the system of clan protection was as strong in Mogadishu as it had been traditionally, it was still a factor which could reduce further any potential risks to the second applicant arising from the general security situation.\n308. Moreover, the Government submitted that even if the second applicant would face a real risk of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if returned to Mogadishu, he was unlikely to face a similar level of risk if he were to be returned to Hargeisa, the place of his birth. In this regard, the Government noted that the Operational Guidance Note of July 2010 indicated that people could travel by air between Mogadishu and Hargeisa.\n\u03b2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n309. In light of the Court\u2019s findings at paragraph 249 above, it considers that the second applicant would be at real risk of ill-treatment if he were to remain in the city of Mogadishu. Although it was accepted that he was a member of the majority Isaaq clan, the Court does not consider this to be evidence of sufficiently powerful connections which could protect him in Mogadishu.\n310. It does not consider that he would be able to relocate safely within southern and central Somalia. There is no evidence to suggest that he has any close family connections in the region and, in any case, he arrived in the United Kingdom in 1988, when he was nineteen years old. He has therefore spent the last 22 years in the United Kingdom and, like the first applicant, he has no experience of living under al-Shabaab\u2019s repressive regime. Consequently, the Court considers that he would be at real risk of Article 3 ill-treatment were he to seek refuge in an area under al-Shabaab\u2019s control. Likewise, there would be a real risk he would be subjected to Article 3\nill-treatment if he were to seek refuge either in the Afgooye Corridor or in the Dadaab camps.\n311. The Court recalls, however, that the second applicant was born in Somaliland and has accepted that he is a member of the Isaaq clan. The country information indicates that persons who originate from Somaliland and/or have strong clan connections to the region, such as members of the Isaaq clan, would be permitted to return there (see paragraphs 79 and 103, above). Nevertheless, if the second applicant could be admitted to Somaliland, it is not clear to the Court why he was issued with removal directions to Mogadishu rather than Hargeisa, where those originating from Somaliland have in the past been directly returned. The fact that they have chosen not to do so appears to contradict their assertion that he would be admitted there.\n312. Accordingly, the Court is not satisfied that the second applicant could travel to Hargeisa, gain admittance and settle there. It therefore concludes that the removal of the second applicant to Mogadishu would also violate Article 3 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n313. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n314. The applicants made no claim in respect of pecuniary and\nnon-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n315. The first and second applicants initially claimed GBP 14,539.99 and GBP 4074.44 respectively for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court. However, both claims were submitted to the Court out of time. The applicants subsequently jointly claimed GBP 4545 in respect of the supplementary observations submitted to the Court in October 2010.\n316. The Government submitted that the first applicant\u2019s claim for GBP 14,539.99 was excessive, even allowing for the fact that the case was a lead judgment on returns to Mogadishu.\n317. In the circumstances of the present case, the Court has decided to exercise its discretion to admit the applicants\u2019 claims for just satisfaction.\n318. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the first applicant the sum of EUR 14,500 for the proceedings before the Court and the second applicant the sum of EUR 7,500 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n319. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n### III. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT\n320. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.\n321. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see above \u00a7 4) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Panel of the Grand Chamber of the Court accepts any request by one or both of the parties to refer the case to the Grand Chamber under Article 43 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Decides to join the applications;\n##### 2. Declares the applications under Article 3 of the Convention admissible;\n3. Holds that the applicants\u2019 removal to Somalia would violate Article 3 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the first applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 14,500 (fourteen thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into British pounds at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that the respondent State is to pay the second applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into British pounds at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(c) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 28 June 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFato\u015f Arac\u0131 Lech Garlicki Deputy Registrar President\nMap provided by the Cartographic Section of the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations and Field Support in UNHQ", "001-91088": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BOOTH v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n7. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n8. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. The Government\u2019s preliminary objection\n9. The Government submitted that since the applicant\u2019s first letter to the Court had not been in accordance with Rule 47 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the application had been lodged more than six months from the date on which the final decision was taken and should therefore be declared inadmissible.\n10. The Court recalls that in accordance with Rule 47 \u00a7 5 of the Rules of Court, the date of introduction of the application is as a general rule considered to be the date of the first communication from the applicant setting out, even summarily, the object of the application (see Calleja v. Malta, (dec.), no. 75274/01, 18 March 2004).\n11. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s representative lodged a number of applications with the Court regarding complaints related to the various types of widow\u2019s benefits and therefore the same subject matter. In his covering letter, the applicant\u2019s representative described these cases as a \u201cgroup application for widowers seeking equal entitlement to State bereavement benefits\u201d. Although he did not individualise the nature of the complaints of each applicant, it was clear for the Court that they all wished to contest their non-entitlement under Articles 8, 14 and 1 of Protocol No. 1. The representative subsequently submitted follow-up schedules including, on 25 October 2001, a schedule giving details of the applicant in the instant case. The Court took as the date of introduction of each application the date on which the relevant schedule relating to a particular applicant was submitted.\nThe Court further notes that following a decision of 17 December 2002 taken by a Committee declaring the applicant\u2019s case inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month rule, the case was reopened in view of the discovery of the schedule relating to the applicant.\nThe Court therefore considers that, in the circumstances of the present case and as accepted in all grouped widowers\u2019 cases filed by the applicant\u2019s legal representative, the schedules as so submitted suffice to be regarded as the applicant\u2019s first letter for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n12. Consequently, since the applicant\u2019s first letter is dated 25 October 2001 and the final decision in his case is dated 31 May 2001, the application has not been lodged outside the six-month period. The Government\u2019s objection is therefore dismissed.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n13. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n14. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n15. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to Wpt, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n16. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n17. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to Wpt, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n#### C. Widow\u2019s Pension\nAdmissibility\n18. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n19. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n21. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s requests dated 12 August 2008 and 16 October 2008, the applicant\u2019s representatives did not submit a claim under Article 41 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to declare admissible the complaint relating to the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and inadmissible the remainder of the application;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 February 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-91092": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF MITCHARD v.

The Government\u2019s preliminary objection\n9. The Government submitted that since the applicant\u2019s first letter to the Court had not been in accordance with Rule 47 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, the application had been lodged more than six months from the date on which the final decision was taken and should therefore be declared inadmissible.\n10. The Court recalls that in accordance with Rule 47 \u00a7 5 of the Rules of Court, the date of introduction of the application is as a general rule considered to be the date of the first communication from the applicant setting out, even summarily, the object of the application (see Calleja v.

The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s representative lodged a number of cases with the Court regarding complaints relating to the various types of widow\u2019s benefits and therefore the same subject matter. In his covering letter, the applicant\u2019s representative described these cases as a \u201cgroup application for widowers seeking equal entitlement to State bereavement benefits\u201d. Although he did not individualise the nature of the complaints of each applicant, it was clear for the Court that they all wished to contest their non-entitlement under Articles 8, 14 and 1 of Protocol No. 1. The representative subsequently submitted follow-up schedules including, on 1 March 2001, a schedule giving details of the applicant in the instant case. The Court took as the date of introduction of each application the date on which the relevant schedule relating to a particular applicant was submitted. The Court therefore considers that, in the circumstances of the present case and as accepted in all grouped widowers\u2019 cases filed by the applicant\u2019s legal representative, the schedules as submitted suffice to be considered as the applicant\u2019s first letter for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n12. Consequently, since the applicant\u2019s first letter is dated 1 March 2001 and the final decision in his case is dated 10 October 2000, the application has not been lodged outside the six-month period. The Government\u2019s objection is therefore dismissed.\n#### B. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n13.

The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n15. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WMA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n16. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n17. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n#### C. Widow\u2019s Pension\nAdmissibility\n18. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n19. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n21. Notwithstanding the Court\u2019s requests dated 26 September 2008, 29 September 2008 and 16 October 2008, the applicant\u2019s representatives did not submit a claim under Article 41 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to declare admissible the complaint relating to the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance and inadmissible the remainder of the application;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 February 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-92425": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BLACKGROVE v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt and WMA constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n12. The Court recalls that a widow was not automatically entitled to survivors\u2019 benefits, but had to claim them from the relevant authority. Various time-limits applied: after 1997, a widow had to make a claim for Wpt within three months of her husband\u2019s death.\n13. The Court considers, as it held in Cornwell v. the United Kingdom (no. 36578/97, (dec.), 11 May 1999) that unless or until a man has made a claim to the domestic authorities for bereavement benefits, he cannot be regarded as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged discrimination involved in the refusal to pay such benefits, because a woman in the same position would not automatically be entitled to widows\u2019 benefits until she had made a claim (see also White v. the United Kingdom, no. 53134/99 (dec.), 7 June 2001, where the Court clarified that, as long as an applicant had made clear to the authorities his intention to claim benefits, the precise form in which he did so was not important). Similarly, a man who failed to apply within the time-limits as they applied to a woman claimant could not, in most cases, claim to be a victim of discrimination, since a woman in the same position would not have been entitled to the benefit in question (see Rogan v. the United Kingdom, no. 57946/00, (dec.), 8 September 2001).\n14. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s claim for Wpt made in 2000 had been made out of time. Thus, the applicant cannot claim to have been a victim of a violation of his rights under the Convention and Protocol No. 1.\n15. Accordingly, this part of the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and must be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n17. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n18. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WMA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n19. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n20. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n#### C. Widow\u2019s Pension\n##### 1. Admissibility\n21. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n22. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n24. In respect of damage the applicant claimed a total of 98,000 British pounds sterling (GBP):\n(i) GBP 48,000 for Widow\u2019s benefits to date;\n(ii) GBP 50,000 for health problems suffered since pursuing this case and loss if employment income.\n25. The Government submitted that WMA ceased to exist as from 9 April 2001. It followed that had the applicant been a woman, he would only have been entitled to WMA for the period from 5 October 2000 to 9 April 2001. The sum that would be due for that period would have been GBP 3,565.77 together with interest of GBP 1.226.01 as calculated according to established principles. The Government could not accept that the loss of a relatively small sum of money for such a relatively short period of time was the cause of the health problems suffered by the applicant. Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s case-law an award of non pecuniary damage was not generally made in cases were the breach arose from a failure to pay money, except where there were serious aggravating circumstances which were not present in the instant case.\n26. The Court notes that it has only found a violation in respect of WMA. The interest rate applicable has already been determined by the Court in the case of Runkee and White (cited above, \u00a7 52). In these circumstances, the Court awards compensation to the applicant of 5,185 euros (EUR) in respect of the refusal to grant him WMA up to 9 April 2001 as well as interest on that sum. The Court does not find it established that the applicant was caused real and serious health or emotional damage as a result of being denied the benefit in question and therefore makes no award in respect of those claims.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n27. The applicant claimed GBP 350 in costs for pursuing his claim before the domestic jurisdictions and this Court, including GBP 200 for costs incurred before the Court of Appeal.\n28. The Government contested the claim, stating that it mainly referred to domestic proceedings before the Court of Appeal which, in the applicant\u2019s case, did not have to be taken in order to exhaust domestic remedies. Moreover, the bills submitted were dated 2007 and therefore could not have been incurred in connection with the application to the Court.\n29. The Court considers that notwithstanding the allegedly poor prospects of success, the applicant cannot be reproached for having taken his claim to the Court of Appeal. As to the costs incurred in relation to the proceedings in Strasbourg, the Court notes that the proceedings started in 2006. Thus, it finds no reason to doubt that the applicant\u2019s bills dated 2007, which are not excessive, have been incurred for the purposes of the Convention proceedings. It therefore considers it appropriate to award the applicant EUR 370 under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to declare admissible the complaint relating to the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance and inadmissible the remainder of the application;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n3. Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention as concerns the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to a Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance.\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 5,185 (five thousand one hundred and eight-five euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 370 (three hundred and seventy euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 28 April 2009, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-61332": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF VON B\u00dcLOW v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 6 May and 16 September 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of other serious offences (e.g. manslaughter or rape) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside.\n#### B. Tariffs\n13. Over the years, the Secretary of State has adopted a \u201ctariff\u201d policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 505-507). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The \u201ctariff\u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Secretary of State will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Ex parte V. and T., [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp. 492G-493A).\n14. Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After expiry of the tariff, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board which has the power to order release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public.\n15. A different regime, however, applies under the 1991 Act to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. In relation to these prisoners, the Secretary of State decides the length of the tariff. The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial, as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531; and see the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard\u2019s, policy statement to Parliament, 27 July 1993, Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 861-864).\n#### C. Release on licence of mandatory life sentence prisoners\n16. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in section 35(2):\n\u201cIf recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.\u201d\n17. On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence, the Secretary of State\n\u201c... will consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.\u201d\n18. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (\u201cthe tariff\u201d) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner\u2019s risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see e.g. R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 WLR 135; R. v. Parole Board ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 AER 576).\n#### D. Recent developments\n19. Following the judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV), the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons on 17 October 2002 his decision to introduce interim measures applicable to the review and release of mandatory life sentence prisoners applicable to reviews from 1 January 2003. This allows for prisoners, whose tariff had expired, to apply for an oral hearing at which they may have representation, receive full disclosure of material relevant to the question of release and be able to examine and cross-examine witness.\n\u201cIf, at the end of the review process, the Parole Board favours the release of a mandatory life sentence prisoner once the minimum period has been served the Home Secretary will normally accept such a recommendation. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. Article 5 \u00a7 4 provides:\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Parties\u2019 submissions\n21. The applicant essentially complained about his continued detention following the expiry of his tariff. He relied on the Court\u2019s judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (cited above), and submitted that his case was not reviewed by a body with a power to release or with the necessary safeguards, including, for example, the possibility of an oral hearing.\n22. The Government accepted that following the expiry of the applicant\u2019s tariff, the lawfulness of his detention was not reviewed by a judicial body which had the power to order his release, as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n23. The Court recalls that in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (cited above) it found in respect of a mandatory life prisoner sentenced for murder that, after the expiry of the tariff, which was the punishment element of the sentence, continued detention depended on elements of risk and dangerousness that could change with the course of time. Article 5 \u00a7 4 therefore required that he should be able periodically to challenge the continuing legality of his detention in an appropriate procedure.\n24. In this case, the applicant\u2019s tariff under his mandatory life sentence expired in 1998. While the Parole Board reviewed the applicant\u2019s case in 2001, it did not have any power to order his release and could only make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Nor did any oral hearing take place, with the opportunity to examine or cross-examine witnesses relevant to any allegations that the applicant remained a risk to the public. The Government did not dispute that that the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s continued detention was not reviewed by a body with the power to order release or with a procedure containing the necessary judicial safeguards as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n25. The Court concludes that there has been in that respect a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. The applicant claimed damages for the entire period of imprisonment since expiry of his tariff which he considered unlawful. He claimed pecuniary damage for the earnings as an electrician that he would have received if in the community, namely, 52,000 pounds sterling (GBP) per annum. Concerning non-pecuniary damage, he referred to the feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and frustration endured over the years and claimed GBP 15,000, relying on the length of his wait for a proper review which was ten times longer than that suffered by the applicant in Waite v. the United Kingdom (no. 53236/99, judgment of 10 December 2002), who was awarded GBP 1,500.\n28. The Government submitted that there was no basis for the assertion that the applicant had suffered loss of earnings as a direct result of a violation of the Convention and that he had at all times had been lawfully imprisoned under sentence for murder. In relation to non-pecuniary damage, there was no indication that but for the breach the applicant would have been released as the Parole Board had never recommended release and in their view the finding of a violation would itself constitute just satisfaction.\n29. The Court notes that it has found a procedural breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 above and that there has been no finding of substantive unlawfulness. On the facts of this case, there is no apparent direct causal connection between the pecuniary damage claimed by the applicant and the violation found by the Court. It is not possible to speculate as to the applicant\u2019s prospects of release if the procedures had conformed with Article 5 \u00a7 4. Nonetheless, it considers that the applicant must have suffered feelings of frustration, uncertainty and anxiety from the situation which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of violation. In this respect, while some regard may be had to the length of time over which this situation existed, there can be no mathematical correlation with the period in issue in the Waite case, which concerned a different set of circumstances. The Court awards, on an equitable basis, 1,500 euros (EUR).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n30. The applicant claimed a total of GBP 1,030.39, inclusive of VAT, for legal costs and expenses, which included GBP 677.89 for his solicitor, GBP 117.50 for counsel and GBP 235 for anticipated costs.\n31. The Government noted that the applicant\u2019s schedule of costs did not include a breakdown of dates and items of work done and that in any event most of the submissions had been made by the applicant and that there had been no oral hearing. They queried the anticipated costs item and submitted that a reasonable sum for costs would be GBP 500.\n32. Noting the relative lack of complexity of the procedures in this case and the lack of itemisation of certain aspects of the claim, the Court makes an award of EUR 1,000, inclusive of VAT.\n#### C. Default interest\n33. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, the following amounts:\n(i) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 7 October 2003, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4\nRegistrar President", "001-76766": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF WALKER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26).\n16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%.\n17. Section 6(2) of the Act provides that only those under the state pension age are liable to pay NICs from their earnings. The state pension ages are currently set as 65 for men and 60 for women according to section 122.\n18. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The state pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay NICs will gradually increase in line with the increase in the state pension age.\n### III. EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n19. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits\u201d.\n20. In the Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (\u201cthe EOC case\u201d concerning reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that:\n\u2022 Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference;\n\u2022 Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age;\n\u2022 In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively. (Summary of judgment)\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n21. The applicant, aged over 60, complained that he was required to pay NICs whereas a woman of the same age who was working would not. The relevant provisions of the Convention provide:\n22. Article 14 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n23. The applicant submitted that it was in violation of Article 14 of the Convention that he was required to pay NICs from his earnings while a 60 year old woman who was working would not have to pay such contributions. These contributions now included an extra 1% added under the National Insurance Act 2002, the proceeds of which were included within the National Health Service allocation. He disputed that there was any direct or necessary link between the age of entitlement to the basic state pension (60 for women, 65 for men) and liability to pay NICs. Employers had to pay for female employees regardless of their ages and it was open to women to defer their state pension after the age of 60 and to continue to make contributions to enhance their contribution record.\n24. The applicant submitted that \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d had to be provided to justify sex discrimination and that the more lenient test under Article 1 of Protocol 1, whereby only measures \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d were challengeable, did not apply in such cases. There was no reason why he should have to pay towards the NHS for a longer period than women, which obligation had no objective connection with the state pension age. The recent increase in deductions from the NI Fund for NHS funding purposes was manipulating NICs as a general taxation source which aggravated the existing inequality. As the NI Fund was not in fact self-financing but could be topped up by money from general taxation, it could not be said that changes in contributions would prejudice the equilibrium of the scheme. If women were required to pay, it would in fact boost the amount of funds. Any differences in entitlement were a consequence only of the way in which the Government had chosen to structure the benefit system.\n25. The applicant submitted that the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006) did not decide the issues in his case, as he was primarily complaining of the discrimination, not in the differential eligibility ages for the state pension, but in the differential contribution periods for NICs, a substantial part of which did not go towards funding benefits but was in effect a form of taxation that went to fund the NHS. Even if the Government could justify discrimination in relation to contributions to the social security system, there was no inextricable link between the funding of the NHS and the actual, or notional, working life of an individual. In particular there was no good reason why men between 60 and 64 should contribute to the NHS but that women of the age were exempt. While there was a factual link of sorts between work and contributions, they pointed out that individuals not in work, or who had caring responsibilities could also pay or be credited with contributions. He also pointed out that employers continued to pay NICs on behalf of employees regardless of whether they had reached the state pension age. Finally, he argued that the ECJ in the various rulings on benefits and contributions had not addressed the issues in the case.\n##### 2. The Government\n26. The Government accepted that Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was applicable to any discrimination in the obligation to make NICs. They claimed that it was not possible to dissociate the obligation on working males between 60 and 65 to pay NICs from the different state retirement ages for men and women. The level and duration of NI contributions were necessarily linked to the assumed working life and thus the fixed state retirement age for men. While women aged 60-65 were able to defer their state pensions and continue to work without paying NICs, men aged 65-70 also had that possibility. It was not correct that women could elect to pay contributions, save in respect of voluntary Class 3 contributions for those years before the tax year when the woman reached the age of 60.\n27. The Government disputed that the NICs paid by any individual could be analysed as being in substance two separate contributions, one to the NHS and the other to the NI Fund. The payments were dissociable, as allocations were made at an aggregate level on the basis of forecasts made by the Inland Revenue. If the obligation to pay NICs was discriminatory as a whole, this fell within the scope of Article 7(1)a of the Directive 79/7/EEC (see paragraph 18 above), the purpose and content of which justified any difference in treatment. Even assuming the NICs were two separate contributions, they were capable of separate justification as being in the proportionate pursuit of legitimate aims.\n28. The Government pointed out, that along with other EC and Contracting States, they were in the process of phasing out differing pensionable ages for men and women and whilst doing so were protected as a matter of EC law. By phasing out differential treatment in a measured and controlled fashion that maintained the financial equilibrium of the social security system and protected the expectations of older women who had planned to retire and receive their state pension at age 60, the Government submitted that they were acting in an objectively justified and proportionate manner. It was an area undoubtedly attracting a very broad margin of appreciation as it involved complex economic and social judgments as well as economic management.\n29. The Government considered that the Stec judgment (cited above) had in substance disposed of the issues in this case. They emphasised the wide margin of appreciation recognised by the Grand Chamber as applying to general measures of economic or social strategy and submitted that it fell within that margin to adopt a system which expected all those making NICs to pay a proportion of such contributions to the NHS. Such a system was both coherent and easy to administer, whereas devising a special system of contributions for male employees between 60 and 64 which removed the NHS allocation would be cumbersome, complex and difficult to implement for employers as well as the revenue service.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n30. Article 14 of the Convention has no independent existence; it has effect solely in relation to \u201cthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms\u201d safeguarded by those provisions. There can be no room for its application unless the facts at issue fall within the ambit of one or more of them (see, amongst other authorities, Gaygusuz v. Austria, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions, 1996-IV, \u00a7 36). The Court notes that the Government does not contest in this case that the obligation on the applicant to pay NICs falls within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and thus that Article 14 is applicable to any complaint of discrimination in that respect. It would also recall that there is authority that such a situation involves the right of the State to \u201csecure the payment of taxes or other contributions\u201c and therefore comes within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1(see Van Raalte v. the Netherlands, judgment of 21 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, \u00a7 \u00a734-35). Article 14 is accordingly engaged.\n31. The principal issue in this case is whether the difference in treatment whereby this applicant is required to pay NICs when working over the age of 60, whereas a woman of that age would not, discloses discrimination contrary to Article 14 of the Convention.\n32. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, a difference in treatment is discriminatory for the purposes of Article 14 if it \u201chas no objective and reasonable justification\u201d, that is if it does not pursue a \u201clegitimate aim\u201d or if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised. The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether or not and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment. However, very weighty reasons are required before the Court would regard a difference of treatment based exclusively on the grounds of sex as compatible with the Convention (see, among other authorities, Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, ECHR 2002-IV, \u00a7 39).\n33. Against this must be balanced the countervailing proposition that the margin of appreciation available to the legislature in implementing social and economic policies should be a wide one (see, inter alia, James v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A, no. 98, \u00a7 46). This applies to systems of taxation or contributions which must inevitably differentiate between groups of tax-payers and the implementation of which unavoidably creates marginal situations. A Government may often have to strike a balance between the need to raise revenue and reflecting other social objectives in taxation policies. The national authorities are obviously in a better position than the Court to assess those needs and requirements, which in the present case involve complex concerns about the financing of pensions and the national health service which impact on the community as a whole. In such an area the Court will generally respect the legislature\u2019s policy choice unless it is manifestly unreasonable (see, as the latest authority, Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n34. The Court recalls that in the afore-mentioned Stec case the Grand Chamber had occasion to examine the alleged inequality arising out of entitlement to the reduced earnings allowance (\u201cREA\u201c) which was linked to the age of eligibility to the state pension. Similarly, in this case, the applicant\u2019s obligation to pay NICs was linked to the date at which he was eligible to obtain his state pension. Much argument has been devoted by the parties to the nature of NICs, in particular the extent to which they fund benefits, including the pension and thus are logically and necessarily linked to the date at which a person received his or her pension and whether the element paid towards the NHS is a form of general taxation without such linkage. In Stec, the REA was found to be a benefit designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or incapacity and thus connected to employment and working life. The Court would note that in the present case, the applicants have accepted that there was clearly a factual link between work and contributions since most people making such contributions did so by virtue of their earnings as employees or because they were employees. The use of the state pension age as a cut-off point for contributions made, the Government argued, the scheme easy to understand and to administer. As in Stec, the Court accepts that such questions of administrative economy and coherence are generally matters falling within the margin of appreciation referred to above (\u00a7 57). The fact that over time an increasing percentage of the NI fund has been diverted to the NHS and that there are exceptions to the general position (as in voluntary contributions and the ongoing contributions of employers regardless of age) does not render the policy choice manifestly unreasonable. While it is true that women who continue to work over their pension age do not have to pay NICs, the same also applies to men who work over their pension age.\n35. Although, unlike the Stec case, there is no judgment by the ECJ directly bearing on differential requirements to pay NICs, the Court notes that in the EOC case it found that inequality between men and women with respect to the contributions periods could not be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age (see paragraph 19 above). Its stance as regards the justification in avoiding disruption to the pension system is therefore of some persuasive value even in the present case.\n36. The Court accordingly concludes that, as in the Stec case, the linkage of NICs to the notional end of working life or state pensionable age must be regarded as pursuing a legitimate aim and as being reasonably and objectively justified (see \u00a7 59).\n37. As regards the actual difference in the state pension age between men and women, the Grand Chamber in Stec had this to say:\n\u201c61. Differential pensionable ages were first introduced for men and women in the United Kingdom in 1940, well before the Convention had come into existence, although the disparity persists to the present day (see paragraph 32 above). It would appear that the difference in treatment was adopted in order to mitigate financial inequality and hardship arising out of the woman\u2019s traditional unpaid role of caring for the family in the home rather than earning money in the workplace. At their origin, therefore, the differential pensionable ages were intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between men and women and appear therefore to have been objectively justified under Article 14 (see paragraph 51 above).\n62. It follows that the difference in pensionable ages continued to be justified until such time that social conditions had changed so that women were no longer substantially prejudiced because of a shorter working life. This change, must, by its very nature, have been gradual, and it would be difficult or impossible to pinpoint any particular moment when the unfairness to men caused by differential pensionable ages began to outweigh the need to correct the disadvantaged position of women. Certain indications are available to the Court. Thus, in the 1993 White Paper, the Government asserted that the number of women in paid employment had increased significantly, so that whereas in 1967 only 37% of employees were women, the proportion had increased to 50% in 1992. In addition, various reforms to the way in which pension entitlement was assessed had been introduced in 1977 and 1978, to the benefit of women who spent long periods out of paid employment. As of 1986, it was unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women (see paragraph 33 above).\n63. According to the information before the Court, the Government made a first, concrete, move towards establishing the same pensionable age for both sexes with the publication of the Green Paper in December 1991. It would, no doubt, be possible to argue that this step could, or should, have been made earlier. However, as the Court has observed, the development of parity in the working lives of men and women has been a gradual process, and one which the national authorities are better placed to assess (see paragraph 52 above). Moreover, it is significant that many of the other Contracting States still maintain a difference in the ages at which men and women become eligible for the State retirement pension (see paragraph 37 above). Within the European Union, this position is recognised by the exception contained in the Directive (see paragraph 38 ...).\n64. In the light of the original justification for the measure as correcting financial inequality between the sexes, the slowly evolving nature of the change in women\u2019s working lives, and in the absence of a common standard amongst the Contracting States (see Petrovic, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-43), the Court finds that the United Kingdom cannot be criticised for not having started earlier on the road towards a single pensionable age.\n65. Having once begun the move towards equality, moreover, the Court does not consider it unreasonable of the Government to carry out a thorough process of consultation and review, nor can Parliament be condemned for deciding in 1995 to introduce the reform slowly and in stages. Given the extremely far-reaching and serious implications, for women and for the economy in general, these are matters which clearly fall within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation.\n38. The alleged discrimination in the present case concerns exactly the difference in ages of entitlement to the state pension discussed above. In light of the Grand Chamber\u2019s finding that the policy adapted by the legislature in deferring equalisation of the pension age for men and women until 2020 falls within the State\u2019s margin of appreciation, the Court cannot but reach the same conclusion in the present case.\n39. There has, accordingly, been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 22 August 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n8. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n9. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to grant him WBA or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n10. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n11. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n12. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n14. The applicant claimed 482 pounds sterling (GBP) for WBA, plus tax, in respect of pecuniary damage.\n15. The Government argued that such an award could not be made, having regard to the Court\u2019s case-law in this area.\n16. In its lead judgment regarding WBA the Court found no reason to remedy the inequality of treatment by \u201clevelling up\u201d and awarding the value of tax benefits which had been found to be unjustified. It accordingly made no award in respect of the pecuniary loss alleged to have been suffered (see Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007, \u00a7 69).\n17. The Court finds no reason to depart from this finding and consequently no award can be made under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n18. The applicant made no claim under this head.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Decides to disjoin the application from the others to which it was joined;\n2.

The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14-26, ECHR 2002-IV.\n## COMPLAINTS\n8. The applicant complained that British social security legislation discriminated against him on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nTHE LAW\n9. By a letter of 11 May 2005 the respondent Government informed the Court that the House of Lords had decided, in relation to the claims for Widowed Mother's Allowance (WMA) and Widow's Payment (WPt), that there was in principle no objective justification at the relevant time for not paying these benefits to widowers as well as widows, but that the Government had a defence under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA). It noted that, in view of this, the multitude of cases before the Court and the fact that the HRA defence was only applicable in the domestic arena, the Government were prepared, in principle, to settle all claims made by widowers against the United Kingdom arising out of the arrangements applicable prior to April 2001 for the payment of WMA and WPt.\n10. On 23 April 2007 the applicant's representative notified the Court that Mr Arkwell had been offered GBP 18,195.71 in respect of his claim for WPt and/or WMA and that he had accepted payment. The applicant's representative further requested the Court to adjourn the claim for Widow's Pension. On 30 April 2007 the applicant's representative was sent a letter by the Registry stating that the Court would consider striking the case out of its list in respect of the claim which has been settled, while the claim in respect of Widow's Pension would be adjourned until the Court's lead judgment on that issue, Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom (nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99), delivered on 10 May 2007, had become final (see paragraph 13 below). The representative has not sent a letter objecting to the striking out of the former claim. On 3 August 2007 the applicant's representative was sent another letter by the Registry stating that the latter judgment had become final on 25 July 2007 following the parties' notification that neither side intended to seek referral of the case to the Grand Chamber (Article 44 \u00a7 2 (a) of the Convention).\n11. The Court takes note of the agreement reached between the parties in respect of WPt and/or WMA (Article 39 of the Convention). It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention or its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n12. In respect of Mr Arkwell's claim regarding Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), it is noted that his children are now 23 and 19 years of age and it is possible that a woman in his position would have ceased to be entitled to WMA and become entitled to WP.\n13. In the Court's lead judgment regarding WP the Court held that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007). The Court, consequently, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow's Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n14. The Court finds no reason to depart from these findings in the present case.\n15. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n16. In conclusion, therefore, the Court strikes out of its list the applicant's complaints as regards Widow's Payment and Widowed Mother's Allowance and finds no violation in respect of the applicant's complaint as regards Widow's Pension.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to strike out of its list of cases the complaints about non\u2011entitlement to a Widow's Payment and Widowed Mother's Allowance;\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007; and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, 25 July 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n13. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d), Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d), Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n14. By a letter of 12 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr O\u2019Brien had been offered GBP 12,393.23 in respect of his claims for Wpt and/or WMA including costs and that he had accepted the offer. By a letter of 16 May 2007 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr O\u2019Brien had received the said payment.\n15. The Court takes note of the friendly settlement reached between the parties in respect of Wpt and/or WMA. It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n16. Consequently, this part of the application should be struck out of the list.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n17. The Government contested the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s claim for the tax year 1999/2000 on the basis that he had only made an oral claim, therefore failing to comply with a domestic requirement. According to domestic legal provisions, telephone claims could be accepted from 1998 onwards, but only if they related to the current year of assessment, namely, the year of assessment in which the claim was made, or the following year. In the present case Mr O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim for the tax year 1999/2000 referred to a previous year of assessment. Consequently, the applicant cannot claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.\n18. The applicant submitted that the Court should not differ from its holding in White v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.53134/99) in which it rejected the Government\u2019s plea regarding benefit claims not made in the proper format. Indeed there were no reasons why claims for WBA could not be treated on a par with claims for other bereavement benefits.\n19. The Court recalls that the precise form in which an applicant indicates his intention to claim benefits is not of importance, the central question being whether the applicant has made clear his wish to claim benefits (see White, cited above). The Court finds that in the present case the applicant made clear such intention for both years of assessment, whether in writing or orally, and he can accordingly claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention for the purposes of Article 34.\n20. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n21. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n22. The Court has examined the present case and finds that the Government have not presented any facts or arguments which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n23. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### C. Widow\u2019s Pension\n24. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41). The Court, consequently, considering it was not necessary to examine separately the complaint in respect of Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of WP or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n25. Consequently, this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. The applicant left it to the Court to grant any financial compensation considered equitable.\n28. The Government did not make any submissions on that point.\n29. In its lead judgment regarding WBA the Court found no reason to remedy the inequality of treatment by \u201clevelling up\u201d and awarding the value of tax benefits which had been found to be unjustified. It accordingly made no award in respect of the pecuniary loss alleged to have been suffered (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 69). Moreover, the Court does not accept that the applicant was caused real and serious emotional damage as a result of being denied a tax allowance of the relatively low value of the WBA (ibid \u00a7 72).\n30. The Court finds no reason to depart from these findings and consequently no award can be made under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n31. The applicant also claimed GBP 1,007.80 in respect of costs and expenses, inclusive of value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d).\n32. The Government did not make any submissions on that point.\n33. The Court reiterates that only such costs and expenses as were actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the violation or violations found, and are reasonable as to quantum, are recoverable under Article 41 (see, for example, \u015eahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII). On the basis of the information in its possession and taking into account that the issues concerning WBA were established in Hobbs (cited above) the Court awards the applicant EUR 600 for legal costs and expenses, in addition to any VAT that may be payable.\n#### C. Default interest\n34. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to strike out the applicant\u2019s complaints concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance;\n2. Declares admissible the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in connection with the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning non-entitlement to a Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amount to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 600 (six hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(ii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amount;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 17 July 2008, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nLawrence Early Lech Garlicki\nRegistrar President", "001-83404": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF CRILLY v.

The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n8. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to grant him WBA or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1.

No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n9. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n10. The Court has examined the present case and finds that the Government have not presented any facts or arguments which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n11. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n12. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage\n13. The applicant did not submit any claims in respect of pecuniary and non pecuniary damage.\n14. Consequently, the Court makes no award under this head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n15. The applicant claimed GBP 4,200 in respect of costs and expenses, inclusive of value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d). He made reference to the Court's case law in Crossland v. the United Kingdom, (no. 36120/97, 9 November 1999) which involved the representation of a single client and in which the costs awarded were similar to those claimed by the applicant.\n16. The Government contested the claim. It held that in the present case what was at stake was a tax allowance amounting to GBP 543. Consequently legal expenses amounting to eight times as much could not be considered reasonable as to quantum. Moreover, the Government did not consider reasonable the amount of time claimed to have been spent on the application and the professional fees per hour. Consequently, they submitted that 400 euros would be a reasonable sum in respect of legal costs and expenses.\n17. The Court reiterates that only such costs and expenses as were actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the violation or violations found, and are reasonable as to quantum, are recoverable under Article 41 (see, for example, \u015eahin v. Germany [GC], no. 30943/96, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2003-VIII).

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 December 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended the disciplinary and court-martial procedures regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955. References below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to the Army Act 1955 as amended. The statutory disciplinary provisions applicable to armed forces personnel are contained in the above-listed three \u201cservice discipline Acts\u201d. Each Act specifies, in virtually identical terms, the offences for which persons subject to that Act can be tried and the punishments applicable. Persons subject to armed forces law are thereby subjected to a common code of offences and punishments.\n#### A. The Offence\n20. The offences triable under the 1955 Act include misconduct in action; offences by or in relation to sentries, person on watch etc; failure to attend for, neglect of, duty; looting; mutiny and related offences; insubordinate behaviour; disobedience of a lawful command or standing order; desertion, absence without leave and related offences; malingering, drunkenness, disorderly conduct and fighting; refusal to submit to drug testing; false statements on entry or enlistment; offences harmful to morale; scandalous or disgraceful behaviour; ill-treatment of persons of inferior rank and conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (see sections 24-68 of the 1955 Act).\n21. In addition to the above, any person subject to armed forces law who commits a civilian offence (any act punishable by the laws of England) is also guilty of an offence against the service discipline Acts (section 70 of the 1955 Act).\n22. Section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cAny person subject to military law who - ...\n(b) uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer\nshall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.\u201d\n#### B. Summary trial: investigations\n23. Section 76 of the 1955 Act provides that an allegation that an accused has committed an offence, including the offence cited above, shall be reported to his commanding officer (\u201cCO\u201d). Regulation 25 of the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Regulations\u201d - enacted under section 83 of the 1955 Act) provides that COs shall investigate the charge by, inter alia, causing such enquiries to be made as appear necessary. Following investigation, the CO may dismiss the charge, refer the charge to a higher authority or deal with it summarily.\n#### C. Summary trial: hearings\n24. Regulation 9 of the 1997 Regulations notes that COs may deal summarily with any charge under section 33 of the 1955 Act. Before dealing summarily with a charge, a CO shall, inter alia, call witnesses whose evidence he considers may be relevant to the charge, allow the accused to question those witnesses, allow the accused to give evidence on his own behalf and allow the accused to call his own witnesses (Regulation 29 of the 1997 Regulations). The CO had to either hear evidence orally himself or cause it to be reduced to writing. The latter was obligatory if it was considered that extended detention could be awarded on any finding of guilt (see \u201cPenalties\u201d at paragraph 28 below).\n25. If, having heard the evidence, the CO finds that the charge has been proved, the CO shall, before so recording, afford the accused the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial (Section 76B of the 1955 Act). If the accused does not so elect, the CO can, inter alia, record a finding of guilty and award penalties.\n26. While an accused cannot be legally represented at the CO hearing, Chapter 62 of the Army General Administrative Instructions (\u201cAGAIs\u201d) describes the Accused\u2019s Adviser procedure. The Adviser acts in the accused\u2019s best interests but is not to be considered a form of defence lawyer and is not legally qualified. An Adviser\u2019s function is limited to advising the accused before and at the hearing (for example, as regards whether to elect trial by court-martial) and making a statement during the trial about the accused\u2019s background and in mitigation. Detailed guidance for the Accused\u2019 Adviser is set out at Annex M to Chapter 62, including on the procedure for electing trial by court-martial and the advice to be given to an accused in that respect.\n#### D. Penalties\n27. The maximum duration of the imprisonment for the offence of using insubordinate language is not defined under the 1955 Act.\n28. By virtue of Regulation 12 of the 1997 Regulations, a CO dealing summarily with an offence can make an award of detention not exceeding 28 days unless he complies with Regulation 31 of the 1997 Regulations. That Regulation provides that a CO may award extended detention (up to 60 days) if he has taken written statements from all the witnesses (Regulation 31(3)), satisfied himself that the accused was not likely to dispute the charge (Regulation 31(4)), obtained permission from a higher authority to award extended detention (Regulation 31(5) and (7)) and informed the accused of his extended powers (Regulation 31(9)).\n29. A district court-martial can award imprisonment of up to two years (section 85(2) of the 1955 Act). There is no upward limit on the awards of imprisonment of a general court-martial.\n#### E. The Pamphlet\n30. All soldiers are provided with a pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Rights of a Soldier Charged with an Offence under the Army Act 1955\u201d. The pamphlet was amended on 1 October 1997 following the entry into force of the 1996 Act.\n31. The post-October 1997 version of the pamphlet submitted by the Government in the present case informs soldiers of their right to have an Accused\u2019s Adviser both before and during the hearing, of the role of the Adviser (see paragraph 26 above), the procedure at the hearing, the penalties available, the procedure for applying for extended detention powers, the means of electing for trial by court-martial (including when and how much time is accorded to decide), the time available to withdraw any such election and the consequences of such an election (including the possibility of being prosecuted on more serious charges).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant made various complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention, which provisions, in so far as relevant, read as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ....\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n...\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6\n33. The applicant contended that the charges against him were \u201ccriminal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 having regard to the three criteria outlined at paragraph 82 of the Engel judgment (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22). While he accepted that the relevant offence was disciplinary in domestic law and in nature, he argued that the penalty risked rendered it criminal. The maximum penalty risked by him was life imprisonment (if he was tried by general court-martial), two years\u2019 imprisonment (if tried by a district court-martial) or 60 days\u2019 imprisonment (the extended sentencing powers of a CO).\n34. Prior to admissibility, the Government noted that the offence was disciplinary in domestic law and in nature and considered that neither the penalty risked nor that awarded was sufficiently severe as to \u201ctransform\u201d a disciplinary offence into a criminal one. Following admissibility, the Government did not comment on the applicability of Article 6.\n35. The Court notes that it remains undisputed that the starting-point, for the assessment of the applicability of the criminal aspect of Article 6 of the Convention to the present proceedings, is the criteria outlined at paragraph 82 of the above-cited Engel judgment:\n\u201c...[I]t is first necessary to know whether the provision(s) defining the offence charged belong, according to the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law, disciplinary law or both concurrently. This however provides no more than a starting point. The indications so afforded have only a formal and relative value and must be examined in the light of the common denominator of the respective legislation of the various Contracting States.\nThe very nature of the offence is a factor of greater import. ...\nHowever, supervision by the Court does not stop there. Such supervision would generally prove to be illusory if it did not also take into consideration the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring.\u201d\n36. In its more recent judgment in the case of Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003\u2011X), the Court clarified as follows:\n86. In addition, it is the Court\u2019s established jurisprudence that the second and third criteria laid down in Engel are alternative and not necessarily cumulative: for Article 6 to be held applicable, it suffices that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or that the offence made the person liable to a sanction which, by its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere .... This does not exclude that a cumulative approach may be adopted where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge ...\n...\n120. The nature and severity of the penalty which was \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d on the applicants ... are determined by reference to the maximum potential penalty for which the relevant law provides ...\nThe actual penalty imposed is relevant to the determination ... but it cannot diminish the importance of what was initially at stake (see Engel and Others, cited above, p. 36, \u00a7 85, together with Demicoli, Garyfallou AEBE and Weber, loc. cit.).\u201d\n37. In its Ezeh and Connors judgment, the Court referred specifically to the following extract from paragraph 82 of the Engel judgment:\n\u201cIn a society subscribing to the rule of law, there belong to the \u2018criminal\u2019 sphere deprivations of liberty liable to be imposed as a punishment, except those which by their nature, duration or manner of execution cannot be appreciably detrimental. The seriousness of what is at stake, the traditions of the Contracting States and the importance attached by the Convention to respect for the physical liberty of the person all require that this should be so.\u201d\nand went on to conclude (at paragraph 126) that:\n\u201cAccordingly, given the deprivations of liberty liable to be and actually imposed on the present applicants, there is a presumption that the charges against them were criminal within the meaning of Article 6, a presumption which could be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if those deprivations of liberty could not be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given their nature, duration or manner of execution.\u201d\n38. The offence at issue in the present case (using insubordinate language to a superior officer) was, in the Court\u2019s view, disciplinary in domestic law and in nature. It was one of the service disciplinary offences listed in the 1955 Act (see paragraphs 19-22 above) to be prosecuted by the services only. Its aim was to maintain discipline within the armed forces and there was no apparent civilian criminal equivalent (Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, \u00a7 71).\n39. However, the Engel criteria being alternative and not necessarily cumulative, the \u201ccriminal\u201d nature of the relevant \u201coffence\u201d could, in principle, be determined solely on the basis of the nature and severity of the sanction.\n40. It was not disputed, and the Court finds, that the applicant\u2019s confinement in a locked battalion guardroom amounted to a deprivation of liberty (the above-cited Engel judgment, at \u00a7 63 and Stephen Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 30280/96, \u00a7 25, 14 March 2000). Since a deprivation of liberty was liable to be and was actually imposed on the applicant, there was a presumption that the charge against him was \u201ccriminal\u201d, a presumption which could be rebutted entirely exceptionally and only if his deprivation of liberty could not be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given its nature, duration or manner of execution (the above-cited Ezeh and Connors judgment, at \u00a7 126).\n41. The parties disagreed on the severity of the penalty \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d: the Government argued that it was 28 days and the applicant maintained that it was either life imprisonment, two years or sixty days for the reasons outlined above. However, the applicant did not select trial by court-martial and the CO did not take any of the steps required by Regulation 31 (and listed at paragraph 28 above) in order to obtain extended detention powers in the applicant\u2019s case. Consequently, the sentence \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d was the maximum penalty of 28 days which was available at the moment of the applicant\u2019s summary trial before the CO (Engel, at \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 85), this period being the equivalent of an eight-week sentence in a domestic criminal court. The actual sentence imposed was 7 days\u2019 detention.\n42. The Court concludes that the deprivation of liberty which was liable to be, and which actually was, imposed on the applicant cannot be regarded as sufficiently unimportant or inconsequential as to displace the presumption as to the criminal nature of the charge against him.\n43. It finds that the applicant was charged with a \u201ccriminal offence\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 which provision applies therefore to his complaints.\n#### B. Waiver of rights under Article 6 of the Convention\n44. The applicant maintained that any waiver by him of a trial by court-martial could not be considered to be valid. The Government observed that the applicant declined to elect trial by court-martial and submitted that there were no important public interest considerations which might suggest that the matter should have been dealt with otherwise than summarily. In such circumstances, they argued that he made a voluntary, informed and unequivocal election to waive his rights under Article 6 of the Convention. Contrary to the position in the case of Thompson v. the United Kingdom (no. 36256/97, 15 June 2004), the present applicant could have chosen a court-martial convened under the 1996 Act which would have fully complied with the requirements of the Convention (Cooper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48843/99, ECHR 2003\u2011XII). He could have taken legal advice and, even if he could not be legally represented at the summary hearing, he had access to the Accused\u2019s Adviser.\n45. The Court recalls that a waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention \u2013 in so far as it is permissible \u2013 must not run counter to any important public interest, must be established in an unequivocal manner and requires minimum guarantees commensurate to the waiver\u2019s importance (H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A No. 171, \u00a7 66 and Pfeifer and Plankl v. Austria, judgment of 25 February 1992, Series A No. 227, \u00a7 37).\n46. It is further recalled that the Court found in the above-cited Thompson case that, even supposing that the Article 6 rights in question could be waived, the circumstances surrounding Mr Thompson\u2019s waiver deprived it of any validity from the point of view of the Convention. The Court gave three reasons.\n47. In the first place, it referred to certain structural elements of the summary procedure:\n\u201c44. The Court notes ... that the applicant was directly subordinate, and in close structural proximity, to his [CO], a factor which undoubtedly would have affected the free and unambiguous nature of any choice between a summary trial and a court-martial. The applicant would also have been influenced by the fact that a summary procedure involved a maximum sentence of 28 days (and 60 days only if extended powers were granted) whereas trial by a district court-martial could have in theory ... led to a sentence of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. ... Moreover, the fact that the option was presented to him at all meant that his [CO] considered him to be guilty as charged and, further, that he warranted more than a minor punishment. The applicant would have been aware of all of these matters from, inter alia, the information pamphlet which he accepted he would have obtained in Northern Ireland.\u201d\nEven assuming the applicant received the post-October 1997 Pamphlet (see paragraph 31 above) as maintained by the Government, the Court considers that the above-cited reasoning remains entirely applicable to the present case, and indeed the Government did not contest this.\n48. Secondly, the Court in the Thompson case pointed out that the applicant, as a layman, was not in a position to evaluate his legal position in February 1997 or, consequently, the options to be pursued by him. Legal representation was not allowed at the summary hearing when the opportunity to elect was afforded to an accused which absence, in turn, would have rendered it difficult for a lawyer to comprehensively advise an accused during the period thereafter when the election would have become definitive. The Court considers that this reasoning also remains relevant to the present case despite the Government\u2019s submissions to the contrary: the legal representation position and the role of the Accused\u2019s Adviser were substantively similar in both cases.\n49. It is true that the remaining reason given in the Thompson case cannot be applied to the present. When the court-martial option was presented to Mr Thompson, the court-martial system in place at that point was considered by this Court to violate the independence and impartiality guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011I). However, when that option was available to the present applicant, the 1996 Act had reformed the army court-martial system so as to comply with the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (Cooper v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48843/99, ECHR 2003\u2011XII).\n50. However, the Court considers that the two matters detailed at paragraphs 47 and 48 above are sufficient to allow it to conclude that, even supposing that the Article 6 rights in question could in principle have been be waived, the circumstances were such that there was no valid waiver by the applicant of his rights under that Article.\n#### C. Merits of the complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(c)\n51. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 that the CO was not independent or impartial (since the CO acted as prosecutor and judge) and that the proceedings before the CO were consequently unfair. He also complained that those proceedings were not \u201cpublic\u201d and that the CO did not constitute a tribunal \u201cestablished by law\u201d. In addition, he complained under Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) that legal representation was excluded from his summary trial. The Government contested the violations.\n52. The Court recalls that, in the above-cited Thompson case, it concluded that the summary procedure presented even clearer structural independence and impartiality problems than those established in the above-cited Findlay case and, further, that those proceedings were, consequently, unfair. The Court went on in that case to find that the exclusion of legal representation from the applicant\u2019s summary trial constituted a separate issue from the structural breaches of Article 6 \u00a7 1 which had been established and gave rise to an additional violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) of the Convention (citing, inter alia, Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, \u00a7 64).\n53. The Court does not see any reason in the present case to depart from those conclusions and, for the reasons outlined in detail in paragraphs 46-47 of the Thompson judgment, finds that the summary procedure before the CO violated the independence, impartiality and, consequently, fairness aspects of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and that the exclusion of legal representation from the applicant\u2019s summary trial also constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) of the Convention.\n54. The Court does not consider it necessary separately to examine his complaints about the \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cestablished by law\u201d elements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (the above-cited Findlay judgment, at \u00a7 80).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n55. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n56. The applicant claimed 400 pounds sterling (GBP) in pecuniary damages for loss of pay he incurred as a result of his detention and GBP 2,000 in non-pecuniary damage as he felt aggrieved and humiliated by his detention. The Government contested these claims, arguing that the finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction.\n57. As in the above-cited cases of Findlay (at \u00a7\u00a7 85 and 88), Ezeh and Connors judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 141-143) and Thompson (at \u00a7\u00a7 51-52), the Court considers that it is impossible to speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings against the applicant had the violations of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3(c) of the Convention not occurred.\n58. Accordingly, it finds that the present judgment in itself constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for any pecuniary and/or non-pecuniary damage arising from the violations of Article 6 of the Convention established.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n59. The applicant claimed for 20 hours\u2019 work of one lawyer with a charge out hourly rate of GBP 150, amounting to a total sum of GBP 3,000 (exclusive of VAT). The Government considered the appropriate charge out rate to be GBP 100 and contested six of the hours for which the applicant billed for work done in January 2001.\n60. The Court recalls that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, for example, Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2000-IX).\n61. It is noted that all of the legal work in the present case was completed after the adoption of the judgment in the above-cited Findlay, and Benham cases, the central relevance of which judgments is evident from the Court\u2019s reasoning on the merits of the complaints (paragraphs 51-54 above). Indeed the applicant and Mr Findlay had the same legal representative. The six hours\u2019 work contested by the Government clearly relates to the applicant\u2019s main observations submitted in response to those of the Government in January 2000, and not January 2001 as the applicant\u2019s just satisfaction submission had incorrectly noted.\n62. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court awards the sum of 2,500 euros (\u201cEUR\u201d) in respect of costs and expenses (inclusive of any VAT which may be chargeable), which amount is to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable on the date of settlement.\n#### C. Default interest\n63. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds by 6 votes to 1 that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in that the applicant did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal;\n2. Holds by 6 votes to 1 that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3(c) of the Convention;\n3. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine separately the remaining complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n4. Holds unanimously that the findings of a violation of Article 6 constitute in themselves sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n##### 5. Holds unanimously\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 2,500 (two thousand five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses which is inclusive of any VAT chargeable and which is to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 16 January 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L. Early J. Casadevall\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the dissenting opinion of Mr Maruste is annexed to this judgment\n#### J.C.M.\nT.L.E.\n.\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MARUSTE\nThe majority relies very much on the application of the Engel criteria (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22) in the judgment in Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003\u2011X). I can agree partly since there are some similarities, but there are also circumstances which would distinguish this case from Ezeh and Connors.\nThe present case is about a fresh conviction not related to serving a lawful and current prison sentence. The similarity comes from the \u201cwhat was originally at stake\u201d problem. It is suggested that, if the case was tried by a district court-martial, the applicant could have \u201cin theory\u201d faced a sentence of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment and, in paragraph 47 of the attached judgment, the majority endorsed this position. However, it must be noted that the expression \u201cin theory\u201d is speculative and, further, it is clear from the circumstances and nature of the present case that that was very unlikely to happen and no case law was produced to substantiate such a scenario.\nIt should also be noted that the applicant could have opted, but refused to so opt, for trial by court-martial. In outlining its reasoning on the waiver point, the majority of the Chamber relied upon the Thomson case (Thompson v. the United Kingdom, no. 36256/97, 15 June 2004) but not specifically applying it to the circumstances of the present case. No evidence was produced that the applicant had not understood the differences between two procedures, even with the assistance of the Accused\u2019s Adviser and the post-October 1997 Pamphlet. It was just presumed by analogy. This is not convincing for me and I consider the waiver to be valid in the circumstances.\nFinally, I consider some discretionary, speedy and summary disciplinary measures as a necessary and natural part of military service, without which the army would lose part of its effectiveness and operationality. It would be my understanding that these considerations were behind the Eggs decision (Eggs v. Switzerland No. 7341/76, Commission decision of 4 March 1978, Decisions and Reports 15, p. 35, \u00a7 79) where the Commission found that, although relatively harsh, that penalty restricting freedom could not, either by its duration or by the conditions of its enforcement in Basle prison, have caused serious detriment to the applicant. That procedure could not, therefore, be classified as criminal.\nFor more elaborated (dissenting) views about the above-cited Ezeh and Connors judgment which I still maintain, I would refer the reader to the joint dissenting opinion in that case.", "001-61080": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF APPLEBY AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 44306/98)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n6 May 2003\nFINAL\n24/09/2003\nIn the case of Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, President,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 April 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person\u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness.\n23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right:\n\u201cOf more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law.\nThe case of Harrison v. Carswell (1975) 62 D.L.R. 3d 68 in the Supreme Court of Canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre, against the wishes of the owner of the centre. The majority of the Supreme Court held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. However, Laskin C.J.C., in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public, the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner\u2019s whim. He said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and \u2013\n\u2019If it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.\u2019\nI have already said that this was a dissenting judgment. Nevertheless counsel [for the applicants] submitted that we should apply it in the present case. I accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary. However there is no such necessity where Parliament has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by section 18 of the Highways Act 1971 and section 35 of the Highways Act 1980. (Harrison v. Carswell makes no mention of any similar legislation in Canada.) Where Parliament has legislated and the Council, as representing the public, chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides, it is not for the courts to intervene.\nI would allow this appeal ... on the basis that CIN had the right, subject only to the issue under section 20 of the Race Relations Act 1976, to determine any licence the [applicants] may have had to enter the Centre.\u201d\n### III. CASES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS\n24. The parties have referred to case-law from the United States and Canada.\n#### A. The United States\n25. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.\n26. The United States Supreme Court has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places, such as streets and parks, known as \u201cpublic fora\u201d for the exercise of free speech (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organisation, 307 U.S. (United States: Supreme Court Reports) 496 (1939)). In Marsh v. Alabama (326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. (Supreme Court Reporter) 276, 90 L.Ed. (United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers\u2019 Edition) 265 (1946)), the Supreme Court also held that a privately owned corporate town (a company town) having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the First Amendment rights of free speech and peaceable assembly. It has found that the First Amendment does not require access to privately owned properties, such as shopping centres, on the basis that there has to be \u201cState action\u201d (a degree of State involvement) for the amendment to apply (see, for example, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976)).\n27. The United States Supreme Court has taken the position that the First Amendment does not prevent a private shopping-centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations (Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 47 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed. 2d 131 (1972)). This did not however prevent State constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the Federal Constitution to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping-centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions (Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robbins, 447 U.S. 74, 64 L.Ed. 2d 741, 100 S.Ct. 2035 (1980)).\n28. Some State courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their State constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures (see, for example, Batchelder v. Allied Stores Int\u2019l, N.E. (West\u2019s North Eastern Reporter) 2d 590 (Massachussetts, 1983); Lloyd Corp. v. Whiffen, 849 P. (West\u2019s Pacific Reporter) 2d 446, 453-54 (Oregon, 1993); Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., 780 P. 2d 1282 (Washington, 1989)). Some cases found State obligations arising due to State involvement, for example, Bock v. Westminster Mall Co., 819 P. 2d 55 (Colorado, 1991) (the shopping centre was a State actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas), and Jamestown v. Beneda, 477 N.W. (West\u2019s North Western Reporter) 2d 830 (North Dakota, 1991) (where the shopping centre was owned by a public body, although leased to a private developer).\n29. Other cases cited as indicating a right to reasonable access to property under State private law were State v. Shack, 277 A. (West\u2019s Atlantic Reporter) 2d 369 (New Jersey, 1971), where the court ruled that under New Jersey property law ownership of real property did not include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers, in this case a publicly funded non-profit lawyer attempting to advise migrant workers; Uston v. Resorts International, 445 A. 2d 370 (New Jersey, 1982), a New Jersey case concerning casinos where the court held that when property owners open their premises to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably (although it was acknowledged that the private law of most States did not require a right of reasonable access to privately owned property, p. 374); and Streetwatch v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 875 F. Supp. (West\u2019s Federal Supplement) 1055 (Southern District of New York, 1995) concerning the ejection of homeless people from a railway station.\n30. States in which courts ruled that free speech provisions in their constitutions did not apply to privately owned shopping centres included Arizona (Fiesta Mall Venture v. Mecham Recall Comm., 767 P. 2d 719 (Court of Appeals, 1989)); Connecticut (Cologne v. Westfarms Assocs, 469 A. 2d 1201 (1984)); Georgia (Citizens for Ethical Gov\u2019t v. Gwinnet Place Assoc., 392 S.E. (West\u2019s South Eastern Reporter) 2d 8 (1990)); Michigan (Woodland v. Michigan Citizens Lobby, 378 N.W. 2d 337 (1985)); Minnesota (State of Minnesota v. Wicklund et al., 7 April 1998 (Court of Appeals)); North Carolina (State of North Carolina v. Felmet, 273 S.E. 2d 708 (1981)); Ohio (Eastwood Mall v. Slanco, 626 N.E. 2d 59 (1994)); Pennsylvania (Western Pa Socialist Workers 1982 Campaign v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 515 A. 2d 1331 (1986)); South Carolina (Charleston Joint Venture v. McPherson, 417 S.E. 2d 544 (1992)); Washington (Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., cited above; and Wisconsin (Jacobs v. Major, 407 N.W. 2d 832 (1987)).\n#### B. Canada\n31. Prior to the entry into force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Supreme Court had taken the view that the owner of a shopping centre could exclude protesters (Harrison v. Carswell, 62 D.L.R. (Dominion Law Reports) 3d 68 (1975)). After the Charter entered into force, a lower court held that the right to free speech applied in privately owned shopping centres (R. v. Layton, 38 C.C.C. (Canadian Criminal Cases) 3d 550 (1986) (Provincial Court, Judicial District of York, Ontario)). However, an individual judge of the Canadian Supreme Court has since expressed the opposite view, stating obiter that the Charter does not confer a right to use private property as a forum of expression (McLachlin J, Committee for Cth of Can. v. Canada [1991] 1 SCR (Canada Supreme Court Reports) 139, 228).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. Article 10 of the Convention provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n33. The applicants submitted that the State was directly responsible for the interference with their freedom of expression and assembly as it was a public entity that had built the Galleries on public land and a minister who had approved the transfer into private ownership. The local authority could have required that the purchaser enter into a walkways agreement, which would have extended by-law protection to access ways, but did not do so.\n34. The applicants also argued that the State owed a positive obligation to secure the exercise of their rights within the Galleries. As the information and ideas which they wished to communicate were of a political nature, their expression was entitled to the greatest level of protection. Access to the town centre was essential for the exercise of those rights as it was the most effective way of communicating their ideas to the population, as was shown by the fact that the local authority itself used the Galleries to promote a political proposal regarding the reorganisation of local government. Yet, the applicants had been refused permission to use the Galleries to express their opposition to local government action, showing that the private owner was not neutral in its decisions as to who should be given permission. The finding of an obligation would impose no significant financial burden on the State as it was merely under a duty to put in place a legal framework which provided effective protection for their rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly by balancing those rights against the rights of the property owner, as already existed in a number of areas. They considered that no proper balance had been struck as protection was afforded to property owners, who wielded an absolute discretion as to who should have access to their land, while no regard was given to individuals seeking to exercise their individual rights.\n35. The applicants submitted that it was for the State to decide how to remedy this shortcoming and that any purported definitional problems and difficulties of application could be resolved by carefully drafted legislation. A definition of \u201cquasi-public\u201d land could be proposed that excluded, for example, theatres. They also referred to case-law from other jurisdictions (in particular the United States) where concepts of reasonable access or limitations on arbitrary exclusion powers of landowners were being developed, inter alia, in the context of shopping malls and university campuses, which gave an indication of how the State could approach the perceived problems.\n##### 2. The Government\n36. The Government submitted that at the relevant time the town centre was owned by a private company, Postel, and that it was Postel, in the exercise of its rights as property owner, which refused the applicants permission to use the Galleries for their activities. They argued that, in those circumstances, the State could not be regarded as bearing direct responsibility for any interference with the applicants\u2019 exercise of their rights. The fact that the land had previously been owned by the local authority was irrelevant.\n37. In so far as the applicants claimed that the State\u2019s positive obligation to secure their rights was engaged, the Government acknowledged that positive obligations were capable of arising under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. However, such obligations did not arise in the present case, having regard to a number of factors. The alleged breach did not have a serious impact on the applicants, who had many other opportunities of exercising their rights and used them to obtain thousands of signatures on their petition as a result. The burden imposed on the State by the finding of a positive obligation would also be a heavy one. When selling land, local authorities were not under any duty to enter into walkways agreements to render access areas subject to by-law regulation. The State\u2019s ability to comply with such an obligation by entering into that type of agreement when selling State-owned land would depend entirely on obtaining the cooperation of the private-sector purchaser, who might reasonably not want to allow any form of canvassing on his land and might feel that customers of commercial services would be deterred by the presence of political canvassers, religious activists, animal rights campaigners, etc.\n38. Furthermore, a fair balance had been struck between the competing interests in this case. The applicants, in the Government\u2019s view only looked at one side of the balancing exercise, whereas legitimate objections could be raised by property owners if they were required to allow people to exercise their freedom of expression or assembly on their land, when means of exercising those rights were widely available on genuinely public land and in the media. As the facts of this case illustrated, the applicants could canvass support in public places, on the streets, in squares and on common land, they could canvass from door to door or by post, and they could write letters to the newspapers or speak on radio and television. The Government argued that it was not for the Court to prescribe the necessary content of domestic law by imposing some ill-defined concept of \u201cquasi-public\u201d land to which a test of reasonable access should be applied. That no problems arose from the balance struck in this case was shown by the fact that no serious controversy had arisen to date. The cases from the United States and Canada referred to by the applicants were not relevant, as they dealt with different legal provisions and different factual situations and, in any event, did not show any predominant trend in requiring special regimes to attach to \u201cquasi-public\u201d land.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles\n39. The Court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy. Genuine, effective exercise of this freedom does not depend merely on the State\u2019s duty not to interfere, but may require positive measures of protection, even in the sphere of relations between individuals (see \u00d6zg\u00fcr G\u00fcndem v. Turkey, no. 23144/93, \u00a7\u00a7 42-46, ECHR 2000-III, where the Turkish State was found to be under a positive obligation to take investigative and protective measures where the pro-PKK newspaper and its journalists and staff had been the victims of a campaign of violence and intimidation; see also Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000, concerning the obligation on the State to protect freedom of expression in the employment context).\n40. In determining whether or not a positive obligation exists, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual, the search for which is inherent throughout the Convention. The scope of this obligation will inevitably vary, having regard to the diversity of situations obtaining in Contracting States and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources. Nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (see, inter alia, Rees v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, p. 15, \u00a7 37, and Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII, pp. 3159-60, \u00a7 116).\n##### 2. Application in the present case\n41. The applicants were stopped from setting up a stand and distributing leaflets in the Galleries by Postel, the private company which owned the shopping centre. The Court does not find that the authorities bear any direct responsibility for this restriction on the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression. It is not persuaded that any element of State responsibility can be derived from the fact that a public development corporation transferred the property to Postel or that this was done with ministerial permission. The issue to be determined is whether the respondent State has failed in any positive obligation to protect the exercise of the applicants\u2019 Article 10 rights from interference by others \u2013 in this case, the owner of the Galleries.\n42. The nature of the Convention right at stake is an important consideration.\n43. The Court notes that the applicants wished to draw the attention of their fellow citizens to their opposition to the plans of the local authority to develop a playing field and thus to deprive their children of green areas to play in. This was a topic of public interest and contributed to debate about the exercise of local government powers. However, while freedom of expression is an important right, it is not unlimited. Nor is it the only Convention right at stake. Regard must also be had to the property rights of the owner of the shopping centre under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n44. The Court has noted the applicants\u2019 arguments and the references to the United States cases, which draw attention to the way in which shopping centres, although their purpose is primarily the pursuit of private commercial interests, are designed increasingly to serve as gathering places and events centres, with multiple activities concentrated within their boundaries. Frequently, individuals are not merely invited to shop but encouraged to linger and participate in a wide range of activities \u2013 from entertainment to community, educational and charitable events. Such shopping centres may assume the characteristics of the traditional town centre and indeed, in this case, the Galleries is labelled on maps as the town centre and either contains, or is close to, public services and facilities. As a result, the applicants argued that the shopping centre must be regarded as a \u201cquasi-public\u201d space in which individuals can claim the right to exercise freedom of expression in a reasonable manner.\n45. The Government have disputed the usefulness or coherence of employing definitions of \u201cquasi-public\u201d spaces and pointed to the difficulties which would ensue if places open to the public, such as theatres or museums, were required to allow free access for purposes other than the cultural activities they offered.\n46. The Court would observe that, although the cases from the United States in particular illustrate an interesting trend in accommodating freedom of expression to privately owned property open to the public, the Supreme Court has refrained from holding that there is a federal constitutional right of free speech in a privately owned shopping mall. Authorities from the individual States show a variety of approaches to the public- and private-law issues that have arisen in widely differing factual situations. It cannot be said that there is as yet any emerging consensus that could assist the Court in its examination in this case concerning Article 10 of the Convention.\n47. That provision, notwithstanding the acknowledged importance of freedom of expression, does not bestow any freedom of forum for the exercise of that right. While it is true that demographic, social, economic and technological developments are changing the ways in which people move around and come into contact with each other, the Court is not persuaded that this requires the automatic creation of rights of entry to private property, or even, necessarily, to all publicly owned property (government offices and ministries, for instance). Where, however, the bar on access to property has the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression or it can be said that the essence of the right has been destroyed, the Court would not exclude that a positive obligation could arise for the State to protect the enjoyment of the Convention rights by regulating property rights. A corporate town where the entire municipality is controlled by a private body might be an example (see Marsh v. Alabama, cited at paragraph 26 above).\n48. In the present case, the restriction on the applicants\u2019 ability to communicate their views was limited to the entrance areas and passageways of the Galleries. It did not prevent them from obtaining individual permission from businesses within the Galleries (the manager of a hypermarket granted permission for a stand within his store on one occasion) or from distributing their leaflets on the public access paths into the area. It also remained open to them to campaign in the old town centre and to employ alternative means, such as calling door-to-door or seeking exposure in the local press, radio and television. The applicants did not deny that these other methods were available to them. Their argument, essentially, was that the easiest and most effective method of reaching people was to use the Galleries, as shown by the local authority\u2019s own information campaign (see paragraph 21 above). The Court does not consider, however, that the applicants can claim that they were, as a result of the refusal of the private company, Postel, effectively prevented from communicating their views to their fellow citizens. Some 3,200 people submitted letters in support. Whether more would have done so if the stand had remained in the Galleries is speculation which is insufficient to support an argument that the applicants were unable otherwise to exercise their freedom of expression in a meaningful manner.\n49. Balancing the rights in issue and having regard to the nature and scope of the restriction in this case, the Court does not find that the respondent State failed in any positive obligation to protect the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression.\n50. Consequently, there has been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 11 OF THE CONVENTION\n51. The relevant parts of Article 11 of the Convention provide:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others ...\n2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.\u201d\n52. The Court finds that largely identical considerations arise under this provision as were examined above under Article 10 of the Convention. For the same reasons, it also finds no failure to protect the applicants\u2019 freedom of assembly and, accordingly, no violation of Article 11 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n53. Article 13 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n54. The applicants submitted that they had no remedy for their complaints, which disclosed arguable claims of violations of provisions of the Convention. Domestic law provided at that time no remedy to test whether any interference with their rights was unlawful. The case-law of the English courts indicated that the owner of a shopping centre could give a bad reason, or no reason at all, for the exclusion of individuals from its land. No judicial review would lie against the decision of such a private entity.\n55. The Government accepted that, if contrary to their arguments, the State\u2019s positive obligations were engaged and there was an unjustified interference under Articles 10 or 11 of the Convention, there was no remedy available to the applicants in domestic law.\n56. The case-law of the Convention institutions indicates, however, that Article 13 cannot be interpreted as requiring a remedy against the state of domestic law, as otherwise the Court would be imposing on Contracting States a requirement to incorporate the Convention (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p. 47, \u00a7 85). In so far, therefore, as no remedy existed in domestic law prior to 2 October 2000 when the Human Rights Act 1998 took effect, the applicants\u2019 complaints fall foul of this principle. Following that date, it would have been possible for the applicants to raise their complaints before the domestic courts, which would have had a range of possible redress available to them.\n57. In these circumstances, the Court finds no breach of Article 13 of the Convention in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention;\n2. Holds by six votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 11 of the Convention;\n3. Holds unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 6 May 2003, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the partly dissenting opinion of Mr Maruste is annexed to this judgment.\nM.P.\nM.O\u2019B.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MARUSTE\nTo my regret I am unable to share the finding of the majority of the Chamber that the applicants\u2019 rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention were not infringed. In my view, the property rights of the owners of the shopping mall were unnecessarily given priority over the applicants\u2019 freedom of expression and assembly.\nThe case raises the important issue of the State\u2019s positive obligations in a modern liberal society where many traditionally State-owned services like post, transport, energy, health and community services and others have been or could be privatised. In this situation, should private owners\u2019 property rights prevail over other rights or does the State still have some responsibility to secure the proper balance between private and public interests?\nThe new town centre was planned and built originally by a body set up by the government (see paragraph 11 of the judgment). At a later stage the shopping centre was privatised. The area was huge, with many shops and hypermarkets, and also included car parks and walkways. Because of its central nature, several important public services like the public library, the social services office, the health centre and even the police station were also located in or near to the centre. Through specific actions and decisions, the public authorities and public money were involved and there was an active presence of public agencies in the vicinity. That means that the public authorities also bore some responsibility for decisions about the nature of the area and access to and use of it.\nThere is no doubt that the area in its functional nature and essence is a forum publicum or \u201cquasi-public\u201d space, as argued by the applicants and clearly recognised also by the Chamber (see paragraph 44 of the judgment). The place as such is not something which has belonged to the owners for ages. This was a new creation where public interests and money were and still are involved. That is why the situation is clearly distinguishable from the \u201cmy home is my castle\u201d type of situation.\nAlthough the applicants were not complaining about unequal treatment, it is evident that they had justified expectations of being able to use the area as a public gathering area and to have access to the public and its services on an equal footing with other groups, including local government (see paragraphs 20 and 34 of the judgment) who had used the place for similar purposes without any restrictions.\nThe applicants sought access to the public to discuss with them a topic of a public, not private, nature and to contribute to the debate about the exercise of local government powers \u2013 in other words, for entirely lawful purposes. They acted as others did, without disturbing the public peace or interfering with business by other unacceptable or disruptive methods.\nIn these circumstances, it is hard to agree with the Chamber\u2019s finding that the authorities bear no direct responsibility for the restrictions applied to the applicants. In a strict and formal sense that is true. But it does not mean that there were no indirect responsibilities. It cannot be the case that through privatisation the public authorities can divest themselves of all responsibility to protect rights and freedoms other than property rights. They still bear responsibility for deciding how the forum created by them is to be used and for ensuring that public interests and individuals\u2019 rights are respected. It is in the public interest to permit reasonable exercise of individual rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech and assembly on the property of a privately owned shopping centre, and not to make some public services and institutions inaccessible to the public and participants in demonstrations. The Court has consistently held that, if there is a conflict between rights and freedoms, the freedom of expression takes precedence. But in this case it appears to be the other way round \u2013 property rights prevailed over freedom of speech.\nOf course, it would clearly be too far-reaching to say that no limitations can be put on the exercise of rights and freedoms on private land or premises. They should be exercised in a manner consistent with respect for owners\u2019 rights too. And that is exactly what the Chamber did not take into account in this case. The public authorities did not carry out a balancing exercise and did not regulate how the privately owned forum publicum was to be used in the public interest. The old traditional rule that the private owner has an unfettered right to eject people from his land and premises without giving any justification and without any test of reasonableness being applied is no longer fully adapted to contemporary conditions and society. Consequently, the State failed to discharge its positive obligations under Articles 10 and 11.", "001-60649": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF BENJAMIN and WILSON v.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 5 September 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Transfer and restriction directions on prisoners under the Mental Health Act 1983\n19. Under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d), the Secretary of State may transfer a person serving a sentence of imprisonment to hospital if he is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment, and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, and, in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition. A transfer under section 47 of the 1983 Act is called a \u201ctransfer direction\u201d, and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under section 37 (1) of the 1983 Act (that is, where a court convicts a person and, instead of sentencing him, orders his detention in hospital).\n20. At the same time as making a transfer direction, the Secretary of State may also make a \u201crestriction direction\u201d under section 49 of the 1983 Act. A restriction direction has the same effect as a restriction order made by a court under section 41 of the 1983 Act on conviction, save that because the person was not given a hospital order by the court, the Secretary of State must consent to his discharge from hospital, as well as to the granting of leave of absence or transfer to another hospital.\n21. A transferred life prisoner subject to restriction directions can be discharged from hospital in three possible ways. Each can be initiated only by the Secretary of State.\n(1) Section 42 (2) of the 1983 Act gives the Secretary of State power, if he thinks fit, by warrant to discharge the patient either absolutely or subject to conditions.\n(2) Section 50 of the 1983 Act provides that where the Secretary of State is notified by the responsible medical officer, and other registered practitioner or a Mental Health Review Tribunal that the person no longer requires treatment in hospital for mental disorder, or that no effective treatment for the disorder can be given in the hospital, the Secretary of State may remit the person to a prison or to a different institution, or he may exercise any power of releasing or discharging him which would have been exercisable if he had been so remitted.\n(3) Under Section 74 of the 1983 Act,\n\u201c(1) Where an application to a Mental Health Review Tribunal is made by a restricted patient who is subject to a restriction direction, or where the case of such a patient is referred to such a tribunal, the tribunal -\n(a) shall notify the Secretary of State whether, in their opinion, the patient would, if subject to a restriction order, be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged under Section 73 ...; and\n(b) if they notify him that the patient would be entitled to be conditionally discharged, may recommend that in the event of his not being discharged under this section he should continue to be detained in hospital.\n(2) If in the case of a patient not falling within subsection (4) below-\n(a) the tribunal notify the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged; and\n(b) within the period of 90 days beginning with the date of that notification the Secretary of State gives notice to the tribunal that the patient may be so discharged,\nthe tribunal shall direct the absolute or, as the case may be, the conditional discharge of the patient.\n...\n(4) If, in the case of a patient who is subject to a transfer direction under Section 48 above, the tribunal notify the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged, the Secretary of State shall, unless the tribunal have made a recommendation under subsection (1)(b) above, by warrant direct that the patient be remitted to a prison or other institution in which he might have been detained if he had not been removed to hospital, there to be dealt with as if he had not been so removed.\u201d\n22. Section 73 of the 1983 Act (which relates to restricted patients under section 41 of the 1983 Act) provides that the tribunal must direct conditional discharge if they are satisfied that he is not suffering from mental illness or disorder of a type which makes it appropriate for the person to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, or that it is not necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment, and they believe that it is appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment.\n23. In 1985, the Home Secretary announced that life sentence prisoners who had been transferred to hospital would normally be discharged under section 50 of the 1983 Act rather than sections 42 (2) or 74 (2). This enables release on life licence with life-long control rather than the possibility of eventual absolute discharge by the Secretary of State. The policy was found to be lawful in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Stroud (16 July 1992).\n#### B. Discretionary life prisoners\n24. Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides that where a discretionary life prisoner has served his tariff (that is, the \u201cpunishment\u201d part of his sentence), and the Parole Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be detained and has directed his release, it is the duty of the Secretary of State to release him. Under Paragraph 9 of Schedule 12, which is a transitional provision to the 1991 Act, the Secretary of State can apply the provisions of section 34 to discretionary life prisoners who were sentenced before section 34 of the 1991 Act came into force on 10 October 1992 by issuing a certificate that, if the 1991 Act had been in force when the person was sentenced, section 34 would have been applied.\n#### C. The Human Rights Act 1998\n25. On 2 October 2000 the Human Rights Act came into force in England and Wales. Section 6 provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Sub-section (1) does not apply to an act if \u2013\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect to in a way which is compatible with Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicants complained that they did not have a review of their continued detention in hospital as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The relevant provisions of Article 5 are as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The applicants\n27. The applicants submitted that as they should never have been sent to prison but should have been sent to hospital, their detention fell to be justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1(e) of the Convention and they were entitled under Article 5 \u00a7 4 to a review by a body empowered to examine the lawfulness of their detention and to direct their release into the community if they were no longer detainable on grounds of mental disorder.\n28. The system to which they were subject as \u201ctechnical lifers\u201d, whereby the Tribunal could only make recommendations for release, did not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4. The fact that, as claimed by the Government, a recommendation would as a matter of policy be accepted by the Secretary of State was not a sufficient guarantee. Such policies could be changed, and it was extremely doubtful that the Secretary of State could administratively bind himself (referring to R. v. North East Devon Health Authority ex parte Coughlan [2002] 2 WLR 622). The Secretary of State was left with sole power to determine not only whether to grant release but also when to do it and on what conditions.\n29. The applicants accepted that under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State was bound as a matter of law to follow the recommendation for discharge of any tribunals that might review the applicants' detention. However it remained the case that the Secretary of State was free to resile from the policy of identifying certain life sentence prisoners as \u201ctechnical lifers\u201d or of treating the applicants as such. Insofar therefore as the applicants did not have a right in law to an Article 5 \u00a7 4 compliant review but only one that was granted administratively, there was an ongoing violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4.\n##### 2. The Government\n30. The Government submitted that there had been no breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 as the applicants were legally entitled to release when and if the MHR Tribunal so recommended. They were entitled to have the merits of their continuing detention considered by the Tribunal, which had the power to recommend release and was independent. While it had no power to order release, this was a matter of form not substance as in the case of technical lifers such as the applicants the practice and policy of the Secretary of State was to follow the recommendation of the Tribunal under section 74 of the 1983 Act in relation to discharge. They argued that compliance with Article 5 \u00a7 4 could be achieved by administrative practice and policy, citing the cases of Leander v. Sweden (judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, \u00a7 51) and Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89).\n31. Furthermore, the applicants were legally protected as it would be unlawful for the Secretary of State not to comply with his own policy, which created legitimate expectations. They had not suggested that the Tribunal had made any recommendation which the Secretary of State had refused to accept. In particular, since the Human Rights Act 1998, he would not be entitled to change his policy on \u201ctechnical lifers\u201d without complying with Convention rights and so a remedy would be available under section 6(1) of the Act.\n32. In any event, the Government pointed out that the Tribunal had not recommended the release of either applicant before the introduction of this application and so neither had been prejudiced by its inability to order release. Insofar as the first applicant has now been discharged from hospital, this was in accordance with the recommendation of the Tribunal. Neither could therefore claim to be a victim of any breach of the Convention.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n33. Article 5 \u00a7 4 provides a crucial guarantee against the arbitrariness of detention, providing for detained persons to obtain a review by a court of the lawfulness of their detention both at the time of the initial deprivation of liberty and, where new issues of lawfulness are capable of arising, periodically thereafter (see, inter alia, Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, \u00a7 123, and Varbanov v. Bulgaria, no. 31365/96, ECHR 2000-X, \u00a7 58). While the \u201ccourt\u201d referred to in this provision does not necessarily have to be a court of law of the classic kind integrated within the judicial machinery of the country, it does denote bodies which exhibit the necessary judicial procedures and safeguards appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question, including most importantly independence of the executive and of the parties (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, pp. 41-42, \u00a7\u00a7 76 and 86; X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, p. 23, \u00a7 53, and Weeks v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, p. 30, \u00a7 61).\n34. In addition, as the text makes clear, the body in question must have not merely advisory functions but must have the competence to \u201cdecide\u201d the \u201clawfulness\u201d of the detention and to order release if the detention is unlawful (see the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, loc. cit., Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports 1996-I, \u00a7 66, D.N. v. Switzerland, [GC], no. 27154/95, ECHR 2001-III, \u00a7 39).\n35. It is not contested in the present case that the applicants who were both detained in a hospital at the introduction of this application had the possibility of having their continued detention reviewed by the MHR Tribunal which satisfied the requirement of independence. It did not however have the power to order release.\n36. The Government argued that as the Secretary of State followed a practice of following the Tribunal's recommendation this did not deprive the Tribunal's review of an effective decision-making function. While they have referred to previous cases concerning the relevance of administrative practices and policies, the Court observes that these judgments examined complaints under Article 8 of the Convention where issues arose as to whether certain measures were \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d. In that context, the existence of administrative practices may indeed have a bearing on the conditions of lawfulness of measures. Under Article 5 \u00a7 4 however, the plain wording of the provision refers to the decision-making power of the reviewing body. In this case, the power to order release lay with the Secretary of State, even though he may have been under some constraints of administrative law as regarded the situations in which he could or could not depart from a policy that had created legitimate expectations. The ability of an applicant to challenge a refusal by the Secretary of State to follow his previous policy in the courts would not remedy the lack of power of decision in the Tribunal. Article 5 \u00a7 4 presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its provisions without the necessity to institute separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about. Similarly, although both parties appear to agree that the Secretary of State, following entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, would not be able lawfully to depart from the Tribunal's recommendation, this does not alter the fact that the decision to release would be taken by a member of the executive and not by the Tribunal. This is not a matter of form but impinges on the fundamental principle of separation of powers and detracts from a necessary guarantee against the possibility of abuse (see, mutatis mutandis, Stafford v. the United Kingdom, [GC] no. 46295/ 99, 28 May 2002, ECHR 2002-..., \u00a7 78).\n37. Nor does the Court accept the Government's argument that the applicants cannot claim to be victims, the first applicant since he has been released when the Tribunal so recommended and the second applicant as his release has never been recommended. Both applicants, the first applicant until the date of his release in January 2001, were entitled to have a review of the lawfulness of their continued detention by a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 4. As the Tribunal could not order the release of the applicants, they were not able to obtain such a review.\n38. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n39. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n40. The applicants make no claim for damage, accepting that a finding of a violation would constitute just satisfaction in the circumstances of their case. Nor have they submitted any claims for legal costs.\nIn the circumstances, the Court makes no award.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 26 September 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nVincent Berger Ireneu Cabral Barreto\nRegistrar President", "001-60736": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SALOMONSSON v.

Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr M. Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n23. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK).\n#### B. Procedure\n24. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court.\n25. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n26. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n27. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court had constituted a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n29. The Government claimed that it had been justified to dispense with an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case. They contended that a hearing would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they submitted that the case had concerned purely medical issues or issues closely related to such issues. They pointed out that the applicant wished to be heard in person before the Administrative Court of Appeal about his working conditions and the costs of his consumption of fluids. However, he had been on early retirement since 1989. Furthermore, all the relevant evidence in the case had been in writing. The judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s need of fluids due to his handicap by meeting him in person but had had to rely on the written medical evidence submitted in the case. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing his case in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under a social-insurance scheme, no questions of public interest had been involved.\n30. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold an oral hearing and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing, he had, at least tacitly, waived his right to have his case heard in public before that judicial instance.\n##### 2. The applicant\n31. The applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. He stated that the case had not concerned purely medical issues but had rather concerned the amount of the applicant\u2019s extra costs. This amount could not be derived from the opinions given in the medical certificates. Rather, the applicant had been the only one to give that kind of information and an account of his personal situation. It had therefore been indispensable to hold a hearing in order to complete the case file in these respects. Moreover, the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal disagreed on the issue whether the applicant\u2019s costs were such that he was entitled to the disability benefits requested. Thus, his case had been of a borderline nature which had further emphasised the need for an oral hearing.\n32. The applicant also found it remarkable that the appellate court had considered a hearing to be unnecessary without giving any further reasons. He therefore could not assess whether the decisions had been in compliance with the 1971 Act.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n33. Noting that the Government have not disputed the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to the case at hand, the Court observes that the proceedings at issue concerned the applicant\u2019s claim to benefits under a social-security scheme. The purpose of the proceedings was to obtain a decision in a dispute over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, and they accordingly fall within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53).\n##### 2. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1\n34. The Court first finds that the entitlement to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 necessarily implies a right to an \u201coral hearing\u201d. However, the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be done explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\nFurthermore, a hearing may not be necessary due to exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201111, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; and Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 44).\n35. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant did not request a hearing before the County Administrative Court. As Section 9 of the 1971 Act provided that the proceedings before the administrative courts were normally in writing, the applicant could have been expected to request a hearing before that court if he attached importance to it. He did not do so, however, and the Court therefore finds that he can reasonably be considered to have waived his right to a hearing before the County Administrative Court.\nMoreover, the Supreme Administrative Court only determined whether or not leave to appeal should be granted and, as a consequence of its refusal to grant leave, did not make a full examination of the applicant\u2019s case. Even assuming that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to the determination of this question, the Court finds that it could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the written submissions and that, accordingly, the absence of an oral hearing before the Supreme Administrative Court was justified.\n36. It remains to be determined whether the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal involved a breach of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance there is normally a right to a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment cited above, p. 20, \u00a7 64). However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36). Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance.\n37. The Court notes that no hearing was held at first instance since the applicant did not request the County Administrative Court to hold one. It acknowledges that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing is held already at first instance rather than only before the appellate court. Depending on the circumstances of the case, it might therefore be acceptable to reject a request for a hearing upon appeal, although no such hearing has been held at first instance.\n38. The Court further recognises that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\n39. In the applicant\u2019s case, the Court observes that the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not limited to matters of law but also extended to factual issues. As noted by the County Administrative Court, the main issue in the case was whether the applicant\u2019s extra costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. It is true that the written medical evidence was of considerable importance to the determination of this issue. However, the physicians giving their opinion in the case were not in agreement; as regards the applicant\u2019s consumption of fluids, two of them considered that his handicap necessitated an increased consumption whereas the other two contended that there was no such need. In requesting an oral hearing, the applicant stated that he wished to be heard about, inter alia, the costs of his consumption of fluids. In these circumstances, it appears that an oral hearing could have provided information of relevance to the determination of the case.\nThe Court also notes that the Administrative Court of Appeal found against the applicant whereas the County Administrative Court had given judgment in the applicant\u2019s favour, having found that the medical evidence was inconclusive and that, even according to the Office\u2019s calculation, the applicant\u2019s extra costs were close to the level required for entitlement to a disability allowance.\n40. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court cannot find that there were exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with a hearing. Having expressly requested an oral hearing in the Administrative Court of Appeal, the applicant was thus entitled to such a hearing before that instance.\nThe refusal by the Administrative Court of Appeal to hold an oral hearing amounted therefore to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n41. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Legislative amendment\n42. The applicant asked the Court to order the Swedish Government to undertake a reform of the law by which it should \u201ctake measures to preclude the occurrence of breaches of the Convention, such as occurred in respect of the applicant, in the future\u201d.\n43. The Government maintained that legislative measures did not fall within the scope of Article 41 of the Convention.\n44. The Court notes that the Convention does not empower it to order a State to alter its legislation; the Court\u2019s judgment leaves to the State the choice of the means to be used in its domestic legal system to give effect to its obligation under Article 46 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Belilos v. Switzerland, judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 33, \u00a7 78).\n#### B. Damage\n45. The applicant submitted that he had sustained pecuniary damage in that the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment in his favour would not have been quashed by the Administrative Court of Appeal had the latter held an oral hearing in the case. He estimated that loss at SEK 77,070 until the end of July 2000.\n46. The Government contended that there was no causal link between a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and the applicant\u2019s claim for pecuniary damages.\n47. The Court rejects the applicant\u2019s claim as it cannot speculate as to the outcome of the proceedings had a hearing taken place before the appellate court.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n48. The applicant claimed SEK 18,750, including value-added tax (VAT), in legal fees for the domestic proceedings and SEK 85,000, excluding VAT, in legal fees and translation costs for the proceedings before the Commission and the Court. The legal fees corresponded to 18.75 hours of work for the applicant\u2019s first counsel in the domestic proceedings as well as 58 and 10 hours of work, respectively, for the two counsel in those before the Convention organs.\n49. The Government considered the number of hours of work stated by the applicant to be excessive. Noting that the invoices submitted were not specified and that the translation costs were not supported by any documentation, they submitted that the legal fees incurred in the domestic proceedings seemed to relate to the case as a whole and not only to work pertaining to the requests for an oral hearing. As regards the work undertaken in the proceedings before the Convention organs, the Government pointed out that part of the application had been declared inadmissible by the Court on 4 May 2000 and contended that the change of counsel had entailed additional costs. If the Court were to find a violation in regard to the question of an oral hearing, they regarded as appropriate the award of a sum not exceeding SEK 28,500 in respect of costs and expenses.\n50. The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, T.P. and K.M. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 28945/95, 10 May 2001, \u00a7 120). Moreover, compensation for costs incurred in the domestic proceedings may only be granted in so far as they were necessary in trying to prevent the violation found (see K\u00f6nig v. Germany (Article 50), judgment of 10 March 1980, Series A no. 36, p. 17, \u00a7 20). In the present case, the Court finds that only a smaller part of the stated costs incurred in the domestic proceedings can be considered to relate to the issue of an oral hearing. As regards the proceedings before the Convention organs, it further takes into account that the translation costs have not been substantiated and that the applicant was only partially successful with his application. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant by way of costs and expenses the global sum of EUR 5,000, including VAT.\n#### D. Default interest\n51. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points (see Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], application no. 28957, \u00a7 124, to be published in ECHR 2002).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal;\n##### 2. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 November 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President\nN.B.\nM.O\u2019B.", "001-59098": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF QUINN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Pertinent Constitutional provisions\n17. Article 38(1) of the Irish Constitution provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. By Article 40, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.\n#### B. The Offences Against the State Act 1939\n18. The Offences Against the State Act 1939 (\u201cthe 1939 Act\u201d) is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts.\n19. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act.\n20. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances\u2019 legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date.\n22. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act.\n23. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the [police] may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person\u2019s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.\n2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the [police], fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\u201d\n24. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the Government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has, with Government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The Committee has commenced its work.\n#### C. Relevant case-law\n25. In the case of the People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan (1979 IR 45) the accused had been arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act and had made certain statements to the police. The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest (section 30), the existence of section 52 of the 1939 Act and even though no section 52 requests had actually been made, the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements. Accordingly, the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible. The Court did not find this argument persuasive since no section 52 requests had in fact been made. It went to point out that, even if section 52 had been invoked by the police, the defence submission was not well-founded because of previous Irish case-law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with Irish law, even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer, were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings.\n26. The Garda Siochana (police) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in association with the Garda Siochana. The commentary on section 52 of the 1939 Act in the sixth edition (1991) provides as follows:\n\u201cThe fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section 52 does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence\u201d\nThe judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the above-cited McGowan case and the earlier Irish case-law approved in the McGowan case.\n27. In the case of Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General ([1994] 2 ILRM), two individuals had been sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act for failing to give an account of their movements. The High Court rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of section 52, considering that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with those persons\u2019 right to silence guaranteed by Article 38 of the Constitution: the objective was to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State; the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational; and other legal protections were available to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act which minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act.\nThose protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligatory informing of the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act.\nThe Supreme Court rejected the appeal (Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General [1996] IR 580). It noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the question of the later use of statements made pursuant to requests of the police under that section. While it noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in the above-cited McGowan case that information lawfully obtained under Section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not.\nThe Supreme Court pointed out that the right to silence was a corollary to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. The relevant assessment was, therefore, to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made under section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force.\nAs to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those, with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime, to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order.\n28. In the case of National Irish Bank Ltd (In the matter of National Irish Bank Ltd and the Companies Act 1990, 1999 1 ILRM 321, at 343) the Supreme Court found that a confession of a bank official obtained by Inspectors as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under Section 10 of the Companies Act 1990 would not, in general, be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless, in any particular case, the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary. The Supreme Court considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under section 52 of the 1939 Act would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.\nTHE LAW\ni. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that section 52 of the 1939 Act violated his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. Article 6, in so far as is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...\n2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s submissions\n30. The Government submitted, in the first place, that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. He had, for reasons outlined by the Government, a fair trial in respect of his conviction under section 52 of the 1939 Act. Since Article 6 provides protection of a procedural nature for the determination of a criminal charge, the applicant could not rely on Article 6 to challenge the offence under section 52 itself. In addition, no proceedings were taken against him on charges of membership of an illegal organisation so that he could not, in that respect, complain of a violation of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government also disputed that the applicant could be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 as interpreted by the Serves judgment: the applicant had assumed wrongly that, when he was questioned under section 52, a case existed against him which the police sought to prove as in the Serves case. When questions were put to the present applicant under section 52, no decision had been taken to charge him with any particular crime.\n31. Secondly, the Government pointed to substantial safeguards which exist in order to minimise the risk that an individual may wrongfully confess to a crime, which safeguards were listed by the High Court in the above-cited Heaney and McGuinness case (see paragraph 27 above).\n32. Thirdly, the Government maintained that section 52 of the 1939 Act was a reasonable and appropriate measure given that that section did not provide for, or allow the use, in subsequent criminal proceedings against an accused of information obtained involuntarily from that person.\nIf there had been cases where information obtained pursuant to section 52 had been later introduced in evidence against the accused, the Government could not find any such case. They pointed out that the statement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the above-cited McGowan case on which the applicant relied was obiter dictum since no section 52 requests had been made in that case. In any event, the matter had been clarified for the future by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the above-cited National Irish Bank Ltd case of January 1999. That court found that compelling a person to confess and then convicting him on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. It also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of section 52 statements would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial only if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.\n33. Fourthly, the Government also considered that section 52 of the 1939 Act was a proportionate response given the security situation pertaining in the Irish State relating to Northern Ireland and the consequent concerns to ensure the effective administration of justice and to preserve public peace and order.\nThe Government maintained that, as it is legitimate to impose sanctions in civil matters (such as, for example, taxation matters) when a citizen does not divulge information, the power to obtain information under threat of sanction is all the more necessary in criminal matters where the information sought could be essential for the investigation of serious and subversive crime. The Government recalled that the arrest of the applicant took place in the context of police enquiries consequent on the serious attack in Adare which had been established as having been carried out by an IRA unit.\nThe Government emphasised that section 52 of the 1939 Act remained in force only as long as a proclamation under section 35 of the 1939 Act was in force. As such, section 52 was a part of Irish law only as long as it was considered warranted by a subsisting terrorist and security threat. The Government summarised the duration and level of violence to the date of their observations and detailed recent bombings and other atrocities, referred to a public statement in December 1999 of the Continuity IRA (who are committed to continuing an armed campaign) and outlined recent weapons, explosives and vehicle bomb seizures. Consequently, they considered that the maintenance of the section 35 proclamation continued to be necessary. This necessity had been constantly reviewed, most recently in March 1998, when it was decided to maintain the proclamation in force, the Government noting, in this context, that the single worst atrocity of the entire period of the proclamation occurred in August 1998 when 29 persons lost their lives in a bombing in Omagh. The Government also referred to their commitment as regards the Offences Against the State Acts in the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998.\nMoreover, the use of section 52 of the 1939 was strictly limited to arrests and detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and the circumstances in which section 30 of the 1939 Act came into play were, in turn, strictly limited. The domestic courts were, in addition, vigilant in ensuring that the arrest powers under section 30 were not abused or used for improper purposes (The People (D.P.P.) v. Quilligan and O\u2019Reilly 1986 IR 495 and The State (Trimbole) v. the Governor of Mountjoy Prison 1985 IR 550).\n34. Finally, the Government distinguished the Saunders v. the United Kingdom judgment (of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, no. 24) on the basis that the Court condemned the use at trial of evidence obtained from the accused under compulsion but not the means by which that evidence was initially obtained. They also distinguished the Funke v. France judgment (25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A), pointing out that Mr Funke was subjected to a continuing sanction as long as he refused to provide the requested information. The John Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment (8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I no. 1) was also distinguished, the Government emphasising that Mr Murray\u2019s case related to the subsequent drawing of negative inferences from that applicant\u2019s silence during questioning whereas proceedings had never been taken against the present applicant. The Government considered the Serves v. France case (judgment of 20 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, no. 53) to be similar to the present case but, nevertheless, also distinguishable in that Mr Serves\u2019 objection was premature because he refused to take the oath as a witness rather than being compelled to respond to questions.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n35. The applicant, citing the above-cited John Murray, Funke, Serves and Saunders\u2019 judgments, argued that Article 6 applied to his complaints because, once he was arrested and questioned, he was \u201ccharged\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that term in Article 6. Moreover, and while he was not complaining about the procedural fairness of the proceedings by which he was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment, his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention were violated by his being obliged to spend time in prison for maintaining his defence rights once he had been so \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6. If he was excluded from relying on the relevant Article 6 rights because he had not been \u201ccharged\u201d under Irish law or because he was not subsequently proceeded against on those \u201ccharges\u201d, the relevant guarantees of Article 6 would be rendered ineffective.\n36. As to the Government\u2019s suggestion that any statements made by the applicant pursuant to the section 52 requests would not have been later admissible in evidence against him, the applicant argued that the judicial statements that existed prior to the National Irish Bank Ltd case indicated that such statements would be admissible. He referred, in particular, to the above-cited Court of Criminal Appeal case of McGowan as one of the most authoritative statements on the point when, in July 1996, he was arrested and questioned. He further referred to the comments of the Supreme Court in the above-cited Heaney and McGuinness case on the McGowan case (also cited above). The applicant also pointed to the sixth edition (1991) of the Garda Siochana Handbook which accepted that such statements were admissible in evidence against their authors.\nIn addition, it was standard practice that police notes of interviews of persons detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act were tendered in evidence when such persons were charged and tried, which notes routinely included responses to section 52 requests for information. Indeed, he noted that during his many interviews with the police, the numerous section 52 requests were intermingled with \u2018normal\u2019 questioning so that it was impossible to know where the section 52 questioning began and ended.\nHowever, the applicant accepted that the National Irish Bank Ltd case ruled out the use of section 52 statements in the future unless they were shown to be voluntary. However, that case did allow the admission of evidence obtained as a result or in consequence of section 52 statements obtained.\n37. The applicant further considered that the Government had overstated the threat to national security at the time of his arrest. He underlined the fact that the section 35 proclamation had been in force since 1972 and, accordingly, had become a quasi-permanent part of Irish law. Nevertheless, there had been a steady decline in the pattern and level of violence since the early 1990s and he cited, inter alia, statistics taken from a report of Ireland under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1992-6).\nHe further pointed out that there was no provision for regular independent reviews of the necessity for the continuance of the section 35 proclamation and that no such review had ever been carried out. The recently established review body to which the Government referred was the first ever independent review of the Offences Against the State Acts but the Government had given no indication as to when it would complete its work.\n38. Finally, and although no violation was found in the Serves case, the applicant considered that there had been a violation in his case: questions were put to him whereas the Court found that Mr Serves\u2019 refusal to take the oath, before he had been questioned, was premature; the applicant was arrested for questioning by the police about his involvement in suspected offences; and he was imprisoned, as opposed to fined, for failing to answer questions. As to the Government\u2019s submission that the above-cited John Murray case implied that the right to silence could be restricted in response to national security threats, the applicant argued that inferences could be drawn in that case \u201cin situations which clearly called for an explanation\u201d from the individual in question: there were no circumstances which called for explanation in his case. In fact, the Court stated in the John Murray case that it was incompatible with Article 6 to base a conviction solely or mainly on an accused\u2019s silence whereas that was precisely what happened to him.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention\n39. The Government argued that Article 6 could not apply to the applicant\u2019s complaints because he had not been charged when the section 52 requests were put to him, because no proceedings issued against him on charges of membership of the IRA and because he had a fair hearing on the charge under section 52 of the 1939 Act. The applicant considered that he had been \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of that term in Article 6 of the Convention and that he was entitled to rely on Article 6 \u00a7 1 because he was convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for having defended his defence rights guaranteed by Article 6.\n40. The Court recalls its established case-law to the effect that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6.\nTheir rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right in question is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (the above-cited Saunders judgment, \u00a7 68).\nThe right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned, however, with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent. The Court would note, in this context, that the present case does not concern a request, through the use of compulsory powers, of material which had an existence independent of the will of the applicants such as, documents or blood samples (also the above-cited Saunders judgment, \u00a7 69).\n41. The Court observes that the applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention about having been punished through the application of section 52 of the 1939 Act, for having invoked his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent during police questioning in the course of a serious criminal investigation. It recalls that the autonomous meaning of the expression \u201ccharge\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention means that a person can be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d for the purposes of that Article when that individual\u2019s situation has been \u201csubstantially affected\u201d (the above-cited Serves judgment, \u00a7 42).\n42. While the present applicant had not been formally charged under domestic law on 19-21 October 1996 when the requests under section 52 of the 1939 Act were made, the Court considers that he was, at that point, \u201csubstantially affected\u201d in the above sense, and therefore \u201ccharged\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1, with membership of the IRA contrary to the 1939 Act and with some involvement in the attack in Adare on 7 June 1996.\nThe Government themselves pointed out that the arrest of the applicant took place in the context of police enquiries consequent on the serious attack in Adare which had been established as having been carried out by the IRA. The applicant was expressly arrested and detained under Section 30 of the 1939 Act on suspicion of being a member of the IRA. Having been questioned by the police for 24 hours, it was considered necessary to extend his detention for a further 24 hours during which he was further questioned. Numerous questions were put to him about the Adare incident, the investigation of which had led to the arrest and questioning of most of his family and to his brother being formally charged with offences arising out of that incident. The section 52 requests related to his movements immediately before, during and after the time of the attack in Adare. Many other questions related to his alleged membership of the IRA.\n43. However, it is true that, while the applicant may have been so \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 when the section 52 requests were put to him, no criminal proceedings as regards those charges were pursued against him (\u201csubstantive proceedings\u201d). It is also true that, in general, an individual in that position could not claim to have been a victim of a violation of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention.\n44. Nevertheless, the Court notes that this latter principle has been refined in certain circumstances.\nArticle 6 \u00a7 2 has already been applied, and violations of that provision found, in the Minelli and Sekanina cases (Minelli v. Switzerland judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 62, and Sekanina v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 Series A no. 266-A), even though the relevant national courts concerned had, in the former case, closed the proceedings because the limitation period had expired and had, in the latter case, acquitted the applicant. The Court has also found Article 6 \u00a7 2 to be applicable in respect of the public comments of police officers suggestive of an accused\u2019s guilt of charges even though the proceedings on those charges were subsequently discontinued (Allenet de Ribemont v. France judgment of 10 February 1995, Series A no. 308, \u00a7\u00a7 32-37). Moreover, while Mr Funke was convicted for not supplying information to the customs\u2019 authorities, the criminal proceedings initially considered by those authorities as regards his financial dealings with other countries were never actually initiated against him (see the above-cited Funke judgment).\n45. In the above-cited Allenet de Ribemont case, the Court explained this refinement, pointing out that the Convention, including Article 6 \u00a7 2, must be interpreted in such a way as to guarantee rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory (\u00a7 35 of that judgment). Applying this approach to the present case, the Court notes that, if the applicant is unable to invoke Article 6, the lack of substantive proceedings against him would exclude any consideration under Article 6 of his complaint that he had been, nevertheless, already punished during earlier the criminal investigation for having defended what he considered to be his rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.\n46. In such circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant can invoke Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 in respect of his conviction and imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act.\n##### 2. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention\n47. The Court accepts that the right to silence and not to incriminate oneself guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 are not absolute rights (the above-cited John Murray judgment, \u00a7 47).\n48. However, it is also recalled that Mr Funke\u2019s criminal conviction for refusing to provide information requested by customs\u2019 authorities was considered to amount to a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In that case, the Court noted that the customs\u2019 authorities had secured Mr Funke\u2019s conviction in order to obtain certain documents which they believed existed, although they were not certain of the fact. Being unable or unwilling to procure them by some other means, the Court found that the customs\u2019 authorities attempted to compel Mr Funke himself to provide the evidence of offences he had allegedly committed. The special features of customs law were found insufficient by the Court to justify such an infringement of the right of anyone charged with a criminal offence, within the autonomous meaning of that expression in Article 6, to remain silent and not to contribute to incriminating himself (the above-cited Funke judgment, \u00a7 44).\nIn the John Murray judgment, the Court described the Funke case, pointing out that the \u201cdegree of compulsion\u201d which had been applied through the initiation of criminal proceedings against Mr Funke was found to have been incompatible with Article 6 because \u201cin effect, it destroyed the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination\u201d (the above-cited John Murray judgment, \u00a7 49)\n49. The Government distinguished the Funke case from the present application on the basis of the sanctions imposed. The Court does not find this argument persuasive. The nature of the sanction inflicted on Mr Funke (accumulating fines) may have been different from that imposed in the present case (a single prison sentence). However, both cases concerned the threat and imposition of a criminal sanction because the applicants failed to supply information to authorities investigating the suspected commission of criminal offences by them.\n50. However, the Government pointed out that section 52 of the 1939 Act should be considered against the background of the numerous protections available to persons in the applicant\u2019s position.\n51. The Court notes that the High Court in the above-cited Heaney and McGuinness case (see paragraph 27 above) considered that such protections minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act. Important as they are, the Court is, however, of the view that such protections could only be relevant to the present complaints if they could effectively and sufficiently reduce the degree of compulsion imposed by section 52 of the 1939 Act to the extent that the essence of the rights at issue would not be impaired by that domestic provision. However, it is considered that the protections referred to by the Government could not have had this effect. The application of section 52 of the 1939 Act in an entirely lawful manner and in circumstances which conformed with all of the safeguards referred to above, could not alter the choice presented by section 52 of the 1939 Act: either the information requested was provided by the applicant or he faced potentially six months\u2019 imprisonment.\n52. The Government also maintained that section 52 of the 1939 Act was a reasonable measure given that a statement made pursuant to that section was not later admissible in evidence against its author and because any evidence obtained as a result of such a statement could only be admitted if the trial judge considered it fair and equitable to do so.\nThe applicants essentially considered that the judicial statements made prior to the above-cited National Irish Bank Ltd judgment of January 1999 indicated that such section 52 statements could be later admitted in evidence against their author. While the latter case may have clarified this question, it did not do so until January 1999 and, in any event, that case also indicated that evidence obtained as a result or consequence of section 52 statements could be introduced in evidence against the authors of those statements. Moreover, the applicant pointed to the conflicting cautions given to him many times during his numerous interviews on 19-21 July 1996.\n53. The Court considers that the legal position as regards the admission into evidence of section 52 statements was particularly uncertain in July 1996 when the applicant was questioned. It notes that the text of section 52 of the 1939 Act is silent on this point. It observes that the Government did not refer to any domestic case-law prior to July 1996 which would have authoritatively excluded the later admission into evidence against the applicant of any statements made by him pursuant to those requests. Nor did the Government exclude the possibility that, prior to July 1996, statements made pursuant to section 52 had, in fact, been admitted in evidence against accused persons. The Government\u2019s position was rather that, in any event, the situation had been clarified for the future by the January 1999 judgment in the National Irish Bank Ltd case. This uncertainty about the domestic legal position in July 1996 is underlined by the comments of the Supreme Court in the Heaney and McGuinness case on the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in the earlier McGowan case, the Supreme Court delivering its judgment in the Heaney and McGuinness case only days after the present applicant was released from custody in July 1996 (see paragraphs 25-27 above).\nIn any event, the applicant was provided with conflicting information in this respect by the questioning police officers on numerous occasions on 19-21 October 1996. At the beginning of each interview, the applicant was informed that he had the right to remain silent. Nevertheless, when the section 52 requests were then made during those interviews, he was effectively informed that, if he did not account for his movements at particular times, he risked six months\u2019 imprisonment. The only reference during those interviews to the possible use of statements made by the applicant in any later proceedings was to inform him that anything he did say would be written down and might be used against him. The fact that the applicant was also informed only on certain occasions that the earlier caution ceased to apply once a section 52 request had been made, could not have clarified matters. Moreover, the Court observes, from the police notes of the interviews, that it would have been difficult to discern during those interviews to which questions precisely the section 52 requests related.\n54. The presence of the applicant\u2019s solicitor could not, in such circumstances, have sufficiently remedied the situation. Apart from the fact that that solicitor did not attend the applicant\u2019s interviews with the police, the position remained that the applicant had to choose between, on the one hand, remaining silent, a criminal conviction and potentially a six-month prison sentence and, on the other, forfeiting his right to remain silent and providing information to police officers investigating serious offences at a time when the applicant was considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d with those offences and when it was unclear whether, in domestic law, any section 52 statements made by him would have been later admissible or not in evidence against him.\n55. Given this uncertainty, the position in July 1996 as regards the later admission into evidence of section 52 statements could not have, in the Court\u2019s view, contributed to restoring the essence of the present applicant\u2019s rights to silence and against self-incrimination guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.\nThe Court is not, therefore, called upon in the present case to consider the impact on the rights to silence or against self-incrimination of the direct or indirect use made in later proceedings against an accused of statements made pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act.\n56. Accordingly, the Court finds that the \u201cdegree of compulsion\u201d, imposed on the applicant by the application of section 52 of the 1939 Act with a view to compelling him to provide information relating to charges against him under that Act, in effect, destroyed the very essence of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to remain silent.\n57. The Government contended that section 52 of the 1939 Act is, nevertheless, a proportionate response to the subsisting terrorist and security threat given the need to ensure the proper administration of justice and the maintenance of public order and peace.\n58. The Court has taken judicial notice of the security and public order concerns detailed by the Government.\nHowever, it recalls that in the Saunders case (at \u00a7 74) the Court found that the argument of the United Kingdom Government that the complexity of corporate fraud and the vital public interest in the investigation of such fraud and the punishment of those responsible could not justify such a marked departure in that case from one of the basic principles of a fair procedure. It considered that the general requirements of fairness contained in Article 6, including the right not to incriminate oneself, \u201capply to criminal proceedings in respect of all types of criminal offences without distinction from the most simple to the most complex\u201d. It concluded that the public interest could not be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings.\nMoreover, the Court also recalls that the Brogan case (Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B) concerned the arrest and detention, by virtue of powers granted under special legislation, of persons suspected of involvement in terrorism in Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom Government had relied on the special security context of Northern Ireland to justify the length of the impugned detention periods under Article 5 \u00a7 3. The Court found that even the shortest periods of detention at issue in that case would have entailed consequences impairing the very essence of the relevant right protected by Article 5 \u00a7 3. It concluded that the fact that the arrest and detention of the applicants were inspired by the legitimate aim of protecting the community as a whole from terrorism was not, on its own, sufficient to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n59. The Court, accordingly, finds that the security and public order concerns of the Government cannot justify a provision which extinguishes the very essence of the applicant\u2019s rights to silence and against self incrimination guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n60. It concludes therefore that there has been a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to silence and of his privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nMoreover, given the close link, in this context, between those rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 and the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 40 above), the Court also concludes that there has been a violation of the latter provision.\niI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n61. The applicant also complained that section 52 of the 1939 Act constituted a violation of the rights guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, which Article, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, ... for the protection of the ... rights of others...\u201d\n62. The Government submitted that any interference with the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 10 was in accordance with the law and proportionate to legitimate aims pursued, given the margin of appreciation afforded to the State in such cases. They repeated their submissions under Article 6 about the threat to national security, pointed out that the operation of section 52 was strictly limited and recalled that the arrest of the applicant took place in the context of police enquiries into an atrocity by subversives.\nThe applicant referred to the correlative right not to speak or to furnish information guaranteed by Article 10. He relied on the K. v. Austria case (judgment of 2 June 1993, Series A no. 255-B, application no. 16007/90 Commission Report of 13 October 1992), noting that the Commission held that the prosecution and conviction of that applicant constituted a violation of the right not to impart information guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. Referring to his submissions made under Article 6, he maintained that his conviction and sentencing under section 52 of the 1939 Act constituted a disproportionate interference with his rights under Article 10 of the Convention.\n63. The Court considers that the essential issue raised by the applicant was the compulsion imposed by section 52 of the 1939 Act to respond to the questions of police officers investigating the commission of serious criminal offences, a matter considered above by the Court under Article 6 of the Convention. It does not consider therefore that the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 10 of the Convention give rise to any separate issue.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n64. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n65. The applicant did not claim that he had suffered any pecuniary damage. In so far as the submission that his criminal conviction would create difficulties in seeking work and a visa to the United States could be considered in this context, the Court notes that he has not produced any evidence whatsoever of any applications for or refusals of work or of such a visa.\n66. The applicant claimed compensation, however, for non-pecuniary loss. He pointed out that, as a direct result of section 52 of the 1939 Act, he was convicted of a criminal offence and served a substantial term of imprisonment (from 20 January to 4 June 998).\nHe therefore claimed IR\u00a350,000 (Irish pounds) for all the trauma and distress of his trial, conviction and imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act. He pointed out that his imprisonment cut him off from his family and friends and denied him access to his normal social and recreational activities. He further claimed an unspecified sum for the damage to his reputation as a result of his trial and conviction, particularly felt by the applicant in the Limerick area where his arrest, detention, questioning, trial and conviction took place.\n67. The Government accepted that, in the event of the Court finding a violation, it was reasonable to assume that the applicant suffered some distress and discomfort as a result of his imprisonment. However, the Government requested the Court to take into account the fact that the section 52 requests were put to the applicant in the context of a police investigation into the attack in Adare where one police officer had been shot dead and another seriously wounded. They also considered relevant that the applicant did not substantiate his pecuniary damages claims. They suggested a lesser sum as the Court considered equitable.\nThe Government also maintained that the applicant had not suffered any damage to his reputation as a result of his conviction: they recalled that many other members of the applicant\u2019s family were also arrested and questioned in relation to the Adare incident and pointed out that the applicant had adduced no evidence to show how, because of his conviction, he was held in less public esteem in the circles in which he moved. Alternatively, should the Court take the view that the applicant nevertheless suffered some loss of reputation, the finding of a violation, or any award made under the heading of personal trauma and distress, would suffice.\n68. The Court observes that, as a direct consequence of the violation found in this case, the applicant was convicted of a criminal offence and spent from 20 January to 4 June 1998 in prison. It notes that the applicant has not attempted in any way to detail or substantiate the alleged impairment of reputation to which he referred, although it accepts that, as a result of his criminal conviction and imprisonment, the applicant experienced certain inconvenience, anxiety and distress.\nThe Court concludes that the applicant suffered non-pecuniary damage for which a finding of a violation does not afford just satisfaction. Making its assessment on a equitable basis, it awards the applicant IR\u00a34,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n69. The applicant claimed IR\u00a3605 (inclusive of value-added tax - \u201cVAT\u201d) for the costs of the domestic proceedings. As to the Convention proceedings, he claimed IR\u00a339.20 for obtaining domestic court documents, IR\u00a32000 in respect of counsel\u2019s fees (it not being specified whether this was exclusive or inclusive of VAT and no voucher being submitted), IR\u00a38394.38 as regards solicitors\u2019 fees (inclusive of VAT) together with IR\u00a3302.50 (inclusive of VAT) in respect of outlay. The applicant expressly claimed a total amount of IR\u00a311,813.58. The Government accepted that, subject to certain items in the applicant\u2019s bill of costs being properly vouched (including counsel\u2019s fees), those fees were reasonable. However, they pointed out that the total of the separate figures claimed was IR\u00a311,341.08 and not IR\u00a311,813.08 as claimed by the applicant.\n70. The Court recalls that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, 25.3.99, \u00a7 79).\nAs to the voucher for counsel\u2019s fees to which the Government refer, the Court considers the work completed by counsel for the Convention proceedings to be evident from the detailed bill of costs submitted by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and it notes that the Government did not, in principle, contest the amount claimed in respect of counsel. However, given the failure to indicate whether that amount was inclusive of VAT or not and the absence of the relevant voucher, the Court awards the applicant the amount claimed in this respect, IR\u00a32000, but as a figure inclusive of VAT. The discrepancy, highlighted by the Government, between the individual and total figures claimed has also been noted by the Court.\n71. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court awards to the applicant the separate amounts claimed, with counsel\u2019s fee being awarded at IR\u00a32000 inclusive of VAT. The applicant\u2019s award, in respect of his domestic and Strasbourg legal costs and expenses, amounts therefore to IR\u00a311,341.08 (which figure is inclusive of any VAT that may be chargeable) less the amount of legal aid paid by this Court to the applicants in the sum of 5000 FRF.\n#### C. Default interest\n72. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in Ireland at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention;\n##### 2. Holds that no separate issue arises under Article 10 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention:\n(i) IR\u00a34,000 (four thousand Irish pounds) to the applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) a total of IR\u00a311,341.08 (eleven thousand three hundred and forty-one Irish pounds and eight pence) to the applicant for the costs and expenses of the domestic and Strasbourg proceedings (inclusive of any value-added tax that may be chargeable) less 5,000FRF (five thousand French francs) paid by this Court in legal aid;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 21 December 2000, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nVincent Berger Georg Ress\nRegistrar President", "001-147679": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DAVID THOMAS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n35. The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, 18 September 2012.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained of a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because of an alleged failure of the authorities to put in place the necessary resources to enable him to demonstrate to the Parole Board that his risk had reduced and a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on the ground that his Parole Board review in 2011 was, in these circumstances, a meaningless exercise. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 read as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court ....\n...\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n37. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint essentially concerns adequate access to courses and that it is appropriate to examine it from the angle of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention only (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above).\n38. The Government contested the argument that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in the case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n39. The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies since he had not commenced judicial review proceedings alleging a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In the alternative, they invited the Court to declare the applicant\u2019s complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. Citing Hall v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24712/12, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2013, they argued that the applicant had been given access to numerous courses and assessments both pre- and post-tariff and that his post-tariff detention could therefore not be considered \u201carbitrary\u201d.\n40. The applicant maintained that he had satisfied Article 35 \u00a7 1, since any judicial review claim would have failed on account of the House of Lords\u2019 refusal to find a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in James, Wells and Lee. He also refuted the suggestion that his case was similar to the Hall case, emphasising that he had been given no access whatsoever to courses between September 2010 and May 2012.\n41. The Court is satisfied that at the point at which the applicant lodged his application, the possibility of judicial review proceedings offered no prospect of success as regards systemic delay in access to rehabilitative courses (see Black v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 23543/11, \u00a7 52, 1 July 2014). The Government\u2019s objection is accordingly dismissed.\n42. The Court further considers that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention and is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n43. The applicant relied on this Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee, cited above. He considered it clear from the decision of the Parole Board in August 2011 that the only way that he could address his risk was by completing the SOTP (see paragraph 23 above). He argued that it was not proportionate that he had waited two and a half years for a course which took only six months to complete. He was of the view that had appropriate resources been in place, his assessment for the course would have been completed in two months.\n44. The applicant further emphasised that his tariff period was only one year and nineteen days, and he had not been convicted of a sexual offence. The need to complete the SOTP was solely to address potential future risk.\n45. The Government argued that the Court should not apply James, Wells and Lee in the present case since, in their submission, the case had been wrongly decided.\n46. In the alternative, they contended that even if the principles in James, Wells and Lee were applied here, there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in this case. They emphasised that prior to tariff expiry, there had been no reason to believe that there was any risk of sexual offending. Once this had been revealed by the applicant in September 2010, he had been swiftly reassessed. By January 2011, discussions had taken place between the prison staff and the psychology department regarding the applicant\u2019s treatment needs and by June 2011 he had been informed of his referral for TNA and RM2000 assessments. The assessments had been concluded and the applicant provided with copies of the reports by December 2011. The applicant had clearly been progressed through the prison system and kept informed of developments. There had been no two and a half year delay, as alleged by the applicant. Nineteen months had elapsed between the applicant\u2019s first admission that his offending had a sexual element and his commencement of the SOTP. During this time, steps were being taken by prison staff to address the applicant\u2019s needs. At no time did his post-tariff detention become arbitrary.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n47. The Court sees no reason not to apply the principles set out in James, Wells and Lee, cited above, to the facts of the present case.\n48. In James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7 209, the Court explained that in cases concerning indeterminate sentences of imprisonment for the protection of the public, a real opportunity for rehabilitation was a necessary element of any part of the detention which was to be justified solely by reference to public protection. This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses aimed at helping prisoners to address their offending behaviour and the risks they posed. While Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not impose any absolute requirement for prisoners to have immediate access to all courses they might require, any restrictions or delays encountered as a result of resource considerations had to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that whether a particular course was made available to a particular prisoner depended entirely on the actions of the authorities (see \u00a7 218 of the judgment).\n49. In examining whether an applicant\u2019s detention post-tariff has been unjustified for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention the Court \u201cmust have regard to the detention as a whole\u201d (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7 201). Thus, where, as in the present case, the applicant claims that delay in his access to prison courses constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a), the applicant\u2019s general progression through the prison system must be assessed in light of the particular circumstances of the case (see Hall, cited above, \u00a7 32; and Black, cited above, \u00a7 54).\n50. It is clear from the papers before the Court that the applicant\u2019s progress through the prison system began at an early stage. Prior to the expiry of his short tariff in late January 2009, the CALM programme was identified as an appropriate course on the basis of the information available and a prison transfer took place in order to enable the course to be undertaken (see paragraphs 7-9 above). The applicant commenced the course less than two months after his tariff had expired and completed it in May 2009 (see paragraph 10 above). He also completed an Alcohol Awareness course as well as a course in assertiveness and decision-making (see paragraph 11 above). He was therefore in a position at his review in February 2010 to present the Parole Board with evidence of his risk reduction work. The Parole Board concluded, as it was entitled to do, that further risk reduction work was required (see paragraph 12 above). The Secretary of State confirmed in June 2010 that she agreed with this conclusion (see paragraph 13 above). The applicant does not complain about inadequate access to courses during this period of his detention.\n51. In the context of a September 2010 sentence plan review aimed at identifying further work required, the applicant disclosed for the first time that his offending had a sexual element. The potential need for him to participate in a course aimed at addressing sexual offending risk, namely the SOTP, was swiftly identified. Having regard to the new disclosure, further risk assessment was deemed necessary (see paragraph 14 above). The applicant does not dispute that his disclosure had implications on the nature and extent of the risk posed by him that required further investigation.\n52. The crux of the applicant\u2019s complaint concerns the time taken for the further assessment. The Court notes that three months after his disclosure, in December 2010, he was transferred to another prison establishment for assessment (see paragraph 16 above). The following month, discussions took place between the applicant\u2019s offender supervisor and the psychology department to identify the nature of assessment required (see paragraph 18 above). Less than three months later an initial SOTP assessment was completed (see paragraph 20 above). Immediate clinical guidance was sought by the psychologist in the case and the outcome was that further assessments were sought to evaluate the level of dynamic risk that the applicant posed (see paragraph 21 above). The applicant was informed of his referral for further assessment and given a timetable for progression of his case (see paragraph 22 above). The TNA was completed by August 2011 and a further prison transfer subsequently took place (see paragraph 24 and 27 above). TNA and Treatment Pathway reports, which concluded that the applicant was suitable for the SOTP, were completed in November 2011 and disclosed to him in December (see paragraph 29 above). The applicant commenced the SOTP some five months later, in May 2012 and a SARN report was produced within five months of completion of the course (see paragraphs 31 and 33 above).\n53. In the meantime, a Parole Board review took place. The Panel noted that assessments which were underway in light of the disclosure which had taken place since its last review, and made reference to the need to undertake offending work identified in the forthcoming assessments (see paragraph 23 above). There was no criticism of any perceived delay on the part of the authorities as regards these assessments or the availability of appropriate courses.\n54. In the present case, it can be seen that unlike in the case of James, Wells and Lee, prompt steps were taken to begin the applicant\u2019s progression through the prison system. It is true that the applicant did not commence the SOTP until some twenty months after he had disclosed that his offending had a sexual element. However, the evidence demonstrates that throughout this period his case was under active examination by the relevant professionals and relevant assessments were being identified and carried out. In this respect it is clear that the applicant\u2019s representatives were mistaken in expressing the view in December 2011 that no progress had been made since April (see paragraph 30 above). Finally, once it was established in late November 2011 that the applicant was suitable for participation in the SOTP, it was not unreasonable that he had to wait until May 2012 to commence the course having regard both to resource considerations and to the progress that he had already made. A prompt modification was made to the applicant\u2019s parole timetable presumably to enable completion of the course and preparation of post-course assessments in time to be taken into account at his next review (see paragraph 32 above).\n55. In these circumstances the Court is satisfied that a real opportunity for rehabilitation was provided to the applicant and that there was no unreasonable delay in providing him access to assessments and courses. There has accordingly been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 4 November 2014, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Ineta Ziemele\nRegistrar President", "001-76303": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SAADI v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201cpending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter\u201d (Schedule 2, paragraph 16). Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention. It is a form of licensed consent to enter the United Kingdom which may be subjected to conditions, including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person\u2019s residence, employment or occupation (Schedule 2, paragraph 21).\n18. In general (that is, in cases other than those involving Oakington), the SSHD\u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding.\n19. On 16 March 2000 Barbara Roche MP, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new Oakington Reception Centre. Oakington asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018quickly\u2019, including those which may be certified as being \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019. To assist immigration officers, lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at Oakington could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with. It was said that Oakington would strengthen the ability of the Home Office to deal quickly with asylum applications.\n20. Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for Oakington detention. Cases in which detention at Oakington would not be suitable included the following:\n- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors;\n- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers;\n- cases in which there was a dispute as to age;\n- disabled applicants;\n- persons with special medical needs;\n- cases involving disputes as to nationality; and\n- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative.\n21. In addition, all persons believed to be at risk of absconding (from Oakington) were not deemed suitable for detention at Oakington.\n22. The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, social visits room and a religious observance room. The following description was used in the present case:\n\u201cAll of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant, medical centre, social visits room, religious observance and recreation. The practical operation and facilities at Oakington are, however, very different from other detention centres. In particular, there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security, reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications. The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space. Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although, in the interests of privacy and safety, there are two areas where only females and families may go.\u201d\n23. The \u2018House Rules\u2019 for Oakington require, inter alia, that detainees must vacate or return to their room when required; that mail may be required to be opened in front of officers; that detainees must eat at set times and that visits can only be received at particular times. Further, detainees must carry identification at all times (to be shown to officers on request); must obey all staff and attend roll-calls. Male detainees are accommodated separately from their spouses and children and cannot stay with them overnight.\nTHE LAW\n### I . ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant contended that his detention at the Oakington Reception Centre from 2 to 9 January 2001 was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. That provision reads, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government accepted that the applicant\u2019s stay at Oakington constituted a \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d for the purposes of Article 5. They considered, however, that the wording of the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) \u2013 detention \u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d - described the factual state of affairs where a person was seeking to effect an entry but had no authorisation, that being a matter under consideration by the State of entry, and that it did not require the additional feature of an attempted evasion of immigration control. If it were otherwise \u2013 that is, if a person who applied for asylum could not be detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because he was seeking to effect an authorised, rather than an unauthorised entry \u2013 States would be required to authorise entry to all who seek it. It would not even be possible to detain for short periods to make arrangements and verify identity.\n26. The Government also contested the applicant\u2019s thesis that asylum seekers may only be detained where detention is \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to prevent the person absconding or otherwise misbehaving. They noted that Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) contains such a provision, but Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not, and underlined that in the context of detention with a view to deportation, the Court confirmed such an interpretation in Chahal (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 112). The Government considered that the conclusion in Chahal, which was confirmed in \u010conka (\u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2002-I), applies equally to detention with a view to preventing unauthorised detention.\n27. Finally, the Government contended that, in any event, the applicant\u2019s detention was not disproportionate in the circumstances: it was only possible to interview large numbers of applicants in a short time-frame if the applicants were available at short or no notice; the use of nationality as a criterion for choosing candidates for Oakington was only one of a number of criteria and was perfectly proper and justified, and the applicant\u2019s contention that the use of detention was influenced by the reaction of local residents and planning committees was not made out, as the domestic courts which considered the point had also found.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant maintained his claim that to detain a person who presented no threat to immigration control simply in order to accelerate a decision concerning their entry did not \u201cprevent\u201d unauthorised entry, and was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f): there was no risk of the applicant absconding, and indeed Oakington was only used to detain those who were not at risk of absconding. Article 5 \u00a71 (f) did not, however, prevent detention, for example, while an assessment was being made of whether an individual presented an unacceptable risk of absconding and thereby effecting an unauthorised entry.\n29. The applicant underlined that the detention in his case was wholly unrelated to whether he was granted entry: he was granted temporary admission both before and after the period of detention in question, and entry at those times was not \u201cunauthorised\u201d. After a person has been assessed not to present a risk of absconding, examination of his claim and immigration control could be carried out without detention.\n30. For the applicant, detention was such a serious measure that it was only justified where other, less severe measures had been considered and found to be insufficient. The applicant cited with approval the first instance judge who said \u201cSurely measures short of detention should be tried first and detention should be regarded as the last resort\u201d.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles of detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f)\n31. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) permits the lawful arrest or detention of a person in two circumstances. The first is arrest or detention to prevent the person effecting an unauthorised entry into the country. The second is the arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\n32. In a number of cases, the Court has had to consider the meaning of the second limb. In the case of Kolompar, it accepted that the applicant\u2019s detention was in principle justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) where an extradition request had been made and the applicant was no longer detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) or (c) (Kolompar v. Belgium, judgment of 24 September 1992, Series A no. 235\u2011C, \u00a7 36). The Court did not consider whether the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary in order to ensure that he could be extradited, or whether a less intrusive measure would have achieved the same aim.\n33. In the above-mentioned case of Chahal, the Court expressly determined (at \u00a7 112) the question whether the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) contained a \u201cnecessity\u201d test:\n\u201c... it is not in dispute that Mr Chahal has been detained with a \u2018view to deportation\u2019 within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (...). Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not demand that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing; in this respect Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).\nIndeed, all that is required under this provision is that \u2018action is being taken with a view to deportation\u2019. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law\u201d\nThe Court then noted (at \u00a7 113) that any such deprivation of liberty was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) only for as long as deportation proceedings were in progress. If the proceedings were not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention would cease to be permissible under the provision. The Court further examined whether the detention was \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) with particular reference to the safeguards provided by the national system (\u00a7 118).\n34. The Court\u2019s approach in Chahal was reiterated in the above-mentioned case of \u010conka (\u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002\u2011I) in which it stated that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) did not require that the detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary (\u00a7 38).\n35. In Amuur the Court explained that although it was possible for the holding of aliens in an international zone to be interpreted as a restriction on liberty rather than a deprivation of liberty, in the circumstances of the case, the applicants were deprived of their liberty, such that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) applied (Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996\u2011III, \u00a7\u00a7 43-49). The Court concluded in the case that the provision had been violated because the domestic legal rules at the relevant time did not sufficiently guarantee the applicants\u2019 right to liberty (\u00a7 54). It was not required to arrive at any detailed conclusions as to the test to be applied to detention contended to fall within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because the case turned on the quality of the domestic rules which were applicable. It did, however, comment generally on the way in which Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) was to be interpreted. In particular, it held at \u00a7 50 that:\n\u201cWhere the \u201clawfulness\u201c of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u2018a procedure prescribed by law\u2019 has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 19-20,\u00a7 42).\nIn laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u2018in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u2019, Article 5 \u00a7 1 primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law. ...\u201d\n36. By contrast, the Court has considered the stringency of the test to be applied in cases under other heads of Article 5 \u00a7 1. In the case of Article 5 \u00a7 1(b), for example, it has underlined the need for a \u201creasonable balance ... between the importance of securing the fulfilment of the obligations in general and the importance of the right to liberty\u201d (Vasileva v. Denmark, no. 52792/99, \u00a7 38, 25 September 2003). In the context of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e), the Court has emphasised that \u201cit does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is executed in conformity with national law but it must also be necessary in the circumstances\u201d (Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000\u2011III). As the Court noted in Chahal (see above), Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) of the Convention provides in terms that detention must be \u201creasonably considered necessary to prevent [a person\u2019s] committing an offence or fleeing after having done so\u201d to be compatible with the provision.\n##### 2. Application of the general principles\n37. The Court notes that the facts in the present case are not in dispute. The applicant was not detained for the first three days of his presence in the United Kingdom, and he was then detained at the Oakington Centre, a centre which was used for those who were not likely to abscond and who could be dealt with by a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure.\n38. The present case therefore turns on whether the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington fell within the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), which permits the lawful detention \u201cof a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country\u201d.\n39. The first question which the Court must address is whether a person who has presented himself to the immigration authorities and has been granted temporary admission to the country can be considered as a person who is seeking to effect an \u201cunauthorised entry\u201d into the country.\n40. The Court does not accept that, as soon as a potential immigrant has surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, he is seeking to effect an \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, with the result that detention cannot be justified under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). In particular, it is a normal part of States\u2019 \u201cundeniable right to control aliens\u2019 entry into and residence in their country\u201d (Amuur v. France, cited above, \u00a7 41) that States are permitted to detain would-be immigrants who have applied for permission to enter, whether by way of asylum or not. Such detention must be compatible with the overall purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness, but it is evident from the tenor of the judgment in Amuur (referred to above) that the detention of potential immigrants is capable of being compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). As to the difference between a short period of detention on arrival in a country in order to assess the risk of absconding (which the applicant accepts is compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f)) and subsequent detention in order to facilitate the processing of cases (which he does not), the Court agrees with the Government that, until a potential immigrant has been granted leave to remain in the country, he has not effected a lawful entry, and detention can reasonably be considered to be aimed at preventing unlawful entry.\n41. The Court therefore considers that, although the applicant had applied for asylum and had been granted temporary admission to the country on 30 December 2000, and had been at large (albeit after being granted only temporary admission and subject to conditions) until 2 January 2001, his detention from that date was nevertheless to prevent his effecting an unlawful entry because, absent formal admission clearance, he had not \u201clawfully\u201d entered the country.\n42. The next question for the Court, which is also the question which taxed the domestic courts, is whether it is permissible for a State to detain a potential asylum seeker or immigrant in circumstances where there is no risk of his absconding or other misconduct. The question is particularly well-defined in the present case as the applicant was held at Oakington, a centre used only for those who did not present a risk of absconding (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) and where the application could be considered quickly (paragraphs 19 and 20 above).\n43. Mr Justice Collins, the first-instance judge in the present case, found that domestic law did not impose a \u201cnecessity\u201d test, with the result that the detention was compatible with the domestic law. In considering Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), however, he did not accept that the applicant needed to be detained because there was no risk that he would abscond or otherwise misbehave. That finding was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which considered that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) required immigration authorities not to prolong unduly the detention of aliens pending consideration of applications for leave to enter, or for deportation, but that it did not apply a necessity test to those procedures. The House of Lords underlined that the aim of detention at Oakington was to speed up immigration procedures by using a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure which could be applied in relatively straightforward cases. It, too, considered that in the absence of any express or implied necessity test in the Convention or the Convention case-law, immigration detention could be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) even though it was not \u201cnecessary\u201d. The House of Lords added, in connection with the question whether detention was a disproportionate response to the reasonable requirements of immigration control, that the need for speedy determination of claims favoured accepting the Oakington procedure as proportionate and reasonable.\n44. Detention of a person is a major interference with personal liberty, and must always be subject to close scrutiny. Where individuals are lawfully at large in a country, the authorities may only detain if \u2013 as the Court expressed the position in Vasileva (referred to above) \u2013 a \u201creasonable balance\u201d is struck between the requirements of society and the individual\u2019s freedom. The position regarding potential immigrants, whether they are applying for asylum or not, is different to the extent that, until their application for immigration clearance and/or asylum has been dealt with, they are not \u201cauthorised\u201d to be on the territory. Subject, as always, to the rule against arbitrariness, the Court accepts that the State has a broader discretion to decide whether to detain potential immigrants than is the case for other interferences with the right to liberty. Accordingly, and this finding does no more than apply to the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) the ruling the Court has already made as regards the second limb of the provision, there is no requirement in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) that the detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing. All that is required is that the detention should be a genuine part of the process to determine whether the individual should be granted immigration clearance and/or asylum, and that it should not otherwise be arbitrary, for example on account of its length.\n45. It is plain that in the present case the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington was a bona fide application of the policy on \u201cfast-track\u201d immigration decisions. As to the question of arbitrariness, the Court notes that the applicant was released once his asylum claim had been refused, leave to enter the United Kingdom had been refused, and he had submitted a notice of appeal. The detention lasted a total of seven days, which the Court finds not to be excessive in the circumstances. The Court is not required to set a maximum period on permitted detention, although it notes that the present form of detention is ordered on administrative authority alone.\n46. The Court considers that other claims of arbitrariness made by the applicant \u2013 for example that the detention was arbitrary precisely because its aim was to decide more speedily, rather than for any reason related to the applicant, or because it involved the use of lists of countries whose nationals could or could not be detained at Oakington \u2013 are in effect re-statements of the claim that there should be a \u201cnecessity\u201d test for such detention. Moreover, domestic law provided a system of safeguards which enabled the applicant to challenge the lawfulness of his detention, as is shown by the domestic decisions in the present case.\n47. It follows that the applicant\u2019s detention from 2 to 9 January 2001 was not incompatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. There has therefore been no violation of that provision.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n48. The applicant contended the first reasons he was given for his detention were given, orally and to his representative, some 76 hours after his arrest and detention, in contravention of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cEveryone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n49. The Government pointed to the general statements of intent as to Oakington. They accepted that the forms in use at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention were deficient, but contended that the reasons given orally to the applicant\u2019s on-site representative (who knew the general reasons) on 5 January 2001 were sufficient to enable the applicant to challenge the lawfulness of his detention under Article 5 \u00a7 4 if he wished.\n##### 2. The applicant\n50. The applicant underlined that unsolicited reasons were not given at any stage, and that solicited reasons were given orally in the afternoon of 5 January 2001, some 76 hours after the arrest and detention. He contended that mere reference to policy announcements cannot displace the requirement to provide sufficiently prompt, adequate reasons to the applicant in relation to his detention.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n51. Article 5 \u00a7 2 contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5: by virtue of paragraph 2 any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees \ufb01t, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 4. Whilst this information must be conveyed \u2018promptly\u2019, it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see Bordovskiy v. Russia, no. 49491/99, \u00a7\u00a7 55, 56, 8 February 2005; Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, \u00a7 40). When a person is arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, Article 5 \u00a7 2 neither requires that the necessary information be given in a particular form, nor that it consists of a complete list of the charges held against the arrested person (see X v. Germany, no. 8098/77, Commission decision of 13 December 1978, DR 16, p. 111). When a person is arrested with a view to extradition, the information given may be even less complete (see K. v. Belgium, no. 10819/84, Commission decision of 5 July 1984, DR 38, p. 230).\n52. As to the question of whether information has been given \u201cpromptly\u201d, the Court recalls that in the above-mentioned case of \u010conka, the Court found no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 2 where the applicant was given broad reasons for his detention when he was detained, and written reasons were supplied two days later. In Fox, Campbell and Hartley, which concerned detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) of the Convention, the applicants were given reasons for their arrest within a maximum of seven hours after arrest, which the Court accepted as \u201cprompt\u201d (referred to above, \u00a7 42). A violation was found where applicants who had been detained pending extradition were not given any information for the first four days\u2019 detention (Shamayev and Others v. Georgia and Russia, no. 36378/02, \u00a7 416, ECHR 2005\u2011...).\n53. The Court first notes, in reply to the Government\u2019s reference to the general statements of intent about Oakington, that it is plain from the wording of Article 5 \u00a7 2 that the duty on States is to furnish specific information to the individual or his representative. General statements \u2013 parliamentary announcements in the present case \u2013 cannot replace the need for the individual to be informed of the reasons for his arrest or detention.\n54. It became apparent in the course of the domestic proceedings in the present case that if the applicant had been given a form to explain the reasons for his detention, that form would have been inaccurate in that it would not have included the true reason, which was that the immigration officer was satisfied that his case could be decided quickly using the \u201cfast-track procedure\u201d established at Oakington. There has been no suggestion in the proceedings before the Court that the applicant was informed orally on 2 January 2001 of the reason for his detention.\n55. The first time the real reason for the applicant\u2019s detention was given was when his representative was informed by telephone on 5 January 2001 that the applicant was an Iraqi who met the criteria for Oakington. At that time, the applicant had been in detention for some 76 hours. Assuming that the giving of oral reasons to a representative meets the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the Court finds that a delay of 76 hours in providing reasons for detention is not compatible with the requirement of the provision that such reasons should be given \u201cpromptly\u201d.\n56. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION\n57. The applicant contended that the preparation of lists of nationalities in respect of which detention at Oakington would be considered amounted to a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), as the applicant was detained because of his Iraqi nationality.\nThe Court has dealt with the substance of this complaint in its determination of the issues under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention, and holds that it is not necessary to consider it separately under Article 14.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n58. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n59. The applicant claimed EUR 5,000 compensation for non-pecuniary damage in respect of the seven days he spent in detention in Oakington, referring specifically to the distress he felt at the decision to detain him.\n60. The Government noted that the period of detention was relatively short, and considered that if there were a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), the sum of EUR 2,000 represented adequate non-pecuniary compensation. As regards Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the Government considered that a finding of a breach would provide sufficient just satisfaction.\n61. The Court has found a violation only of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, and agrees with the Government that in these circumstances the finding of a breach provides sufficient just satisfaction for the violation established.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n62. The applicant claimed a total of GBP 15,305.56 by way of costs before the Court, including counsel\u2019s fees.\n63. The Government considered that the fees were not necessarily incurred, and suggested that counsel\u2019s fees should be reduced from GBP 11,475 plus VAT to a maximum of GBP 4,000. They contended that, if violations were not found on all the provisions of Article 5 that were found admissible, the amount should be reduced proportionately.\n64. The Court has found a violation of only one provision of the Convention. It is apparent that the major part of the work on the case, before the Court as before the domestic courts, has been that related to the compatibility of the detention with Article 5 \u00a7 1. The Court awards the applicant the sum of EUR 1,500 in respect of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\n#### C. Default interest\n65. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds by four votes to three that there has been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds unanimously that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention;\n3. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to consider Article 14 of the Convention separately;\n##### 4. Holds unanimously\n(a) that finding a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage;\n(b) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) for costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(c) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 11 July 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L. Early Josep Casadevall\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) concurring opinion of Sir Nicolas Bratza;\n(b) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Casadevall, Mr Traja and Mr Sikuta.\n#### J.C.M.\nT.L.E\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE SIR NICOLAS BRATZA\nI am in agreement with the majority of the Chamber on all aspects of the case and only add a few words of my own on the complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because of the importance of the question raised.\nAt the heart of the applicant\u2019s case is the claim that to detain a person who presented no threat to immigration control for the sole purpose of facilitating an early decision concerning his entry into the United Kingdom did not serve \u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country\u201d and was not thus compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). That the applicant himself presented no such threat was, it is argued, amply demonstrated by the facts of the present case: the applicant had not been detained immediately on arrival in the United Kingdom but had been granted temporary admission to the country during which he had fully complied with the reporting requirements and had given no indication of any intention to abscond or otherwise to effect an unauthorised entry into the country. The fact that his detention was not intended to prevent his unauthorised entry was further confirmed by the fact that, once the decision had been taken formally to refuse him leave to enter the United Kingdom, the applicant was immediately released.\nI readily accept that Dr Saadi had no intention to effect an unauthorised entry into the United Kingdom but that, on the contrary, his conduct throughout was consistent only with his intention to effect an authorised lawful entry into the country. However, I consider that to interpret Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) as only permitting detention of a person who is shown to be seeking to effect an unauthorised entry is to place too narrow a construction on the terms of the provision. In this respect, I share the opinion of the House of Lords that, until a State has \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, the entry is unauthorised and the State has in principle power to detain under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) until the application has been considered and authorisation has been granted or refused. While the applicant was granted temporary admission on his arrival in the United Kingdom, this did not, by virtue of section 11 of the 1971 Act, constitute the authorisation of entry into the country.\nAgain, like the House of Lords, I do not consider that on the true construction of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) it is a precondition of the power to detain that detention should be \u201cnecessary\u201d to prevent an unauthorised entry, in the sense that the use of less severe measures would not suffice either to prevent unauthorised entry or to allow a determination to be made as to whether an individual should be granted immigration clearance or asylum. As noted in the judgment, in the case of Chahal, the Court expressly rejected the contention that the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) demanded that the detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to deportation should reasonably be considered necessary to prevent the\napplicant from committing an offence or fleeing and that in this respect Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provided a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c). This interpretation was reaffirmed in the \u010conka case. While it is true that the first limb of the sub-paragraph (\u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d) and the second limb (\u201cagainst whom action is being taken with a view to deportation\u201d) are not framed in identical terms, I can find no valid reason for confining the Court\u2019s reasoning to the second limb of the sub-paragraph or for holding that a different and stricter test should be applied to the first limb.\nAlthough for these reasons I consider that the detention of the applicant fell within the provisions of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), I recognise the concern felt that a person should be deprived of his liberty for reasons essentially of administrative efficiency and the risks of arbitrariness which such detention may entail. As has frequently been emphasised in the Court\u2019s case-law, any deprivation of liberty must be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness. In the context of detention at the Oakington Centre, this requires not only that the detention of an immigrant lasts for no longer than is required to complete the procedures for deciding whether to grant entry but that the period of detention should be short. The detention in the present case lasted for a total of 7 days, which the majority has found not to be excessive. While I can agree that the period of the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington was within the limits of what could be regarded as acceptable, any period of detention significantly in excess of this period would in my view not be compatible with the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f).\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES CASADEVALL, TRAJA AND SIKUTA\n1. In the present judgment, the majority (four judges to three) held, inter alia, that there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. We cannot support that conclusion, for the following reasons:\n2. Under international law, a State has the right, by virtue of its sovereignty, to control the entry and stay of foreigners on its territory. It is, however, equally well established that a State party to the Convention must be deemed to agree to restrict the free exercise of its rights under general international law to the extent and within the limits of the obligations which it has accepted under that Convention.\n3. In the instant case, it was open to the United Kingdom authorities, when the applicant arrived in the United Kingdom, to deprive him of his liberty (that is, to detain him) under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) on the following condition alone: namely, to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country. On the basis of the facts in this case, the purpose of the applicant\u2019s detention was not, however to prevent the applicant\u2019s entry at all. The applicant arrived at London Heathrow Airport on 30 December 2000 and applied for asylum upon his arrival. If the competent authorities had been of the opinion that there existed grounds for detaining him in order to prevent him from effecting an unauthorised entry into the territory, they could have exercised that \u201cright to control entry\u201d at that moment for the purpose set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). However, the immigration authorities, on the contrary, granted him \u201ctemporary admission\u201d and he was permitted to stay at a hotel of his choice inside the country. The grant of temporary admission was subsequently extended twice, on two consecutive days. We therefore strongly believe that the pre-condition for the applicant\u2019s detention, namely that it be for the purpose of preventing him from effecting an unauthorised entry into the country, was not met, for the simple reason that the immigration authorities had already admitted him.\n4. The applicant applied for asylum upon arrival at London Heathrow Airport, at the immigration desk, in line with the national law. He followed all the instructions given to him by the immigration authorities and reported to them on a regular basis. He did not misuse the asylum procedure and did not hide. On the contrary, he co-operated with the immigration officers. He was granted legally recognized admission, regardless of whether it was temporary or not. From the moment of lodging the asylum application, the asylum procedure started. The asylum procedure is legally recognized and prescribed by national law. It is a procedure which can last for anything\nfrom a few days to several years. The possibility of detaining an asylum seeker at any time during the asylum procedure on the ground that it was to \u201cprevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country\u201d would represent great legal uncertainty for the person concerned. States which are parties to international instruments dealing with the legal status of asylum seekers and refugees (e.g. the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, but also instruments in other systems, e.g. the European Union and the Council of Europe) are obliged to grant an asylum seeker admission to the territory (but not a residence permit) until the final decision in the asylum procedure is taken. This also happened in the instant case, where the respondent Government admitted the applicant to the territory. Paradoxically, as indicated in paragraph 45 of the judgment, the applicant was detained for seven days, and was then released from detention after his asylum claim had been refused.\n5. Lastly, we are of the opinion that the arguments mentioned in paragraph 54 of the judgment, which led to a finding of a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (non-communication of reasons for detention), provide support for our argument that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention, because the true reason for detention of the applicant had nothing to do with that provision. The true reason was purely based on administrative or bureaucratic grounds aiming to place the applicant in Oakington detention and to follow the \u201cfast-track procedure\u201d. The majority recognized this explicitly when they affirmed that \u201c...that form would have been inaccurate in that it would not have included the true reason...\u201d, which would have justified such detention.\n6. For those reasons, since the applicant was not, in our view, detained for the purpose of preventing his effecting an entry into the territory, and since his entry cannot be considered as unauthorised, we do not agree with the conclusion that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) has not been violated.", "001-57886": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF WYNNE v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 February and 22 June 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge. Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside (see, in this connection, the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n#### B. Release on licence and revocation of a licence\n13. Under section 61 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State may release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment only if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.\n14. Under section 62 (7) of the 1967 Act, if a person subject to a licence is convicted on indictment of an offence, the trial court may, whether or not it passes any other sentence on him, revoke the licence.\n15. The effect of revocation of a licence, whether by the Secretary of State or by a court, is that the person is liable to be detained in pursuance of his sentence (section 62 (9) of the 1967 Act).\n16. It is the duty of the Parole Board to advise the Secretary of State with respect to, inter alia, the release on licence under section 61, and the recall under section 62, of persons whose cases have been referred to the Board by the Secretary of State (section 59 of the 1967 Act; see also the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 21-22, paras. 57-58).\n#### C. Procedures for review of life sentences\n17. Prior to 1992, in respect of both mandatory and discretionary life sentences, the Secretary of State would receive the views of the judiciary (the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice) on the period deemed necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence (\u201cthe tariff period\u201c) and of the Parole Board on the question of risk. The Secretary of State would decide when, if at all, it was appropriate to release the prisoner on life licence.\nHe accepted the views of the judiciary, in discretionary life sentence cases, as to the length of the tariff period. However, in mandatory life sentence cases he formed his own judgment on that question, taking into account the views of the judiciary (for the distinction between discretionary and mandatory life sentences, see the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n18. Following the judgment of the European Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (loc. cit.) changes to the procedures for the release of discretionary life prisoners were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201c). Parliament decided, however, not to extend these changes to mandatory life sentences. Under section 34 of this Act discretionary life prisoners are now informed by the trial judge, in open court, of the tariff period appropriate for the offence. After the expiry of that period, the prisoner has a right to be released on life licence if and when the Parole Board decides that it is safe to do so. They are entitled to appear before the Board in person, to see all the reports placed before it, and to call witnesses and submit documentary evidence. When the Board decides that a prisoner should be released the Secretary of State is under a duty to do so (section 34 (3) of the 1991 Act).\nSection 34 (7) (a) of the 1991 Act specifically excludes from eligibility for review under the new procedures a discretionary life prisoner who is also serving a mandatory life sentence.\n19. In the debate in the House of Commons on 16 July 1991 concerning this legislation, the Minister of State for the Home Department made the following statement concerning the differences between mandatory and discretionary life sentences:\n\u201cMandatory life sentence cases ... raise quite different issues and the Government do not agree that it is appropriate to extend a similar procedure to these cases. In a discretionary case, the decision on release is based purely on whether the offender continues to be a risk to the public. The presumption is that once the period that is appropriate to punishment has passed, the prisoner should be released if it is safe to do so.\nThe nature of the mandatory sentence is different. The element of risk is not the decisive factor in handing down a life sentence. According to the judicial process, the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the State for the rest of his days. If necessary, he can be detained for life without the necessity for a subsequent judicial intervention.\nThe presumption is, therefore, that the offender should remain in custody until and unless the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner\u2019s release than by his continued detention. In exercising his continued discretion in this respect, the Home Secretary must take account not just of the question of risk, but of how society as a whole would view the prisoner\u2019s release at that juncture. The Home Secretary takes account of the judicial recommendation, but the final decision is his.\u201c\n20. In relation to mandatory life prisoners, the Secretary of State continues to decide the length of the tariff after considering advice from the judiciary and any representations which the prisoner wishes to make. After the expiry of that period, he has power to release the prisoner on life licence if recommended to do so by the Parole Board. The decision on whether to release is for him alone.\n21. On 27 July 1993 the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence, the Secretary of State\n\u201cwill consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice\u201c.\n22. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (the \u201ctariff\u201c) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner\u2019s risk to the public following the expiry of the \u201ctariff\u201c (R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 Weekly Law Reports 135; R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 All England Reports 576; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Cox (judgment of the Divisional Court of 4 September 1992); R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Creamer and Scholey (judgment of the Divisional Court of 21 October 1992)).\n23. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1993] 3 All England Reports 92, the House of Lords observed that, in contrast with the position as regards discretionary life sentences, the theory and the practice in respect of mandatory life sentences were out of tune.\nIn his speech, with which the other Law Lords agreed, Lord Mustill explained that the policy whereby murder was treated as an offence so grave that the proper penal element of the sentence was detention for life was inconsistent with the practice adopted by successive Secretaries of State that a mandatory life sentence included a \u201ctariff\u201c period to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. A mandatory life prisoner knew that once he had served the penal element of his sentence the penal consequences of his crime had been exhausted.\nNevertheless, the Secretary of State was not obliged to adopt the judicial view of the \u201ctariff\u201c period and it was he who was entrusted with the task of deciding on the prisoner\u2019s release. He was entitled to depart from the judge\u2019s advice and to have regard to broader considerations of a public character than those which applied to an ordinary sentencing function. He added (loc. cit., p. 105):\n\u201cThe discretionary and mandatory life sentences, having in the past grown apart, may now be converging. Nevertheless, on the statutory framework, the underlying theory and the current practice there remains a substantial gap between them. It may be - I express no opinion - that the time is approaching when the effect of the two types of life sentence should be further assimilated. But this is a task for Parliament, and I think it quite impossible for the courts to introduce a fundamental change in the relationship between the convicted murderer and the State, through the medium of judicial review.\u201c\nLord Mustill considered that, having regard to the rights which discretionary prisoners had, the Secretary of State was required to comply with the following requirements of procedural fairness when fixing the penal element in a mandatory life sentence: the Secretary of State must inform such a prisoner of the judicial advice on the length of the \u201ctariff\u201c, and give him the opportunity to make written representations on that subject before he decides on the appropriate term of years. If the Secretary of State departs from the judicial advice, he must give reasons for doing so.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n24. The applicant lodged his application (15484/89) on 15 June 1989.\nHe complained under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention that he was unable to have the continued lawfulness of his detention reviewed by a tribunal.\nHe also complained about a number of other matters, including an alleged assault by prison staff in June 1985 and his transfer from hospital to prison subsequent to December 1985. He further claimed that he had been prevented from defending himself and had no domestic remedies available to him in respect of his various complaints. In these connections he relied on Articles 6, 8, 10 and 13 (art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 13) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).\n25. On 15 October 1992 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint admissible in so far as it raised issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\nIn its report of 4 May 1993 drawn up under Article 31 (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) (ten votes to five). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report are reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n26. The applicant alleged a breach of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) which provides:\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201c\n27. The applicant maintained that he was now detained primarily under the authority of the discretionary sentence; that in any event Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) applied in the same manner to mandatory life sentences as it did to discretionary sentences; and, further, that he ought, at least, to be able to have reviewed the lawfulness of his continued detention under the discretionary sentence.\nThe Court has examined each of these claims in turn.\n#### A. The legal basis for the applicant\u2019s detention\n28. The applicant submitted in the first place that it is the discretionary life sentence which has become the real and effective basis for his detention since his conviction in 1982. It was this sentence, imposed on him because of his dangerousness, which was intended by the trial judge to be the primary authority for this detention from then on. While he did not suggest that the mandatory sentence had disappeared, the judicial objective served by both the mandatory and the discretionary sentences had become a preventive one following his second conviction. The revocation of the mandatory life licence was thus, in reality, the logical corollary of the discretionary sentence.\nIn the alternative, he maintained that the judicial finding in 1982 that he was suffering from a long-standing mental disorder broke the chain of causation between the original mandatory life sentence and his subsequent re-detention under that sentence. His legal status was altered to that of someone who was not fully responsible for his actions who needed to be left in preventive detention.\nHe was - he claimed - thus entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined by a court.\n29. For both the Government and the Commission the mandatory life sentence continued to be operative following the revocation of his life licence.\n30. The Court notes that the applicant received a mandatory life sentence in 1964 and was released on life licence in 1980. This, however, was revoked by the trial judge in 1982 following the applicant\u2019s conviction for manslaughter. As a result his detention thereafter was based on both the mandatory sentence, which remained in force, and the new discretionary life sentence (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 15 above). The fact that he committed a further offence in 1981 and was judged to be suffering from a mental disorder at that time in no way affected under English law the continued validity of the original sentence or its reactivation on his recall. It merely provided a supplementary legal basis for his detention.\n#### B. Entitlement to review of the lawfulness of detention under the mandatory life sentence\n31. The applicant further submitted that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) applied to mandatory life sentences in the same way as it applied to discretionary life sentences. He maintained that the distinction made by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom (loc. cit., pp. 27 and 29, paras. 70, 73-74) between these two types of life sentence was no longer valid since it was based on the false assumption that a mandatory sentence had as its object the punishment of a murderer for life. In fact the mandatory sentence had not been interpreted in this way by Parliament, the courts, the Parole Board or by successive Home Secretaries. Indeed recent court decisions have described the mandatory sentence as composed, like the discretionary life sentence, of a period of punishment (the \u201ctariff\u201c) to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence as well as a period of preventive detention, following the expiry of the \u201ctariff\u201c period. Furthermore, the procedures that have developed to review the mandatory sentence have been founded on the understanding that when the requirements of punishment have been satisfied the only justification for continued detention is dangerousness. In particular, there is a presumption that at this point the prisoner will be released unless he is a danger to the public.\nAccordingly, he submitted, it follows from the very nature of the mandatory life sentence that the applicant is entitled to invoke the same protection afforded under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to discretionary life prisoners in the post-tariff stage, namely a review by a court of his continued dangerousness.\n32. The Government, with whom the Commission agreed, contended that a mandatory life sentence was imposed as punishment for the gravity of the offence of murder, as perceived by Parliament. By contrast, a discretionary life sentence was imposed because of the judicial assessment of the offender as mentally unstable or dangerous, conditions which may change over time. They rejected the applicant\u2019s thesis that the mandatory sentence was handed down in part for reasons of security and risk, pointing out that a trial judge was obliged under English law to sentence a murderer to life imprisonment even if he was satisfied that the murderer posed no danger as, for example, in the case of \u201cmercy killing\u201c. Parliament had considered that such a grave crime deserved to be punished by life imprisonment and had removed all discretion as to sentencing from the trial court. The sentencing of a murderer could thus not be characterised as a decision of the court to confine a dangerous offender unless and until he was safe to be released. Moreover, it was a matter for the Secretary of State to decide if and when a murderer should be released on licence having regard to the public interest, in the light of stated criteria which govern the exercise of this discretion (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).\nIn sum, the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) were satisfied by the original trial procedure.\n33. The Court recalls its judgment in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (loc. cit.) where it held that discretionary life prisoners were entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of their continued detention decided by a court at reasonable intervals and to have the lawfulness of any re-detention determined by a court. This view was taken because of the very nature of the discretionary life sentence which, unlike the mandatory sentence, was imposed not because of the inherent gravity of the offence but because of the presence of factors which were susceptible to change with the passage of time, namely mental instability and dangerousness. A clear distinction was drawn between the discretionary life sentence which was considered to have a protective purpose and a mandatory life sentence which was viewed as essentially punitive in nature (ibid., pp. 27 and 29, paras. 70, 73-74).\n34. The applicant is now asking the Court to reconsider its characterisation of the mandatory sentence in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell on the grounds inter alia that recent English judicial pronouncements have tended to assimilate both types of life sentence.\n35. The Court notes judicial comments to the effect that the theory and practice of the mandatory sentence are out of tune and that, for purposes of procedures designed to consider the release of the mandatory prisoner as well as the standards of fairness applicable to such procedures, the mandatory sentence should also be seen as containing both a punitive and a preventive element (see paragraphs 22-23 above).\nHowever, the fact remains that the mandatory sentence belongs to a different category from the discretionary sentence in the sense that it is imposed automatically as the punishment for the offence of murder irrespective of considerations pertaining to the dangerousness of the offender (see paragraph 12 above). That mandatory life prisoners do not actually spend the rest of their lives in prison and that a notional tariff period is also established in such cases - facts of which the Court was fully aware in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 74), - does not alter this essential distinction between the two types of life sentence.\nAs observed by the House of Lords in R. v. Secretary of State, ex parte Doody, while the two types of life sentence may now be converging there remains nonetheless, on the statutory framework, the underlying theory and the current practice, a substantial gap between them (see paragraph 23 above). This is borne out by the very facts inter alia relied on by the applicant to support his case, namely that in mandatory life sentences the release of the prisoner is entirely a matter within the discretion of the Secretary of State who is not bound by the judicial recommendation as to the length of the tariff period and who is free under English law to have regard to other criteria than dangerousness, following the expiry of the \u201ctariff\u201c period, in deciding whether the prisoner should be released (see paragraphs 19, 21 and 23 above). It is further reflected in the decision of Parliament to limit the application of the new procedures in the 1991 Act to discretionary life sentences only, even in cases like the present where the prisoner is serving both a mandatory and a discretionary life sentence (see paragraph 18 above).\n36. Against the above background, the Court sees no cogent reasons to depart from the finding in the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell case that, as regards mandatory life sentences, the guarantee of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) was satisfied by the original trial and appeal proceedings and confers no additional right to challenge the lawfulness of continuing detention or re-detention following revocation of the life licence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cossey v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 184, p. 14, para. 35). Accordingly, in the circumstances of the present case, there are no new issues of lawfulness which entitle the applicant to a review of his continued detention under the original mandatory life sentence.\n#### C. Entitlement to review of the lawfulness of detention under the discretionary life sentence\n37. The applicant has, however, also contended that at the very least Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) confers on him the right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention on the basis of the discretionary life sentence.\n38. The Court does not accept this claim. A review of the lawfulness of the applicant\u2019s detention following his conviction for manslaughter (see paragraph 7 above) would be devoid of purpose since he is also serving a mandatory life sentence for murder at the same time and enjoys no possibility of release until the Secretary of State considers that it is in the public interest to do so (see, mutatis mutandis, the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 31, para. 73, and paragraphs 19, 21 and 23 above).\n#### D. Conclusion\n39. In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nHerbert PETZOLD\nActing Registrar", "001-57867": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF FREDIN v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 1993 and 25 January 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n11. The 1988 Act was introduced as a result of the European Court\u2019s findings in several cases, notably against Sweden, that lack of judicial review of certain administrative decisions infringed Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (see, for instance, the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 29-31, paras. 78-87; the Pudas v. Sweden and the Bod\u00e9n v. Sweden judgments of 27 October 1987, respectively Series A no. 125-A, pp. 13-17, paras. 28-42, and Series A no. 125-B, pp. 39-42, paras. 26-37). It was enacted as a temporary law to remain in force until 1991; its validity was subsequently extended to the end of 1994.\n12. Pursuant to section 1 of this Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or another public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only judicial instance, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-\u00e0-vis a private individual. The kind of administrative decision covered by the Act is further defined in Chapter 8, sections 2 and 3 of the Instrument of Government, to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decisions which fall outside its scope, none of which is relevant in the instant case.\nIn proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, the Supreme Administrative Court examines whether the contested decision \u201cconflicts with any legal rule\u201c (section 1 of the 1988 Act). According to the preparatory work to the Act, as reproduced in Government Bill 1987/88:69 (pp. 23-24), its review of the merits of cases concerns essentially questions of law but may, in so far as is relevant for the application of the law, extend also to factual issues; it must also consider whether there are any procedural errors which may have affected the outcome of the case.\n13. If the Supreme Administrative Court finds that the impugned decision is unlawful, it must quash it and, where necessary, refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority (section 5 of the 1988 Act, as applicable at the relevant time).\n14. The procedure before the Supreme Administrative Court is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act 1971. It is in principle a written procedure, but the Supreme Administrative Court may decide to hold an oral hearing on specific matters if this is likely to assist it in its examination of the case or to expedite the proceedings (section 9).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n15. In his application of 9 April 1991 (no. 18928/91) to the Commission, Mr Fredin alleged that he had been denied a \u201cfair and public hearing\u201c before the Supreme Administrative Court, in breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n16. On 12 October 1992 the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 9 February 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by sixteen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT\n17. At the hearing on 21 September 1993, the Government repeated the invitation made in their letter of 23 August (see paragraph 4 above) and calling upon the Court to rule on whether the facts of the present case disclose a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\n18. Mr Fredin invoked Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\nThis provision is applicable to the proceedings in issue and this has not been disputed before the Court. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s contention that it had been violated, accepted by the Commission, was contested by the Government.\n19. As to the general scope of the right to an oral hearing in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the Government maintained that to regard this right as unconditional might exacerbate what was already a major problem for courts in the Contracting States, namely the excessive length of proceedings. In cases where the issues to be decided were of a purely legal nature, there was no real need for an oral hearing; as has been suggested by the dissenting members of the Commission, legal arguments could often be presented more effectively in writing than orally.\nWith regard to the specific circumstances of the case, the Government stressed that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s role was primarily to review the lawfulness of the decision before it and to determine whether it should be upheld or quashed; it could not substitute its own decision. It had refused the applicant an oral hearing because the majority of the judges sitting on the case had found they did not require a clarification of the facts in order to be able to reach a decision; since the case only gave rise to questions of law, an oral hearing could not have assisted the Supreme Administrative Court in its examination.\n20. The applicant and the Commission considered that the right to a fair and public hearing in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) meant that a party must as a rule be entitled to present his arguments orally before a court at a hearing which must be public. Since the Supreme Administrative Court had been the only tribunal dealing with the applicant\u2019s case, his being denied an oral hearing constituted a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The applicant, in addition, stressed that the lack of a hearing had meant that the Supreme Administrative Court had failed to review all the aspects of the case.\n21. It is clearly established under the Court\u2019s existing case-law that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201c in the sense of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may entail an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201c (see, for instance, the H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, para. 64). In the present case the Court sees no need to go beyond an examination of whether, in the particular circumstances, the fact that the applicant was denied an opportunity to present oral argument before the Supreme Administrative Court gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n22. In this regard, the Court observes that the Supreme Administrative Court acted as the first and only judicial instance in the contested proceedings. As the Government conceded, its jurisdiction was not limited to matters of law, but also extended to factual issues (see paragraph 12 above). In the particular case, as appears from the applicant\u2019s submissions to the Supreme Administrative Court, his appeal was capable of raising issues of both fact and law in relation to the Government\u2019s decision of 21 June 1989 (see paragraph 8 above). This is shown by the opinion expressed by the minority, to the effect that it was necessary to obtain, inter alia by means of an oral hearing, clarifications on certain points, which in their view were essential (see paragraph 9 above).\nThe Court is of the view that, in such circumstances at least, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) guarantees a right to an oral hearing. Accordingly, the refusal by the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case constituted a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)\n23. Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention reads:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\n#### A. Non-pecuniary damage\n24. The applicant did not seek compensation for pecuniary damage, being unable to prove that the Supreme Administrative Court would have ruled in his favour had it held a hearing in his case. However, he maintained that, in the event of an oral hearing, it would have had to determine the dispute between him and the County Administrative Board as to the exact nature of the requirements of the restoration plan (see paragraph 9 above). He also laid stress on the fact that this would be the second time Sweden had been found to have violated his rights under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. For these reasons he claimed 50,000 Swedish kronor for non-pecuniary damage.\n25. The Government agreed to pay some compensation for non-pecuniary damage, the amount to be assessed in the light of what had been awarded by the Court in previous cases against Sweden concerning the lack of access to a court. The Commission\u2019s Delegate agreed that compensation should be awarded.\n26. The Court, making an assessment on an equitable basis, awards the applicant 15,000 kronor for non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n27. The applicant claimed, in addition, reimbursement of costs and expenses, totalling 196,852 kronor, in respect of the following items:\n(a) 45,100 kronor to cover costs referable to the proceedings before the County Administrative Board and the Government, namely 21,700 kronor for lawyer\u2019s fees and also 14,400 kronor and 9,000 kronor for the fees of two experts, respectively, for technical assistance and an opinion;\n(b) 131,250 kronor for lawyer\u2019s fees for work done in connection with representing him before the Convention institutions;\n(c) 20,502 kronor for travel and subsistence expenses relating to his lawyer\u2019s and his own journey to Strasbourg to appear before the Court.\n28. As to item (a) the Government considered that this claim must be rejected altogether, whereas the Delegate was of the view that not all the domestic costs were recoverable. On the other hand, both the Government and the Delegate agreed that item (b) should be reimbursed, though, in their opinion, the amount claimed was excessive.\n29. With regard to item (a), the Court finds that it is only in so far as the domestic costs related to the request for an oral hearing that these were necessarily incurred in order to avoid the violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (see paragraph 22 above). For this and item (b), the Court, making an assessment on an equitable basis, awards the applicant 100,000 kronor. Item (c), which is undisputed, should be recovered in its entirety.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention;\n2. Holds that Sweden is to pay to the applicant, within three months, 15,000 (fifteen thousand) Swedish kronor for non-pecuniary damage and 120,502 (one hundred and twenty thousand, five hundred and two) kronor for costs and expenses;\n3. Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 February 1994.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nMarc-Andr\u00e9 EISSEN\nRegistrar", "001-67200": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF MILLER AND OTHERS\nv.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 5 October 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 which regulated court-martial procedures at the relevant time are set out in the above-cited Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n17. Following the Commission's report in the Findlay case (Findlay v. the United Kingdom, no. 22107/93, Commission's report of 5 September 1995), it was decided that, as and from 1 January 1996, all courts-martial would be composed of presidents and members not in the chain of command of the convening officer. Thereafter, the 1955 Act was amended substantially by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) which came into force on 1 April 1997. The new court-martial system for which the 1996 Act provides is summarised in the Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 52-57) and is outlined in more detail in the case of Cooper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 48843/99, \u00a7\u00a7 15-76, ECHR 2003-XII).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicants complained that they had not been afforded a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law: they considered their courts-martial to lack structural independence and objective impartiality and they relied on the above-cited Findlay judgment. The Government disagreed.\n19. Article 6 \u00a7 1, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. Other than arguing that the complaint was manifestly ill-founded, the Government did not raise any other objection to its admissibility.\n21. It is not disputed that the final decision in the applicants' proceedings was that of the CMAC of 13 November 1998. Their complaints were introduced on 11 January 1999 and, therefore, within the six-month time-limit set down by Article 34 of the Convention. In addition, the Court is of the view that, given the nature of the charges (serious criminal charges under domestic law) together with the nature and severity of the penalties imposed (serious sentences of imprisonment), their courts-martial determined criminal charges against them within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83 and, more recently, Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], Nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7 69-130, ECHR 2003-X and the above-cited Cooper v. the United Kingdom judgment, \u00a7 80.)\n22. The Court considers that the applicants' case raises a question of law which is sufficiently serious that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits and no other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established. The Court therefore declares the case admissible.\nIn accordance with its decision to apply Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 3 above), the Court will immediately consider the merits of this complaint.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Government mainly argued that the present cases were distinguishable from the above-cited Findlay case given the policy in place from 1 January 1996 to the effect that the president and members of the applicants' courts-martial were not in the convening officer's chain of command (although they were lower in rank to that officer) and were also all outside the \u201cchain of command area\u201d of the applicants. In addition, the convening officer could only dissolve the court-martial in prescribed circumstances. The post-trial review procedure did not affect the independence of a court-martial, the Court's misgivings in Findlay arising from the role of the convening officer as opposed to any post-trial procedures. They further considered that the delivery of the above-cited Cooper judgment confirmed their point of view.\n24. The applicants disagreed with the Government's interpretation of the Findlay judgment (they were of the view that the change in practice after January 1996 was insufficient to overcome the difficulties identified in that judgment) and also considered the Government's reliance on the above-cited Cooper judgment to be misplaced (since that latter case concerned the post-1996 Act system and their case concerned the system in place prior to the 1996 Act). In any event, they maintained that an entirely military court-martial could not try criminal charges compatibly with the independence requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n25. In addition, the applicants pointed out that Presidents of courts-martial were not legally qualified and their presence was difficult to justify given the presence of judge advocates. The rank structure of courts-martial put pressure on the junior members. The judge advocates were not members and had no vote on findings or sentence. No reasons were given for the sentences imposed and the judge advocate's advice to the courts-martial was not made public. No reasons were given for the rejection of the applicants' petitions prior to the CMAC proceedings. They had no right to appeal to the CMAC against sentence only. The applicants further argued that the post-trial review procedures themselves breached certain fundamental principles of Article 6 of the Convention.\n26. The Court notes, at the outset, that it has recently rejected the submission, repeated by the present applicants, that service tribunals could not, by definition, try criminal charges against service personnel consistently with the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (the Cooper judgment, at \u00a7\u00a7 108-110).\n27. The Court recalls the relevant Convention principles concerning the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see the above-cited Cooper judgment, \u00a7 104):\n\u201c...in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered \u201cindependent\u201d, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and to the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence.\n... what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified ... .\u201d\n... the tribunal ... must ... be impartial from an objective viewpoint in that it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect ...\n28. Since the concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked, the Court will consider them together in the present case.\n29. The Court observes that the applicants were tried by courts-martial convened under the system for which the 1955 Act provided, prior to its amendment by the 1996 Act. Mr Findlay's trial by court-martial under that system was found incompatible with the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the above-cited Findlay case and, consequently, with the fairness requirement of that provision.\nIn particular, in that case, the Court was mainly concerned about the significant and conflicting roles of the convening officer in court-martial proceedings: he had a key prosecuting role and at the same time appointed members of courts-martial who were subordinate in rank to him and fell within his chain of command. He also had the power \u201calbeit in prescribed circumstances\u201d to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial. It was further considered \u201csignificant\u201d that he acted as \u201cconfirming officer\u201d after the trial: a court-martial's verdict and sentence were not effective until \u201cconfirmed\u201d by that officer and he could vary the sentence imposed by court-martial as he saw fit. The Court considered this contrary to the \u201cwell-established principle\u201d that the power to give a binding decision not alterable by a non-judicial authority was inherent in the notion of \u201ctribunal\u201d and could also be seen as a component of the \u201cindependence\u201d required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nSuch \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d in the court-martial system could not be remedied by the presence of safeguards (such as the involvement of the judge advocate who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public), by the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board or by any subsequent review proceedings (the court-martial was concerned with serious charges classified as \u201ccriminal\u201d under both domestic and Convention law so that the applicant was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1). The Court concluded that \u201cfor all these reasons, and in particular the central role played by the convening officer in the organisation of the court martial\u201d, Mr Findlay's misgivings about the independence and impartiality of his court-martial were objectively justified.\n30. The parties disputed whether the present applications could be distinguished from the Findlay case since no member of the present courts-martial was in the chain of command of the convening officer. Having regard to the above-described reasoning in the Findlay judgment, the Court considers it clear that this factor is not sufficient by itself to distinguish the present from the Findlay case. The convening officer retained a key prosecuting role while appointing members of the applicants' courts-martial who remained subordinate in rank to him. He could still \u201calbeit in prescribed circumstances\u201d have dissolved the applicants' courts-martial. In addition, he continued to act as confirming officer: the present applicants' verdict and sentence were therefore not effective until \u201cconfirmed\u201d by that officer and he had the power to vary their sentences as he saw fit.\n31. Having regard also to the fundamental nature of the changes (introduced by the 1996 Act) which were later found to render the army and air-force court-martial system compatible with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 which were introduced by the 1996 Act (see the above-cited Cooper judgment, at \u00a7\u00a7 111-134), the Court considers that the present applicants' misgivings about the independence and impartiality of their courts-martial, convened under the 1955 Act, were objectively justified. Their courts-martial proceedings were, consequently, unfair. It is not therefore necessary to examine their additional submissions (outlined at paragraph 25 above).\n32. In sum, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n33. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n34. The applicants did not claim to have suffered any pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage.\n35. They claimed reimbursement of a total sum of 7713.05 pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d) inclusive of value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) for their legal costs and expenses incurred before the Court. A breakdown of the legal work done was provided (including telephone calls and letters and amounting to a total of almost 40 hours work), as was the charge-out rate (GBP160/hour).\n36. The Government considered excessive both the hourly charge-out rate (inter alia, most of the work had been completed some years ago) and the hours of work for which the applicant claimed reimbursement (given, inter alia, the overlap between the applicants' cases and the relative brevity of the parties' observations in the cases).\n37. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses shown to have been actually and necessarily incurred and to be reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, and noting in particular the similarity of the three present applications and their relative lack of novelty in view of the above-cited Findlay judgment, the Court considers it reasonable to award the total sum of EUR 4000 (inclusive of VAT) for costs and expenses in the applicants' proceedings before the Court, this sum to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.\n#### C. Default interest\n38. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the applications admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the total sum of EUR 4000 (four thousand euros) in respect of all of their costs and expenses (inclusive of VAT), this sum to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 26 October 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O'Boyle Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4\nRegistrar President", "001-61680": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HIRST v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 December 2003 and on 9 March 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ...is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\nThis section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which back dated to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n18. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)c).\n19. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000, which permitted remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the Government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, a statement that in introducing the measure in Parliament the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n20. On 22 February 2001, the Secretary of State gave his reasons for maintaining the policy of disenfranchising convicted prisoners:\n\u201cBy committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender\u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence, such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period. There is more than one element to punishment than forcible detention. Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society, amongst which is the right to vote for one\u2019s representative.\u201d\n21. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d)\n22. Relevant provisions of the ICCPR provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\u201d\n23. In the General Comment (No. 25(57)) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40(4) of the ICCPR dated 27 August 1996, the Committtee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.\u201d\n#### B. European Prison Rules (1987, Recommendation R(87)3 Council of Europe)\n\u201c64. Imprisonment is by the deprivation of liberty a punishment in itself. The conditions of imprisonment and the prison regimes shall not, therefore, except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in this.\u201d\n#### C. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters\n24. This document adopted by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) at its 51st Plenary Session (5-6 July 2002) and submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 6 November 2002 includes the Commission\u2019s guidelines as to the circumstances in which there may be deprivation of the right to vote or to be elected:\n\u201cd. ...\ni. provision may be made for depriving individuals of their right to vote and to be elected, but only subject to the following cumulative conditions;\nii. it must be provided for by law;\niii. the proportionality principle must be observed; conditions for disenfranchising individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them;\niv. The deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence.\nv. Furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law.\u201d\n#### D. Sauv\u00e9 v. the Attorney General of Canada (No. 2)\n25. Following the decision of the Administrative Court in the present case, the Supreme Court of Canada on 31 October 2002 held by five votes to four that section 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act 1985, which denied the right to vote to every person imprisoned in a correctional institution serving a sentence of two years or more, was unconstitutional, i.e., infringing Articles 1 and 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:\n\u201c1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\u201d\n\u201c3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein.\u201d\n26. The majority opinion given by McLachlin C.J. is summarised as follows in the headnote:\n\u201cTo justify the infringement of a Charter right under s. 1, the government must show that the infringement achieves a constitutionally valid purpose or objective, and that the chosen means are reasonable and demonstrably justified. The government\u2019s argument that denying the right to vote to penitentiary inmates requires deference because it is a matter of social and political philosophy is rejected. While deference may be appropriate on a decision involving competing social and political policies, it is not appropriate on a decision to limit fundamental rights. The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the rule of law and cannot be lightly set aside. Limits on it require not deference, but careful examination. The framers of the Charter signalled the special importance of this right not only by its broad, untrammelled language, but by exempting it from legislative override under s. 33\u2019s notwithstanding clause. The argument that the philosophically-based or symbolic nature of the objectives in itself commands deference is also rejected. Parliament cannot use lofty objectives to shield legislation from Charter scrutiny. Here, s. 51 (e) is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\nThe government has failed to identify particular problems that require denying the right to vote, making it hard to conclude that the denial is directed at a pressing and substantial purpose. In the absence of a specific problem, the government asserts two broad objectives for s. 51(e): (1) to enhance civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law; and (2) to provide additional punishment or \u2018enhance the general purposes of the criminal sanction\u2019. Vague and symbolic objectives, however, make the justification analysis difficult. The first objective could be asserted of virtually every criminal law and many non-criminal measures. Concerning the second objective, nothing in the record discloses precisely why Parliament felt that more punishment was required for this particular class of prisoner, or what additional objectives Parliament hoped to achieve by this punishment that were not accomplished by the sentences already imposed. Nevertheless, rather than dismissing the government\u2019s objectives outright, prudence suggests that we proceed to the proportionality inquiry.\nSection 51(e) does not meet the proportionality test. In particular, the government fails to establish a rational connection between s. 51(e)\u2019s denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives. With respect to the first objective of promoting civic responsibility and respect for the law, denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values. The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote. To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility. The government\u2019s novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness, equality, and citizen participation. That not all self-proclaimed democracies adhere to this conclusion says little about what the Canadian vision of democracy embodied in the Charter permits. Moreover, the argument that only those who respect the law should participate in the political process cannot be accepted. Denial of the right to vote on the basis of attributed moral unworthiness is inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lies at the heart of Canadian democracy and the Charter. It also runs counter to the plain words of s. 3 of the Charter, its exclusion from the s. 33 override, and the idea that laws command obedience because they are made by those whose conduct they govern.\nWith respect to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment, the government offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of state punishment. Denying the right to vote does not comply with the requirements for legitimate punishment - namely, that punishment must not be arbitrary and must serve a valid criminal law purpose. Absence of arbitrariness requires that punishment be tailored to the acts and circumstances of the individual offender. Section 51(e) qua punishment bears little relation to the offender\u2019s particular crime. As to a legitimate penal purpose, neither the record nor common sense supports the claim that disenfranchisement deters crime or rehabilitates criminals. By imposing a blanket punishment on all penitentiary inmates regardless of the particular crimes they committed, the harm they caused, or the normative character of their conduct, s. 51(e) does not meet the requirements of denunciatory, retributive punishment, and is not rationally connected to the government\u2019s stated goal.\nThe impugned provision does not minimally impair the right to vote. Section 51(e) is too broad, catching many people who, on the government\u2019s own theory, should not be caught. Section 51(e) cannot be saved by the mere fact that it is less restrictive than a blanket exclusion of all inmates from the franchise.\nLastly, the negative effects of denying citizens the right to vote would greatly outweigh the tenuous benefits that might ensue. Denying prisoners the right to vote imposes negative costs on prisoners and on the penal system. It removes a route to social development and undermines correctional law and policy directed towards rehabilitation and integration. In light of the disproportionate number of Aboriginal people in penitentiaries, the negative effects of s. 51(e) upon prisoners have a disproportionate impact on Canada\u2019s already disadvantaged Aboriginal population. ...\u201d\n27. The minority opinion given by Gonthier J. is summarised, in extract, as follows:\n\u201c...In this case, while it has been conceded that s. 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act infringes s. 3 of the Charter, the infringement is a reasonable limit that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The objectives of s. 51(e) are pressing and substantial. Both objectives are based upon a reasonable and rational social or political philosophy. The first objective, that of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, relates to the promotion of good citizenship. The social rejection of serious crime reflects a moral line which safeguards the social contract and the rule of law and bolsters the importance of the nexus between individuals and the community. The \u2018promotion of civic responsibility\u2019 may be abstract or symbolic, but symbolic or abstract purposes can be valid of their own accord and must not be downplayed simply for the reason of their being symbolic. The second objective is the enhancement of the general purposes of the criminal sanction. Section 51(e) clearly has a punitive aspect with a retributive function. It is a valid objective for Parliament to develop appropriate sanctions and punishments for serious crime. The disenfranchisement is a civil disability arising from the criminal conviction.\nSection 51(e) meets the proportionality tests. First, the impugned legislation is rationally connected to the objectives. While a causal relationship between disenfranchising prisoners and the objectives is not empirically demonstrable, reason, logic and common sense, as well as extensive expert evidence, support a conclusion that there is a rational connection between disenfranchising offenders incarcerated for serious crimes and the objectives of promoting civic responsibility and the rule of law and the enhancement of the general objectives of the penal sanction. ... Further, the disenfranchisement of serious criminal offenders serves to deliver a message to both the community and the offenders themselves that serious criminal activity will not be tolerated by the community. Society may choose to curtail temporarily the availability of the vote to serious criminals to insist that civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, as goals worthy of pursuit, are prerequisites to democratic participation. With respect to the second objective, the disenfranchisement is carefully tailored to apply to perpetrators of serious crimes, and there is evidence in the record indicating that the denial of the right to vote is perceived as meaningful by the prisoners themselves and can therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners. Lastly, many other democracies have, by virtue of choosing some form of prisoner disenfranchisement, also identified a connection between objectives similar to those advanced in the case at bar and the means of prisoner disenfranchisement.\nSecond, the impairment of the Charter right is minimal. ... Only \u2018serious offenders\u2019, as determined by Parliament, are subject to disenfranchisement. Since Parliament has drawn a two-year cut off line which identifies which incarcerated offenders have committed serious enough crimes to warrant being deprived of the vote, any alternative line will not be of equal effectiveness. ... The provision is reasonably tailored insofar as disenfranchisement reflects the length of the sentence and actual incarceration, which, in turn, reflect the seriousness of the crime perpetrated and the intended progress towards the ultimate goals of rehabilitation and reintegration. Section 51(e) is not arbitrary: it is related directly to particular categories of conduct. The two-year cut off line also reflects several practical considerations. Further, since this Court gave the impression that it was up to a Parliament to do exactly this after the first Sauv\u00e9 case..., there is a need for deference to Parliament in its drawing of a line. The analysis of social and political philosophies and the accommodation of values in the context of the Charter must be sensitive to the fact that there may be many possible reasonable and rational balances. Line drawing, amongst a range of acceptable alternatives, is for Parliament, ...\nThird, when the objective and the salutary effects are viewed in the totality of the context, they outweigh the temporary disenfranchisement of the serious criminal offender. The enactment of the measure is itself a salutary effect. The legislation intrinsically expresses societal values in relation to serious criminal behaviour and the right to vote in our society. Value emerges from the signal or message that those who commit serious crimes will temporarily lose one aspect of the political equality of citizens. Furthermore, the temporary disenfranchisement is perceived as meaningful by the offenders themselves and could have an ongoing positive rehabilitative effect. ... The statistical data mentioned by the Federal Court of Appeal indicate that the provision catches serious and repeat offenders and that most prisoners will only be deprived of participation in one election. Because the duration of the disenfranchisement is directly related to the duration of incarceration, a serious criminal offender may never actually be denied the opportunity to vote if there is no election during the time he is incarcerated. In light of the special context of this case - that the justification advanced by Parliament is rooted in a social or political philosophy that is not susceptible to proof in the traditional sense - deference is appropriate since the impugned provision raises questions of penal philosophy and policy. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n28. The applicant complains that he has been disenfranchised, invoking Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 which provides:\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n29. The applicant submitted that the right to vote was one of the most fundamental rights which underpinned a truly democratic society. It was not a privilege, contrary to the view expressed by the Secretary of State in February 2001. The restriction in voting rights, which did not apply to unconvicted prisoners, did not pursue any legitimate aim. Little thought had in fact been given to the disenfranchisement of prisoners at all by the legislature, the 1983 Act being a consolidating act adopted without debate on the point.\n30. The reason given by the Government was that the disenfranchisement of a convicted prisoner was considered as part of his punishment and that it aimed to enhance civic responsibility. The applicant however disputed that punishment could legitimately remove fundamental rights other than the deprivation of liberty and argued that this was inconsistent with the stated rehabilitative aim of prison. There was not any evidence that the ban pursued the purported aims nor any link shown between the removal of the vote and the prevention of crime or respect for the rule of law. Most courts and citizens were totally unaware that loss of voting rights accompanied the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. Indeed the applicant argued that the ban took away civic responsibility and eroded respect for the rule of law, serving to alienate prisoners further from society.\n31. The blanket ban was also disproportionate, arbitrary and impaired the essence of the right. It was unrelated to the nature or seriousness of the offence and varied in its effects on prisoners depending on whether their imprisonment coincided with an election. It potentially deprived a significant proportion of the population (some 74,000) of a voice or the possibility of challenging, electorally, the penal policy which affected them. In addition, the applicant submitted that, as a post-tariff prisoner, the punishment element of his sentence had expired and he was held on grounds of risk in which case no alleged justification of punishment could remain either. He referred to a trend in Canada (with particular emphasis on the decision of the Supreme Court in Sauv\u00e9 No. 2 holding to be unconstitutional a bar imposed on prisoners sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment or more), South Africa and other European states to enfranchise prisoners, claiming that 19 countries operated no ban while eight had a partial or specific ban. He concluded that there was no convincing reason, beyond punishment, to remove the vote from convicted prisoners and that this additional sanction was not in keeping with the idea that the punishment of imprisonment was the deprivation of liberty and that the prisoner did not thereby forfeit any other of his fundamental rights save in so far as this was necessitated by considerations of security etc.\n##### 2. The Government\n32. The Government submitted that under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 the right to vote was not absolute and that a wide margin of appreciation was to be allowed to Contracting States in determining the conditions under which the right to vote was exercised. A wide margin should be accorded as the decision to impose limits was that of the legislature which deserved to be given particular weight and as an extensive variation in practice existed between Contracting States in relation to convicted prisoners \u2013 some 18 countries imposed no restriction, 13 prohibited all prisoners from voting, with some restrictions imposable in another 12. A variety of approaches was also taken by democratic states outside Europe. Insofar as the applicant relied on the Canadian case, Sauv\u00e9 No. 2, they pointed out that it was a narrow decision by five votes to four, with a strong dissenting judgment referring to the diverse practice in Europe and that it concerned a differently framed domestic human rights instrument to which the margin of appreciation was not applicable.\n33. The Government stated that the policy has been adhered to over many years with the explicit approval of Parliament, most recently in the Representation of the People Act 2000, which was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the Human Rights Act, indicating that the Secretary of State considered it to be compatible with the Convention. They argued that the disqualification in this case pursued the intertwined legitimate aims of preventing crime and punishing offenders and enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, by depriving those who have breached the basic rules of society of the right to have a say in the way such rules are made for the duration of their sentence. Convicted prisoners had breached the social contract and so could be regarded as (temporarily) forfeiting the right to take part in the government of the country. These aims were accepted as legitimate in the case-law of the Commission.\n34. The measure was also proportionate as it only affected those who had been convicted of crimes sufficiently serious, in the individual circumstances, to warrant an immediate custodial sentence, excluding those subject to fines, suspended sentences, community service or detention for contempt of court as well as fine defaulters and remand prisoners. Moreover as soon as prisoners ceased to be detained the legal incapacity was removed. The duration was fixed by the court at the time of sentencing. It thus did not completely bar voting for life save for a small category of the most serious offenders and should be regarded as a restriction on the right to vote which did not impair the essence of the right, which was to allow the free expression of the opinion of the people in a general election.\n35. As regards the allegedly arbitrary effects, the Government argued that, unless the Court were to hold that there was no margin of appreciation at all in this context, it had to be accepted that a line must be drawn somewhere. Finally, the impact on this particular applicant was not disproportionate since he was imprisoned for life and would not, in any event, have benefited from a more tailored ban, such as that in Austria, affecting those sentenced for over one year.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles\n36. While Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 is phrased in terms of the obligation of the High Contracting Party to hold elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people, the Court\u2019s case-law establishes that it guarantees individual rights, including the right to vote and to stand for election. Although those rights are central to democracy and the rule of law, they are not absolute and may be subject to limitations. The Contracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, but it is for the Court to determine in the last resort whether the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 have been complied with; it has to satisfy itself that the conditions do not curtail the rights in question to such an extent as to impair their very essence and deprive them of their effectiveness; that they are imposed in pursuit of a legitimate aim; and that the means employed are not disproportionate (see Mathieu-Mohin and Clerfayt v. Belgium, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 113, p. 23, \u00a7 52; and more recently, Matthews v. United Kingdom [GC], no. 24833/94, \u00a7 63, ECHR 1999-I; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 201, ECHR 2000-IV, and Podkolzina v. Latvia, no. 46726/99, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002-II).\n##### 2. Application in the present case\n37. The Court recalls that pursuant to section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 the applicant is prevented from voting at any parliamentary or local election as he is serving a prison sentence, in his case, a life sentence. Local elections falling outside the scope of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, the Court\u2019s examination has focussed on whether this bar on the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to vote in parliamentary elections complies with the requirements identified above.\n38. It observes that there have been few recent or directly relevant cases on this type of disenfranchisement. In the case of M.D.U. v. Italy (no. 58540/00, decision of 28 January 2003) the Fourth Section rejected complaints of a judge-imposed bar on voting under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 where the applicant had been convicted of fiscal fraud offences and sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment, with the additional penalty of prohibition of exercising public functions for two years. In two old cases, predating the judgment in Mathieu-Mohin, the Commission considered that it was open to the legislature to remove political rights from persons convicted of \u201cuncitizenlike conduct\u201d (gross abuse in their exercise of public life during the Second World War) and from a person sentenced to eight months\u2019 imprisonment for refusing to report for military service, where reference was made to the notion of dishonour that certain convictions carried with them for a specific period and which might be taken into account by the legislature in respect of the exercise of political rights (no. 6573/74, Commission decision of 19 December 1974, Decisions and Reports (DR) 1, p. 87, and no. 9914/82, Commission decision of 4 July 1983, DR 33, p. 245). In Patrick Holland v. Ireland (no. 24927/94, Commission decision of 14 April 1998, DR 93, p. 15), where, since there was no provision permitting a serving prisoner to vote in prison, the applicant, who was sentenced to seven years for possessing explosives, was de facto deprived of the vote, the Commission found that the suspension of the right to vote did not thwart the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature and could not be considered arbitrary in the circumstances of the case. The Court would observe that the Commission in that case, by confining itself to the question of whether the bar was arbitrary, omitted to give attention to elements of the test laid down in Mathieu-Mohin, namely, the legitimacy of the aim and the proportionality of the measure.\n39. The Court therefore considers that it must look afresh at the issues arising from an automatic statutory bar on voting imposed on convicted prisoners.\n40. As a preliminary remark, concerning the margin of appreciation, it notes the divergences existing in the law and practice within Contracting States. At one end of the spectrum, there are some 18 countries in which no restrictions are imposed on prisoners\u2019 rights to vote; in some 13 countries prisoners are not able to vote, due to operation of law or lack of enabling provisions; and between these extremes in the remainder of Contracting States loss of voting rights is tailored to specific offences or categories of offences or a discretion is left to the sentencing court. This lack of clear consensus underlines the importance of the margin of appreciation afforded to national legislatures in laying down conditions governing the right of franchise (see, mutatis mutandis, Wingrove v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 58).\n41. That said however, the Court does not consider that a Contracting State may rely on the margin of appreciation to justify restrictions on the right to vote which have not been the subject of considered debate in the legislature and which derive, essentially, from unquestioning and passive adherence to a historic tradition. The Court has had occasion in many cases to underline the importance, in the interpretation and application of Convention rights, of \u201cdemocratic values\u201d (for example, Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, \u00a7 87), including the crucial role played by elected representatives in defending the interests of the electorate (for example, Jerusalem v. Austria, no. 26958/95, ECHR 2001-I, \u00a7 36; see also A. v. the United Kingdom, no. 35373/97, ECHR 2002-X, concerning the legitimate measures of protection which attach to the performance of parliamentary functions). The right to vote for those elected representatives must also be acknowledged as being the indispensable foundation of a democratic system. Any devaluation or weakening of that right threatens to undermine that system and it should not be lightly or casually removed.\n(a) Legitimate aim\n42. Turning first to the question of whether the restriction in this case pursues a legitimate aim, the Court recalls that the Government have asserted that there are two aims: the first is to prevent crime and punish offenders; the other is to enhance civil responsibility and respect for the rule of law \u201cby depriving those who have seriously breached the basic rules of society of the right to have a say in the way such rules are made for the duration of their sentence\u201d. The former aim was reflected in the statement made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when the Representation of the People Act 2000 was under consideration (paragraph 19 above).\n43. In this context, the Court has found that the Canadian Supreme Court judgment in Sauv\u00e9 No. 2 provides a detailed, and helpful, examination of the purposes pursued by prisoner disenfranchisement (see paragraphs 24-26 above) While, as the Government pointed out, the decision was taken by five votes to four, it may be noted that this was in relation to a less restrictive bar imposed on prisoners (those sentenced to two years or more) and that in the first Sauv\u00e9 case, concerning a blanket bar on all convicted prisoners, the decision was unanimous. Taking due account of the difference in text and structure of the Canadian Charter, the Court nonetheless finds that substance of the reasoning may be regarded as apposite in the present case.\n44. As regards the purpose of preventing crime and punishing offenders by imposing the additional punishment of removal of the right to vote, the Convention organs have emphasised in a number of different contexts that the fact that a convicted prisoner is deprived of his liberty does not mean that he loses the protection of other fundamental rights in the Convention, even though the enjoyment of those rights must inevitably be tempered by the requirements of his situation. The mere fact of imprisonment has not been found sufficient to justify the imposition of blanket restrictions on the right of a prisoner to correspond (Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A, no. 61), to have effective access to a lawyer or to court (Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, 28 June 1984, Series A, no. 80; Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, Series A, no. 18), to have access to his family (X. v. the United Kingdom, no. 9054/80, Commission decision of 8 October 1982, DR 30, p. 113), to practise his religion (Poltoratskiy v. Ukraine, no. 38812/97, ECHR 2003-..., \u00a7\u00a7 167-171), to exercise freedom of expression (T. v. the United Kingdom, no. 8231/78, Commission report, 12 October 1983, DR 49, p. 5, \u00a7\u00a7 44-84) or to marry (Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Commission report, 13 December 1979, DR 24, p. 5; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Commission report, 10 July 1980, DR 24, p. 72).\n45. It may be noted that the loss of the right to vote plays no overt role in the sentencing process in criminal cases in the United Kingdom. The majority in the Sauv\u00e9 case also found no evidence to support the claim that disenfranchisement deterred crime and considered that the imposition of a blanket punishment on all prisoners regardless of their crime or individual circumstances indicated no rational link between the punishment and the offender.\n46. As regards the purpose of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, there is no clear, logical link between the loss of vote and the imposition of a prison sentence, where no bar applies to a person guilty of crimes which may be equally anti-social or \u201cuncitizen-like\u201d but whose crime is not met by such a consequence. There is much force in the arguments of the majority in Sauv\u00e9 that removal of the vote in fact runs counter to the rehabilitation of the offender as a law-abiding member of the community and undermines the authority of the law as derived from a legislature which the community as a whole votes into power.\n47. Notwithstanding its doubts as to the validity of either aim in the modern day however, the Court notes the varying political and penal philosophies and policies that may be invoked in this context and for the purposes of the present case would refrain from ruling that these aims cannot be regarded as legitimate, even on an abstract or symbolic plane. It leaves the question open as it is unnecessary to decide it in the present case, for the reasons set out below.\n(b) Proportionality\n48. The Court notes that the restriction as applied in the United Kingdom does distinguish between different reasons for detention and varying types of crime and may be regarded as less draconian than the regime applying in certain other jurisdictions; it affects only those convicted of crimes sufficiently serious to warrant an immediate custodial sentence; it does not apply to prisoners on remand, those imprisoned for default in paying fines or those detained for contempt of court. Furthermore the incapacity is removed as soon as the prisoner ceases to be detained.\n49. Nonetheless, the provision strips of their Convention right to vote a large category of persons (over 70,000) in a manner which is indiscriminate. It imposes a blanket restriction on all convicted prisoners. It applies automatically to all such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence and irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence. As pointed out in the Canadian courts, the actual effect on an individual prisoner\u2019s right to vote will depend, somewhat arbitrarily, on the period during which he happens to serve his sentence. A prisoner sentenced to a week\u2019s imprisonment for a minor infraction may lose the right to vote if detained over election day whereas a prisoner serving several years for a more serious crime may, by chance, avoid missing an election. An additional anomaly arises in this case, where the applicant, serving a life sentence, has completed that part of sentence relating to punishment and continues to be detained only on grounds of his continuing danger to society. Insofar as a disqualification from voting is to be seen as part of a prisoner\u2019s punishment, there is no logical justification for it to continue in the case of the present applicant. The justification offered by the Government is that such prisoners may properly be denied a vote while they remain detained because of the danger which they present. The Court does not find this a convincing argument, in particular as it has not been explained how this falls under the aims advanced by the Government.\n50. The Government have argued, in effect relying on the margin of appreciation, that it must be permissible for the legislature to draw the line at some point concerning prisoners and that, in any event, this applicant, who has committed a very serious offence and received a life sentence, has not suffered any detriment as he would have lost his right to vote under a more narrowly defined restriction.\n51. The Court accepts that this is an area in which a wide margin of appreciation should be granted to the national legislature in determining whether restrictions on prisoners\u2019 right to vote can still be justified in modern times and if so how a fair balance is to be struck. In particular, it should be for the legislature to decide whether any restriction on the right to vote should be tailored to particular offences, or offences of a particular gravity or whether, for instance, the sentencing court should be left with an overriding discretion to deprive a convicted person of his right to vote. The Court would observe that there is no evidence that the legislature in the United Kingdom has ever sought to weigh the competing interests or to assess the proportionality of the ban as it affects convicted prisoners. It cannot accept however that an absolute bar on voting by any serving prisoner in any circumstances falls within an acceptable margin of appreciation. The applicant in the present case lost his right to vote as the result of the imposition of an automatic and blanket restriction on convicted prisoners\u2019 franchise and may therefore claim to be a victim of the measure. The Court cannot speculate as to whether the applicant would still have been deprived of the vote even if a more limited restriction on the right to prisoners to vote had been imposed, which was such as to comply with the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n52. The Court concludes that there has been a breach of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION\n53. The applicant complains that he is discriminated against as a convicted prisoner, invoking Article 14 which provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n54. Having regard to the conclusion above under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the Convention, the Court considers that no separate issue arises under Article 14 and makes no separate finding.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n55. The applicant complains that the disenfranchisement prevents him from exercising his freedom of expression through voting, invoking Article 10 of the Convention which provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. ...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n56. The Court considers that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 may be regarded as the lex specialis as regards the exercise of the right to vote and finds, given its conclusion as to violation of that provision above, that no separate issue arises under Article 10 in the present case.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n57. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n58. The applicant claimed 200 pounds sterling (GBP) as out of pocket expenses (the cost of telephone calls and letters) to his legal representatives and GBP 5,000 for suffering and distress caused by the violation.\n59. The Government were of the view that any finding of a violation should in itself constitute just satisfaction for the applicant. If alternatively the Court were to make an award, it considered the amount should not be more than GBP 1,000.\n60. The Court has considered below the applicant\u2019s claims for his own costs in the proceedings. As regards non-pecuniary damage, the Court notes that it will be for the United Kingdom Government in due course to implement such measures as it considers appropriate to fulfil its obligations to secure the right to vote in compliance with this judgment. In the circumstances, it considers that this may be regarded as providing the applicant with just satisfaction for the breach in this case.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n61. The applicant claimed the costs incurred in the High Court and Court of Appeal in seeking redress in the domestic system in relation to the breach of his rights, namely his solicitors\u2019 and counsels\u2019 fees and expenses in the High Court of GBP 26,115.82 and in the Court of Appeal of GBP 13,203.64. He claimed GBP 18,212.50 in respect of fees and expenses in the proceedings before this Court. This made a total of GBP 62,731.96, inclusive of value-added tax (VAT).\n62. The Government submitted that, as the applicant was legally aided during the domestic proceedings, he did not actually incur any costs. To the extent that the applicant appears to be claiming that further sums should be awarded that were not covered by legal aid, they submitted that any such further costs should not be regarded as necessarily incurred or reasonable as to quantum and that they should be disallowed. As regards the costs in Strasbourg the Government considered that the rate of GBP 300 per hour for 20 hours preparation was excessive, as were the costs and number of days (three) claimed for attendance at the hearing. As not all the applicant\u2019s complaints were declared admissible, they invited the Court to reduce the costs accordingly.\n63. The Court recalls that that only legal costs and expenses found to have been actually and necessarily incurred and which are reasonable as to quantum are recoverable under Article 41 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, 25 March 1999, \u00a7 79, and Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 28, ECHR 2000-IX). This may include domestic legal costs actually and necessarily incurred to prevent or redress the breach of the Convention (see, for example, I.J.L., G.M.R. and A.K.P. v. the United Kingdom (Article 41), nos. 29522/95, 30056/96 and 30574/96, \u00a7 18, 25 September 2001). Since however in the present case the costs of the applicant\u2019s legal representation in his application to the High Court and Court of Appeal contesting his disenfranchisement were paid by the legal aid authorities, it cannot be said that he incurred those expenses and he has not shown that he was required, or remains liable, to pay his representatives any further sums in that regard. This application before the Court cannot be used as a retrospective opportunity to charge fees above the rates allowed by domestic legal aid scales.\n64. As regards the costs claimed for the proceedings in Strasbourg, the Court notes the Government\u2019s objections and finds that the claims may be regarded as unduly high, in particular as regards the claim for three days for a hearing which lasted one morning and the lack of itemisation of work done by the solicitor. While some complaints were declared inadmissible, the applicant\u2019s essential concern and the bulk of the argument centred on the bar on his right to vote, on which point he was successful under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. No deduction has therefore been made on that account. Taking into account the amount of legal aid paid by the Council of Europe and in light of the circumstances of the case, the Court awards 12,000 euros (EUR) inclusive of VAT for legal costs and expenses. In respect of the applicant\u2019s own claim for expenses in pursuing his application, the Court notes the lack of any itemisation but accepts that some costs have been occurred by him. It awards to the applicant himself EUR 144.\n#### C. Default interest\n65. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1;\n##### 2. Holds that no separate issue arises under Article 14 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that no separate issue arises under Article 10 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n##### 5. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(i) EUR 12,000 (twelve thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses incurred by the applicant\u2019s legal representatives;\n(ii) EUR 144 (one hundred and forty four euros) in respect of the applicant\u2019s costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 30 March 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4\nRegistrar President", "001-58086": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ANNE-MARIE ANDERSSON c.

Finland\nIn the case of Anne-Marie Andersson v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court B0, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr B. Walsh,\nMr J. De Meyer,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr A.N. Loizou,\nSir John Freeland,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nand also of Mr H. Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March and 25 June 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. The general principle of freedom of information\n14. Under sections 1 and 2 of chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act (Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen), which is part of the Swedish Constitution, everyone is entitled to access to public documents, subject to exceptions set out in the Secrecy Act (Sekretesslagen, 1980:100).\n#### B. Confidentiality of medical information\n15. One of the exceptions to this general rule relates to confidentiality of information in the field of health and medical care and is set out in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, which provides as follows:\n\u201cSecrecy applies ... in the field of health and medical care to information on the individual's state of health or otherwise concerning his or her private life, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any harm to the individual or persons closely related to him or her ...\u201d\n#### C. The duty to report to the Social Council\n16. Notwithstanding this rule of confidentiality, in certain circumstances health and medical-care authorities are required to submit information to another authority. Thus, chapter 14, section 1, of the Secrecy Act provides the following:\n\u201cSecrecy does not prevent ... the disclosure of information to another authority, if an obligation to disclose the information is laid down in an act of law or a government ordinance.\u201d\n17. Such an obligation follows from section 71 of the Social Services Act 1980 (Socialtj\u00e4nstlagen, 1980:620), subsections 2 and 4 of which read as follows:\n\u201cAuthorities whose activities relate to children and young persons as well as other authorities within health and medical-care and social services are obliged immediately to report to the Social Council if, in the course of their activities, they receive information which may imply that an intervention by the Social Council is necessary for the protection of a minor. This also applies to the employees of such authorities and to physicians, teachers, nurses and midwives who are not so employed.\n...\nAuthorities, employees and practitioners referred to in subsection 2 are obliged to give the Social Council all information which may be of importance to an investigation of a minor's need of protection.\u201d\n18. At the time of the enactment of the Social Services Act, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Health and Welfare (Riksdagens socialutskott) stated that the reporting obligation was not limited to cases where it was clear that the Social Council would have to intervene. In addition, unconfirmed information or information which was difficult to assess should also be reported, if it implied that a child might be in need of support or assistance from the Council. In such cases it would be for the Council to investigate whether there was any factual basis for the information in question and whether there was a need for any particular measure (see the report of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, SoU 1979/80:44, p. 113).\n19. The obligation to report only concerns information which is of relevance to the Social Council's investigation. It does not extend to other information concerning the persons in question (see Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 132). It is for the reporting authority or practitioner to decide which information is covered by the reporting obligation.\n20. Information which is submitted to the Social Council is protected by the rule of confidentiality provided by chapter 7, section 4, of the Secrecy Act:\n\u201cSecrecy applies within the social services to information concerning the individual's private life, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any harm to the individual or persons closely related to him or her ...\u201d\n#### D. Remedies\n21. Under the Freedom of the Press Act and the Secrecy Act, there is a right to appeal against a decision not to grant access to public documents. There is, however, no such right in respect of decisions to grant access to information contained in public documents. Furthermore, there is no right for the individual concerned to be consulted before such information is disclosed or to be notified of the disclosure afterwards.\n22. Under chapter 20, section 3, of the Penal Code (Brottsbalken), a physician who, intentionally or through negligence, discloses information which should be kept confidential according to law is guilty of breach of professional secrecy. Proceedings may be brought in the ordinary courts by the public prosecutor or, if the public prosecutor decides not to prosecute, the aggrieved individual. Such a breach of professional secrecy may also constitute a basis for claiming damages under chapter 2, section 1, or chapter 3, section 1, of the Damage Compensation Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, 1972:207). Action may be taken by the individual against the physician or his or her employer.\n23. Public authorities and their employees are, furthermore, subject to the supervision of the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) and the Parliamentary Ombudsman (Justitieombudsmannen). The Chancellor and the Ombudsman investigate whether those exercising public powers abide by laws and follow applicable instructions and may prosecute a certain individual or refer the matter to disciplinary action by the relevant authority.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n24. Mrs Anne-Marie Andersson lodged her application (no. 20022/92) with the Commission on 11 February 1992. She alleged that the psychiatrist's submission of information to the Social Council without her knowledge or consent constituted a violation of her right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Moreover, she complained that, contrary to Articles 6 and 13, she could not appeal to a court against the psychiatrist's decision to disclose the information.\n25. On 22 May 1995 the Commission declared admissible the applicant's complaints under Articles 6 and 13 and declared the remainder of her application inadmissible. In its report of 11 April 1996 (Article 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (unanimously) and that no separate issue arose under Article 13 of the Convention (twenty votes to seven).\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n26. At the hearing on 18 March 1997 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the Convention in the present case. In the meantime, after learning of the applicant's death and of the fact that her son, Mr Stive Andersson, wished to continue the proceedings on her behalf, the Government objected to his being allowed to do so (see paragraph 6 above).\n27. In her memorial to the Court the applicant's lawyer alleged that there had been violations of Articles 6, 8 and 13 and requested it to make an award of just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention. At the hearing she reiterated her claim that there had been violations of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS\n28. In the Government's submission, those of the applicant's complaints which had been declared admissible by the Commission and which had been referred to the Court were so closely and directly bound up with her person that her son, Mr Stive Andersson, could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable him to continue the proceedings in her stead. Nor did he have any definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention. For these reasons, the Government contested the right of the son to continue before the Court the proceedings which his mother had instituted.\n29. The Court observes that, in so far as declared admissible by the Commission, the applicant's case concerns her complaints under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention about lack of remedies to challenge the disclosure of certain confidential medical data by one public authority to another. In view of its own case-law (see, for instance, the X v. France judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234-C, p. 89, \u00a7 26), the Court accepts that, as the deceased's heir, the son has sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case.\n30. On the other hand, the applicant's complaint that the disclosure of data in question amounted to a violation of Article 8 was declared inadmissible by the Commission (see paragraph 25 above). The Court has therefore no jurisdiction to entertain it under that provision (see, amongst other authorities, the Z v. Finland judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 341, \u00a7 69).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. The applicant contended that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in so far as is relevant, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by [a] \u2026 tribunal ...\u201d\nUnder this provision, she complained that she had not been afforded a possibility, prior to the communication of the psychiatrist's statement to the Social Council, to challenge the measure before a court (see paragraph 21 above).\n32. The Government disputed that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable and maintained that, in any event, it had been complied with in the present case (see paragraphs 22\u201323 above). The Commission, for its part, considered that the provision was applicable and that its requirements had been met (see paragraph 22 above).\n33. The Court must first examine whether Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable to the disagreement between the applicant and the Swedish authorities as to the disclosure of her medical data. It reiterates that, according to the principles laid down in its case-law (see, for instance, the judgments of Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, Series A no. 279-B, p. 38, \u00a7 22, and Keroj\u00e4rvi v. Finland, 19 July 1995, Series A no. 322, p. 12, \u00a7 32), it must ascertain whether there was a dispute (\u201ccontestation\u201d) over a \u201cright\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. Finally, the right must be civil in character.\n34. Under the rule on confidentiality contained in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, a duty of confidentiality applied to the kind of data in issue in the present case (see paragraph 15 above). The provision was evidently designed to protect a patient's interests in non-disclosure of medical data.\n35. On the other hand, according to chapter 14, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, the rule of confidentiality did not apply where a statutory obligation required the disclosure of information to another authority (see paragraph 16 above). In the case under consideration, if the chief psychiatrist possessed information about the applicant patient to the effect that intervention by the Social Council was necessary for the protection of her under-age son, the psychiatrist was under a duty to report immediately to the Social Council. That duty extended to all data in her possession which were potentially relevant to the Social Council's investigation into the need to take protective measures with respect to the son (see paragraphs 17\u201319 above) and depended exclusively on the relevance of those data (section 71, subsections 2 and 4, of the Social Services Act).\n36. In addition to the scope of this obligation, as described above, the Court notes that the psychiatrist enjoyed a very wide discretion in assessing what data would be of importance to the Social Council's investigation (ibid.). In this regard, she had no duty to hear the applicant's views before transmitting the information to the Social Council (see paragraph 21 above).\nAccordingly, it transpires from the terms of the legislation in issue that a \u201cright\u201d to prevent communication of such data could not, on arguable grounds, be said to be recognised under national law (see the Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, pp. 19\u201320, \u00a7\u00a7 49\u201352). No evidence suggesting the contrary has been adduced before the Court.\n37. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court reaches the conclusion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable to the proceedings under consideration and has therefore not been violated in the present case.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. Relying on essentially the same arguments as with regard to Article 6 \u00a7 1, the applicant claimed that there had also been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\nShe maintained that, since the disclosure of confidential data was a measure that could not be reversed, it was crucial for the effectiveness of a remedy against disclosure that the interested person be able to exercise it beforehand.\n39. The Government admitted that if the Court found Article 6 \u00a7 1 inapplicable, a separate issue would arise under Article 13. In that event they maintained that, having regard to the fact that the Commission had declared the applicant's complaint under Article 8 inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, it could not be regarded as an arguable claim for the purposes of Article 13. Consequently, there had been no violation of this provision.\n40. The Court, in view of its conclusion with respect to the applicant's complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see paragraph 37 above), considers that a separate issue arises with regard to her complaint under Article 13.\nArticle 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent \u201cnational authority\u201d both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under Article 13 (see, for instance, the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, pp. 1869\u201370, \u00a7 145).\nHowever, this provision applies only in respect of grievances under the Convention which are arguable (see, for instance, the Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, \u00a7 52). Whether that was so in the case of the applicant's claim under Article 8 has to be determined in the light of the particular facts and the nature of the legal issues raised. In this connection, the Commission's decision on the admissibility of her complaint under Article 8 and the reasoning therein are not decisive but provide significant pointers (ibid., pp. 23\u201324, \u00a7\u00a7 54\u201355).\n41. In declaring the applicant's complaint under Article 8 inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded, the Commission had regard to the following considerations.\nThe interference with the applicant's enjoyment of her right to respect for private life which the disclosure of the data in question entailed was in conformity with Swedish law, namely section 71 of the Social Services Act (see paragraph 17 above), and pursued the legitimate aims of protecting \u201chealth or morals\u201d and the \u201crights and freedoms of others\u201d.\nFurthermore, the Commission observed, the measure had been notified to the applicant (see paragraph 12 above) and had been of a limited nature as the information concerned was not made public but remained protected by the same level of confidentiality as that applicable to psychiatric records. Contrary to the applicant's submission, in order for the Social Council to assess adequately the need for intervention it was necessary to have information not only about her son but also about herself. The psychiatrist's concern that her problems might adversely affect her son was supported by his school's report to the social authorities, which had led to his being placed in a special school with her consent. Having regard to their margin of appreciation, the authorities were entitled to take the view that the measure was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.\n42. The Court for its part finds, on the evidence adduced, that the applicant had no arguable claim in respect of a violation of the Convention. There has thus been no violation of Article 13.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n1. Holds unanimously that the applicant's son, Mr Stive Andersson, had sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case;\n2. Holds by five votes to four that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not applicable in the present case;\n3. Holds by eight votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n4. Holds unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 August 1997.\nSigned: Rolv Ryssdal\nPresident\nSigned: Herbert Petzold\nRegistrar\nIn accordance with Article 51 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 55 \u00a7 2 of Rules of Court B, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n(a) partly concurring and partly dissenting opinion of Mr Ryssdal;\n(b) separate opinion of Mr Walsh;\n###### (c) partly concurring and partly dissenting opinion of Mr Casadevall;\n(d) partly dissenting opinion of Mr De Meyer.\nInitialled: R. R.\nInitialled: H. P.\nPARTLY CONCURRING AND PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE RYSSDAL\n1. I am unable to share the majority's view that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not applicable in the present case. However, I consider that the provision was complied with and therefore concur with the majority's conclusion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 has not been violated.\n2. As regards the question whether an arguable claim existed, I attach weight to the fact, also mentioned in the judgment, that a duty of confidentiality applied to the kind of data in issue and was designed to protect the patient's interests in non-disclosure.\nIt is true that this rule of confidentiality did not apply with regard to information in the psychiatrist's possession which was potentially relevant to the Social Council's investigation into the need to take protective measures with respect to the applicant's under-age son and that the psychiatrist, as the imparting authority, enjoyed a considerable discretion in assessing what data would be of importance to the Social Council's investigation.\nHowever, that discretion was not unfettered and was significantly more circumscribed than that in issue in the case of Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands (judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, pp. 19\u201320, \u00a7\u00a7 49\u201352), referred to in the majority's reasoning. In that case, the issue was whether a suspect, who was subsequently acquitted, had a right to compensation under certain provisions of Netherlands law for damage resulting from detention. A decisive factor leading to the Court's finding that no actual right to compensation was recognised under the national law was that the State had no obligation to pay even if the conditions set out in the relevant provision were fulfilled; an award was contingent on the competent court being of the opinion \u201cthat reasons in equity\u201d exist therefor (ibid., \u00a7 51).\nIn contrast, the scope of the discretion in issue in this case was defined with greater precision. According to the relevant national provisions, a disclosure of medical data by the psychiatrist to the Social Council was permissible only in so far as the information was of importance to the latter's investigation into the need to take protective measures in respect of the son; were the disclosure to exceed those limits it would constitute a breach of the psychiatrist's obligation to maintain the confidentiality of the information.\nIn my view, the applicant could therefore arguably maintain that the national law recognised a right for her to challenge the disclosure of the data communicated by the psychiatrist to the Social Council.\n3. Moreover, the applicant disputed that there was a need to take protective measures with respect to her son. There was thus a serious disagreement between the applicant and the authorities capable of raising issues going to the lawfulness under Swedish law of the psychiatrist's decision to disclose the medical data concerned to the Social Council. That decision was moreover directly decisive for the applicant's right to maintain the confidentiality of the information at the psychiatric clinic. Accordingly, there was a dispute over a \u201cright\u201d.\n4. In addition, I am of the opinion that the right in issue, which concerned the protection of the confidentiality of the applicant's personal medical data, was civil in character.\n5. As to the question of compliance, the remedies available to her did in my view satisfy the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1. By bringing civil and/or criminal proceedings for breach of professional secrecy before the Swedish courts, the applicant would have been able to obtain a review, addressing both questions of fact and of law, of the merits of her claim that the psychiatrist had communicated to the Social Council medical information about her which had not been relevant to the assessment of any need to take protective measures with respect to her son. The fact that the applicant could not bring proceedings before the disclosure of the information to the Social Council did not in my opinion impair the very essence of the \u201cright to a court\u201d.\n6. In the light of the foregoing, I find no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in the present case.\n7. I agree that there has been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention.\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE WALSH\n1. I agree with the opinion of the President to the effect that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was applicable in the present case.\n2. I also agree with his opinion that the applicant failed to avail herself of the remedies available to her by law against the authorities.\n3. There has therefore been no breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n4. In my opinion there has been no breach of Article 13.\nPARTLY CONCURRING AND PARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE CASADEVALL\n(Translation)\n1. Like the President, I consider that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was applicable in the present case. The majority of the Chamber held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not applicable. As I have some doubts on that subject, I prefer to concur in the opinion of the Commission, both on the question of applicability and on the question of compliance with that provision.\n2. Under the Court's case-law, the applicability of Article 6 is subordinated to the effective existence of a dispute (contestation) over a right which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law and which is civil in character. The dispute must, moreover, \u201cbe genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise ...\u201d.\n3. It is not disputed that the confidentiality obligation provided for in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act was applicable in the present case. The contentious provision, as the majority notes, was clearly intended to protect the interest of patients in non-disclosure. Although the exception to that rule contained in section 71 of the Social Services Act (subsections 2 and 4) afforded psychiatrists a broad discretion in assessing the relevance of data for the purposes of Social Council investigations, that fact does not preclude the existence of a patient's right to non-disclosure. The limits on the psychiatrist's discretion are set out in a much more precise and restricted manner than that in issue in the Masson and van Zon v. the Netherlands judgment of 28 September 1995, Series A no. 327-A, pp. 19\u201320, \u00a7 51, where the Court held that Article 6 was inapplicable.\nIn my opinion, these factors suffice to support a finding that it could be said, on arguable grounds, that a \u201cright\u201d to prevent the disclosure of information of that type was recognised in Swedish law.\n4. In the applicant's submission, the exception to the confidentiality obligation provided for by section 71 did not apply to information given to the Social Council by her psychiatrist. There was, therefore, a genuine and serious dispute as to the extent of her right to confidentiality.\n5. The right in issue, which related to the applicant's health and which therefore concerned her private life, must be considered as a civil right. Consequently, Article 6 had to apply.\n6. In addition to these considerations, regard being had to the fact that the application was registered by the Commission more than five years ago (on 22 May 1992), I consider that if there is doubt as to applicability \u2013 and I have doubts in the present case \u2013 the principle \u201cpro actione\u201d or \u201cpro-applicant\u201d must prevail.\n7. I therefore conclude that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable.\n8. As regards compliance with that provision, since the applicant had the possibility of applying to a court to protect her civil rights, I agree that there has been no violation. With respect to Article 13, having regard to my conclusion on Article 6, I agree with the Commission that no separate question arises. In any event, there has been no violation of Article 13 either.\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\n(Translation)\nIn the instant case there clearly was a dispute over a civil right.\nAs to the meaning to be given to those terms, I refer to my separate opinion in the Rolf Gustafson case.\nMrs Andersson asserted the right to confidentiality of medical data concerning her. That right is not only inherent in everybody's right to respect for his private life; it is also recognised in Swedish legislation.\nThe psychiatrist's decision to inform the Social Council of the applicant's health problems could, in itself, be regarded as justified in the circumstances of the case. But it should have been \u2013 or been able to be \u2013 submitted, before being implemented, to review by a court, a procedure which, it should be noted, ought to have been accomplishable very quickly.\nMrs Andersson was not able to secure any such review.\nIn this respect there was accordingly, in my view, a breach of Article 6 of the Convention in her regard and also of Article 8.\nBut the applicant did have available to her after the event judicial remedies which satisfied the requirements of Article 60 and therefore also, a fortiori, those of Article 13.", "001-60309": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DEVENNEY v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Devenney v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nMr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr V. Butkevych,\nMrs W. Thomassen,\nMr M. P. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 February 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. By virtue of Section 17 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act as amended, a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n18. Section 42 of the 1976 Act provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub\u2011section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the issue of the section 42 certificate deprived him of access to the tribunal to which he was entitled. In consequence of this alleged denial of access to a tribunal or court, the applicant claimed a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n20. The Court notes that the 1976 Act guaranteed persons a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to their employment, inter alia, by dismissing them or subjecting them to any other detriment. The Fair Employment Tribunal is empowered to assess individuals\u2019 financial loss if they are so discriminated against and award compensation when appropriate. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s pecuniary rights were affected by being denied access to the Fair Employment Tribunal.\n21. The operation of section 42(1), which states that the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order, does not define the scope of the substantive right in limine but provides a respondent with a defence to a complaint of unlawful discrimination (cf. the Powell and Rayner v the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36). Accordingly the Court considers that the applicant has a clearly defined statutory right which, having regard to the context in which it applied and its pecuniary nature, can be classified as a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court refers to its reasoning in its judgment of 10 July 1998 in the case of Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others and McElduff and Others v the United Kingdom (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, p. 1643).\n22. Accordingly the Court concludes that the present case concerns the applicant\u2019s civil rights and that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable.\n#### B. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n23. The Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied, do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way, or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see among other authorities, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p.1502, \u00a7 50).\n24. It is against this background of principles that the Court must consider the present case.\n25. The Court notes that the fact that the certificate issued by the Secretary of State constituted under section 42 of the 1976 Act conclusive proof that the dismissal of the applicant was carried out for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order meant that there could be no independent scrutiny whatsoever either as to the basis for the issue of such a certificate or as to whether the applicant was justified in his claim that he was dismissed on grounds of religious or political belief. In its decision of 5 January 1995, the Fair Employment Tribunal found that due to the existence of the section 42 certificate the Fair Employment Act did not apply to the termination of the applicant\u2019s employment and that accordingly there was nothing remaining for it to consider.\n26. The Court accepts that the protection of national security is a legitimate aim which may entail limitations on the right of access to a court, including withholding information for the purposes of security. As in the Tinnelly case therefore, it is necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the concerns for the protection of national security invoked by the authorities and the impact which the means they employed to this end had on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court or tribunal.\n27. The Court is mindful of security considerations regarding employees in public buildings, such as hotels, in the centre of town, particularly if frequented by military or police personnel. As against this, the dismissal had an immediate and dramatic effect upon the applicant, removing his means of livelihood. Further, the operation of section 42 meant that he was unable to challenge the dismissal or pursue any potential claim for pecuniary loss. He was not informed of the basis upon which the certificate was issued, has never been shown, and is not entitled to demand, sight of any information, which may have been placed before the Secretary of State which led to the certificate being issued. The applicant does not know whether any such information is correct or incorrect, complete or incomplete and whether it is reliable or not. Nor does he know whether the information provided could reasonably support the view expressed in the certificate.\n28. The Court observes moreover that the Government have failed to identify any new elements which could lead it to depart from its conclusion in the Tinnelly case that the severity of the restriction imposed by the conclusive section 42 certificate, which was tantamount to removal of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction by executive ipse dixit, was not mitigated by other available mechanisms of complaint, and that the situation in Northern Ireland did not exclude the introduction of special judicial procedures more apt to provide the individual with procedural justice. It noted that \u201cthe introduction of a procedure, regardless of the framework used, which would allow an adjudicator or tribunal fully satisfying the Article 6 \u00a7 1 requirements of independence and impartiality to examine in complete cognisance of all relevant evidence, documentary or other, the merits of the submissions of both sides, may indeed serve to enhance public confidence\u201d (Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others and McElduff and Others judgment cited above, p. 1663, \u00a7 78).\n29. For these reasons, the Court finds in the present case that the issue by the Secretary of State of a section 42 certificate constituted a disproportionate restriction on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court. There has, accordingly, been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION in conjunction with article 14 and of ARticle 13\n30. The applicant complains of discrimination under Article 14. He alleges that his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 have been subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion, political opinion or association with a national minority. He further complains that in breach of Article 13, he has not had any effective remedy before a national authority in respect of his alleged violations of his rights and freedoms.\n31. Article 14 provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 13 provides:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n32. The Court considers that it is not necessary to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 14 in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, having regard to its conclusion that the facts of the case disclose a breach of the latter provision. Likewise the Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether there has been a breach of Article 13, the requirements of which are less strict than those of Article 6 (see mutatis mutandis the Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, pp. 31\u201132, \u00a7\u00a7 83-84).\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n33. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damages\n34. The applicant claims compensation of two or three years of employment for pecuniary damage, namely, about 20,000 to 30,000 pounds sterling (GBP). Relying on a medical report which refers to problems of clinical depression contributed to by his lack of employment, he claims a sum of GBP 5,000.\n35. The Government consider that these claims are excessive and refer to the sums awarded in similar cases.\n36. The Court cannot speculate as to what would have been the outcome of the proceedings brought by the applicant under the 1976 Act had the section 42 certificate not been issued. However the Court nevertheless considers that the applicant was denied the opportunity to obtain a ruling on the merits of his claim that he was the victim of unlawful discrimination. Having regard to previous cases (see, most recently, Devlin v. the United Kingdom, no. 29545/95 [Section 3], judgment of 30 October 2001, \u00a7\u00a7 38\u201139) and, deciding on an equitable basis, it awards the applicant the sum of GBP 10,000.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n37. The applicant claims GBP 3,550 for solicitors\u2019 fees (25 hours at GBP 142 per hour) and GBP 165 for the medical report supporting his claims.\n38. The Government consider that a lesser sum is more appropriate.\n39. The Court recalls that this application raised issues which were, to a large extent, identical to those considered in the Tinnelly and Devlin cases (cited above). Nor was this a case in which the Court requested assistance from the parties at any oral hearing or in which lengthy written submissions were submitted. Making an assessment on an equitable basis and taking into account the amount of legal aid awarded by the Council of Europe, it awards the sum of GBP 2,500, plus any value-added tax which may be chargeable.\n#### C. Default interest\n40. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that it is not necessary to examine further the complaints made under Articles 13 or 14 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts:\n(i) GBP 10,000 (ten thousand pounds sterling) in respect of loss of opportunity ;\n(ii) GBP 2,500 (two thousand five hundred pounds sterling) in respect of costs and expenses, plus any value-added tax which may be chargeable;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 7.5% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and notified in writing on 19 March 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Lilja v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nMr I. Cabral Barreto,\nMr R. T\u00fcrmen,\nMrs A. Mularoni,\nMrs E. Fura-Sandstr\u00f6m,\nMr D. Popovi\u0107, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 4 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government left it to the Court to decide whether the relevant proceedings had been concluded within a reasonable time.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration in respect of the criminal proceedings began on 21 October 1996 and ended on 19 March 2004. It thus lasted seven years and five months for one level of jurisdiction. The corresponding period concerning the tax proceedings began on 5 December 1997 and ended on 2 October 2003 and thus lasted five years and ten months for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government questioned whether the applicant could be considered a victim in so far as his complaint concerned the tax proceedings. They referred to the fact that the relevant taxes, contributions and surcharges had been levied not on the applicant himself but on his company and that, similarly, the company had been the party to the proceedings.\n22. The Government further submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not sued the Swedish State for damages on account of the length of the proceedings. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen), pronounced on 9 June 2005, where a plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, the applicant could have tried this avenue before complaining to the Court or, in any event, should now do so.\n23. The Court first observes that the company Latem AB was wholly owned by the applicant and that the criminal and tax proceedings were related, as they were both based on the submission of incorrect tax declarations. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant may claim to be a victim of the length of the tax proceedings and that, in the examination of his complaint, the two sets of proceedings are to be considered together. In this connection, it reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1, under its criminal head, is applicable to the tax proceedings, in so far as they concerned tax surcharges (see, among other authorities, Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2002-VII).\nThe Court further notes that the judgment of the Supreme Court referred to by the Government was pronounced on 9 June 2005, i.e. almost three years after the applicant lodged the present application with the Court and about one year and three months after his acquittal by the District Court acquired legal force. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant cannot now be required to lodge a compensation claim before the national courts, nor could he have been expected to have done so in March 2004 since, at that time, there were no indications that it would have been an effective remedy. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant, during the proceedings before the District Court, did complain to the Chancellor of Justice that the proceedings were taking too long.\n24. The Government\u2019s objections must accordingly be dismissed. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n25. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n26. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above).\n27. The Government claimed that both the criminal and the tax proceedings had concerned matters of some complexity and had involved extensive investigations regarding many different suspects and companies. In regard to the criminal case, they emphasised that the applicant had on most occasions consented to the prosecutor\u2019s requests for extensions of the time-limits for bringing an indictment. As far as the tax case was concerned, they pointed out that the applicant had made several requests for extensions of time-limits, which had been granted by the courts.\n28. While the Court acknowledges that the two related sets of proceedings at issue were of a complex nature, both as regards the subject matter and the number of suspects and companies involved, it notes that the Director General of the National Economic Crimes Bureau, in his decision of 22 November 2002, found that there had been no reason for the public prosecutor in the criminal case to await the outcome of the tax proceedings and that it had been unacceptable for the applicant to have to wait more than four years from the completion of the preliminary investigation to the bringing of the indictment. The Court fully agrees with that opinion; whether or not the applicant consented to many of the prosecutor\u2019s requests for extensions of time-limits, it was for the District Court to ensure that the case proceeded with appropriate speed. Having regard to the aforementioned four-year period as well as the total length of more than seven years, involving only one judicial instance, it is clear that the criminal proceedings were not conducted with the promptness required by Article 6 \u00a7 1. In regard to the tax proceedings, the Court notes that the appeal of the applicant\u2019s company against the County Administrative Court\u2019s judgment was pending before the Administrative Court of Appeal for more than three years. This period must also be considered unreasonable.\n29. Thus, in the light of the criteria laid down in its case-law and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the overall length of the proceedings at issue in the present case was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n30. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n31. The applicant claimed 15,500 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and a total of SEK 10,819,934 (approximately EUR 1,200,000) in respect of pecuniary damage.\n32. The Government considered that compensation for non-pecuniary damage should not exceed EUR 9,000. They contested the claim for pecuniary damage.\n33. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it considers that the applicant must have sustained some non-pecuniary damage because of the excessive length of the domestic proceedings. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards him EUR 10,000 under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n34. The applicant also claimed more than SEK 850,000 for costs and expenses, of which he specified that SEK 183,933 (approximately EUR 20,000) had been incurred before the Court.\n35. The Government contested the claim in so far as it concerned the domestic proceedings.\n36. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 2,000 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n37. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Swedish kronor at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 10,000 (ten thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 2,000 (two thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 23 January 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

Industrial injury insurance\n25. All gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against industrial injuries in accordance with the 1976 Act. Anyone who is put on the sick-list as a result of an industrial injury and who is insured under the 1962 Act is entitled to the same per diem benefit from the ordinary sickness insurance (social insurance) during the first 90 days as if he or she had been sick for a reason other than an industrial injury. When 90 days have passed, the insured person is entitled to a per diem sickness benefit in accordance with the 1976 Act (industrial injury insurance), if his or her ability to carry on with gainful employment is reduced by at least 25% (50% prior to 1 July 1990). After the period of sickness has come to an end and the insured person is no longer on the sick-list, he or she is entitled to a life annuity if the capacity for gainful employment is reduced by at least one fifteenth.\n#### B. Social insurance\n26. All Swedish nationals and other residents in Sweden are insured in accordance with the 1962 Act. Anyone who is registered with the Social Insurance Office and has an annual income of at least 6,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) has the right to a per diem sickness benefit, if his or her sickness reduces the ability to work by at least 25%.\n#### C. Procedure\n27. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 and 1976 Acts may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and, at the relevant time, subject to leave to appeal being granted, to the Supreme Social Insurance Court. The latter court was the final instance in social insurance matters until 1 July 1995, when it was abolished and its tasks taken over by the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten).\n28. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. It also regulated the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances was not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court.\n29. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n30. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n31. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the courts had constituted a violation of her rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n32. The Government questioned whether it had not been justified to dispense with oral hearings in the applicant\u2019s cases. They contended that such hearings would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case files and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they pointed out that the applicant had not invoked any oral evidence and that the judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s capacity to work by meeting her in person but had had to rely on written medical evidence. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing her cases in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under certain social-insurance schemes, no questions of public interest had been involved. In any event, considering the issues involved and the personal nature of the cases, an oral hearing would have been held in camera.\n33. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold oral hearings and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold oral hearings, she had, at least tacitly, waived her right to have her cases heard in public before that judicial instance. In addition, some of the applicant\u2019s requests for oral hearings had been made without stating any reasons.\n##### 2. The applicant\n34. The applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. She claimed that an oral hearing had been indispensable in her cases, as the investigation made by the Office had been inadequate and had led to erroneous assessments and the information available to the courts thus had been insufficient. It is true that she did not propose that any witnesses or experts be heard. However, an oral hearing would have given her the opportunity to describe her medical problems and resulting difficulties in resuming her work. Also, she would have been able to show, for example, how much her income had decreased due to her industrial injury.\n35. The applicant further claimed that, due to the Office\u2019s insufficient investigation, the courts had been obliged to hold hearings of their own motion in order to acquire sufficient information on which to base their decisions. Accordingly, the lack of a specific request for a hearing in the County Administrative Court had been of no relevance. Referring to the conditions for a hearing as set out in section 9 of the 1971 Act, the applicant also stated that, although she had not given reasons for all her requests for hearings, they had obviously been made in order to further the investigation in the case.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n36. Noting that the Government have not disputed the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to the case at hand, the Court observes that the proceedings at issue concerned the applicant\u2019s claim to benefits under social-security schemes. The purpose of the proceedings was to obtain decisions in disputes over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, and they accordingly fall within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53).\n##### 2. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1\n37. The Court first finds that the entitlement to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 necessarily implies a right to an \u201coral hearing\u201d. However, the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be done explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\nFurthermore, a hearing may not be necessary due to exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201111, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; and Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 44).\n38. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant did not request a hearing before the County Administrative Court in either of her cases. As Section 9 of the 1971 Act provided that the proceedings before the administrative courts were normally in writing, the applicant could have been expected to request a hearing before that court if she attached importance to it. She did not do so, however, and the Court therefore finds that she can reasonably be considered to have waived her right to a hearing before the County Administrative Court.\nMoreover, the Supreme Social Insurance Court only determined whether or not leave to appeal should be granted and, as a consequence of its refusal to grant leave, did not make a full examination of the applicant\u2019s case. Even assuming that Article 6 \u00a7 1 applies to the determination of this question, the Court finds that it could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the written submissions and that, accordingly, the absence of an oral hearing before the Supreme Social Insurance Court was justified.\n39. It remains to be determined whether the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal involved a breach of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1. In this connection, the Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance there is normally a right to a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment cited above, p. 20, \u00a7 64). However, the absence of a hearing before a second or third instance may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue, provided a hearing has been held at first instance (see, for instance, Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36). Accordingly, unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 \u00a7 1 implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one instance.\n40. The Court notes that no hearing was held at first instance since the applicant did not request the County Administrative Court to hold one. It acknowledges that, in the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing is held already at first instance rather than only before the appellate court. Depending on the circumstances of the case, it might therefore be acceptable to reject a request for a hearing upon appeal, although no such hearing has been held at first instance.\n41. The Court further recognises that disputes concerning benefits under social-security schemes are generally rather technical and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\n42. In the applicant\u2019s cases, the Court observes that the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court of Appeal was not limited to matters of law but also extended to factual issues. The issue in both cases was whether the applicant\u2019s ability to work was reduced in a way which would have made her entitled to benefits under the 1962 and 1976 Acts. The Court observes, however, that the courts\u2019 assessments were entirely based on the medical evidence in the cases, presented in the form of written opinions issued by different physicians. It does not appear that the physicians\u2019 opinions differed. Also the applicant referred to this written evidence; in her appeal against the Office\u2019s decision of 20 November 1991, she contended that the medical opinions in fact showed that she was entitled to the benefits sought.\n43. In these circumstances, it must be concluded that the dispute in the cases, as presented by the applicant to the Administrative Court of Appeal, concerned the correct interpretation of written medical evidence. The Court considers that the appellate court could adequately resolve this issue on the basis of the medical certificates in question and the applicant\u2019s written submissions. It notes, in this connection, that the applicant, in the decisions rejecting her requests for oral hearings, was invited by the appellate court to submit final observations in writing.\n44. The Court further takes into account that the applicant did not request the Administrative Court of Appeal to call any witnesses and did not rely on any other oral evidence. In fact, she did not state any reasons for her requests that the appellate court hold hearings in the cases.\n45. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court finds that there were exceptional circumstances which justified dispensing with a hearing in the applicant\u2019s cases.\nThere has accordingly been no breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 12 November 2002, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Nicolas Bratza\nRegistrar President\nN.B.\nM.O\u2019B.", "001-75894": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ELAHI v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Elahi v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J. Casadevall, President,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr L. Garlicki,\nMs L. Mijovi\u0107,\nMr J. \u0160ikuta, judges,\nand Mr T.L. Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 May 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. See the Court\u2019s judgment in Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 5394/97, ECHR 2000\u2011V, and also Taylor-Sabori v. the United Kingdom, no. 47114/99, 22 October 2002, and Hewitson v. the United Kingdom, no. 50015/99, 27 May 2003.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that he had been deprived of a fair trial. Article 6, in so far as it is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing...\u201d\nThe applicant alleged that his trial had been rendered unfair by the use of the covert recording device and also by the acts of participating informants. The applicant claimed that, after his trial and conviction, but before the appeal proceedings, an informant made a statement to his solicitor which indicated that the recording device was installed as a result of information given to the police and that the police encouraged the informant to channel his conversations with the applicant in such a way as to elicit incriminating admissions.\n14. The Government made no submissions under Article 6.\n15. The Court considers that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaint about the involvement of a participating informant in the investigation and it notes that that the Court of Appeal found no evidence to support the allegation of entrapment. In the Khan judgment it found that the use at the applicant\u2019s trial of secretly taped material did not conflict with the requirements of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and it finds the present case indistinguishable on this point.\n16. It follows that the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is manifestly ill-founded and inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained under Article 8 about the use of participating informants, and also about the use of covert listening devices to obtain material which was subsequently relied on by the prosecution. Article 8, in so far as it is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private...life...and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n18. The Government accepted that there had been a violation of Article 8 in so far as the Home Office Guidelines at the relevant time were not legally binding or publicly accessible.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court observes that the complaint relating to participating informants is inadmissible for the same reasons as the linked complaint under Article 6. The remainder of the complaint under Article 8, concerning the use of a covert listening device, is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention or inadmissible on any other ground. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n20. In light of the Government\u2019s admission and in accordance with its judgments in Khan, Taylor-Sabori and Hewitson (see paragraph 12 above), the Court finds that there has been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention in that the tape recordings from the covert listening equipment used in evidence against the applicant were not obtained \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n22. The applicant asked for compensation, without claiming any specific amount.\n23. The Government submitted that it was a relatively straightforward case, raising issues virtually identical to those in a series of previous judgments, where the Court had not made any award of damages.\n24. The Court sees no reason for distinguishing the present case from those cited in paragraph 12 above, and accordingly holds that the finding of a violation is in itself sufficient just satisfaction.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n25. The applicant also claimed GBP 128,745.27 (including value added tax, \u201cVAT\u201d) in respect of domestic costs and expenses incurred defending the criminal charges against him, and a further GBP 2702.50, including VAT, for the costs of bringing the application to Strasbourg.\n26. The Government noted that in the more recent cases about covert surveillance (for example, Hewitson) the Court had made only a modest award of costs, in recognition of the fact that the case was very straightforward, and raised virtually identical issues to previous cases. In the current case, the Government were of the view that the legal costs and expenses claimed were excessively high in the light of the lack of complexity of the case, and the early stage of proceedings reached, and given the awards in similar cases. In the circumstances they suggested that a reasonable sum in respect of costs and expenses would be GBP 4,000.\n27. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred, for the purpose of preventing or obtaining redress for the matter found to constitute a violation of the Convention, and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 6,000, covering costs under all heads, together with any tax that may be payable.\n#### C. Default interest\n28. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the complaint under Article 8 concerning the use of covert listening devices admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n###### (a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 6,000 (six thousand euros) to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, in respect of costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n###### (b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n##### 4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 June 2006, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

Berro-Lef\u00e8vre, judges,\nand Mr S. Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 May 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the length of her detention both in police custody and on remand exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Government maintained under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the application must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or, alternatively, for failure to comply with the six-month rule. Under the first limb of their objections, the Government pointed out that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending. As regards the second limb of their objections, the Government argued, firstly, that the applicant should have lodged her complaint regarding the length of her detention in police custody within six months following the date on which she was remanded in custody, i.e. on 1 October 1993. Secondly, they suggested that the applicant should have lodged her complaint pertaining to the length of her remand in custody within six months following the date on which the District Court ruled on the applicant's request for release, i.e. on 20 November 2000.\n20. The applicant disputed the Government's arguments.\n21. As regards the complaint concerning the length of the applicant's remand in custody, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government's similar objections regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies in previous cases (see, in particular, Tutar v. Turkey, no. 11798/03, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14, 10 October 2006). It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned applications. In so far as the Government suggest that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months rule, the Court recalls that if an applicant submits her complaints to the Court while she is still in detention, the case cannot be dismissed as being out of time (see, in particular, Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IX). In the instant case, the applicant was still in detention when she lodged her complaint before this Court. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government's objections under this head.\n22. Moreover, the Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n23. As to the complaint relating to the length of the applicant's detention in police custody, the Court reiterates that, according to the established case-law of the Convention organs, where there is no domestic remedy available, the six\u2011month period runs from the date of the act alleged to constitute a violation of the Convention; however, where it concerns a continuing situation, the period of six months runs from the end of the situation concerned (see, among other authorities, Ege v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47117/99, 10 February 2004).\n24. The Court notes that the applicant's detention in police custody ended when she was detained on remand on 1 October 1993, whereas this complaint was lodged with the Court on 12 November 2002, i.e. more than six months later. In these circumstances, the Court accepts the Government's objection that the applicant has failed to comply with the six\u2011month rule. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Merits\n25. The Government contended that the domestic authorities displayed diligence when considering the applicant's requests for release pending trial. Moreover, they claimed that the seriousness of the crime and the special circumstances of the case justified her continued detention on remand.\n26. The applicant maintained her allegations.\n27. The Court reiterates that it falls in the first place to the domestic judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the detention of an accused person pending trial does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is primarily on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the established facts mentioned by the applicants in their appeals, that the Court must determine whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Sevgin and \u0130nce v. Turkey, no. 46262/99, \u00a7 61, 20 September 2005).\n28. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a sine qua non for the validity of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices; the Court must then establish whether the other grounds cited by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty (see, among other authorities, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7 77, 26 July 2001, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 152-153, ECHR 2000-IV).\n29. In the instant case, the Court notes that there were two periods of pre-trial detention. The first period began on 17 September 1993 with the applicant's arrest and ended on 17 December 2003, the date of the judgment of the \u0130stanbul Assize Court. From that point on, and until the Court of Cassation's decision of 1 April 2005, the applicant was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, which falls within the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention. The second period began on 1 April 2005 and ended on 21 December 2005 when the applicant was released pending trial. It has therefore lasted around eleven years in total (see, in particular, Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, \u00a7\u00a7 23-36, 16 January 2007). During this time, the first-instance court considered the applicant's continued detention at the end of each hearing, either on its own motion or upon the request of the applicant. It notes however, from the material in the case file, that the court ordered the applicant's continued detention on remand using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence and the state of evidence\u201d.\n30. The Court takes note of the seriousness of the offence attributed to the applicant and the severity of the relevant punishment. However, it reiterates that the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000-XI). In this connection, the Court further reiterates that the Convention case-law has developed four basic acceptable reasons for refusing bail: the risk that the accused will fail to appear for trial; the risk that the accused, if released, would take action to prejudice the administration of justice or commit further offences or cause public disorder (see, in particular, Smirnova v. Russia, nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2003\u2011IX (extracts)). In the instant case, the Court notes the lack of such reasoning in the domestic court's decisions to prolong the applicant's remand in custody. There is also no evidence that the authorities took into account the time which had elapsed as a criterion in the applicant's favour.\n31. Finally, although, in general, the expression \u201cthe state of the evidence\u201d may be a relevant factor for the existence and persistence of serious indications of guilt, in the present case it nevertheless, alone, cannot justify the length of the detention of which the applicant complains (see Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, \u00a7 43, Tomasi v. France, judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A, and Mansur v. Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-B, \u00a7 55).\n32. The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the grounds given for the applicant's remand in detention were not \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d to justify holding her in custody for almost eleven years.\n33. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n34. In her observations dated 19 January 2006 the applicant referred to the fact that she had been subjected to ill-treatment during her stay in police custody in breach of Article 3 of the Convention.\n35. The Court notes that the applicant failed to elaborate her complaint under this head and to submit supporting documents. Therefore, this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n37. The applicant claimed 65,000 new Turkish liras (YTL) (approximately 40,236 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary and YTL 40,000 (approximately EUR 24,760) for non-pecuniary damage. In respect of pecuniary damage, the applicant referred to the excessive length of the criminal proceedings and the time she had spent in detention pending trial, as a result of which she had not been able to work.\n38. The Government contested the amounts.\n39. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violations found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, it accepts that the applicant must have suffered some non\u2011pecuniary damage which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation alone. Taking into account the circumstances of the case and having regard to its case-law, the Court awards the applicant EUR 9,000 for non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n40. The applicant also claimed, in total, YTL 45,500 (approximately EUR 28,165) for costs and expenses incurred both before the domestic proceedings and before the Court. This sum included the travelling expenses incurred by the applicant's family and legal representatives. In support of her claims, the applicant submitted a schedule of costs prepared by her representatives and the \u0130stanbul Bar Association's recommended fees list for 2005. However, she did not submit any other relevant documents.\n41. The Government contested the amount.\n42. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n43. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the length of the applicant's detention on remand admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following sums, to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(i) EUR 9,000 (nine thousand euros) for non-pecuniary damage,\n(ii) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) for costs and expenses,\n(iii) plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount[s] at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 14 June 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nSantiago Quesada Bo\u0161tjan M.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the \u00c7obano\u011flu and Budak judgment v. Turkey, (no. 45977/99, \u00a7\u00a7 29\u201130, 30 January 2007).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n16. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In this regard, the Government maintained that the applicants failed to object to their continued remand in detention pursuant to Article 298 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). They further submitted that the applicants failed to raise the substance of the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts.\n17. The applicants did not specifically deal with the Government's objections under this head.\n18. As regards the first limb of the Government's objection, the Court reiterates that under the terms of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it can only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law. However, only available and adequate remedies must be tried under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among others, Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v. Turkey, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 64, 27 June 2006).\n19. The Court recalls that, in the area of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the burden of proof is on the Government claiming non\u2011exhaustion to indicate to the Court with sufficient clarity the remedy to which the applicants have not had recourse and to satisfy the Court that this remedy was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants' complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan, cited above, \u00a7 65). Furthermore, the Court notes that the application of the rule of exhaustion must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to establish. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Acunbay v. Turkey, nos. 61442/00 and 61445/00, \u00a7 45, 31 May 2005).\n20. In the instant case the Court notes that the trial court examined the applicants' detention on remand at the end of each hearing, either of its own motion or upon the request of the applicants. It therefore had the opportunity to end the applicants' alleged lengthy detention and to avoid or to redress an alleged breach of the Convention (see Acunbay, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Tamer and Others v. Turkey, no. 235/02, \u00a7 28, 22 June 2006).\n21. The Court further notes that, pursuant to Article 298 of the CCP (since repealed), the applicants could have objected to their continued remand in custody as indicated by the Government. However, the Court cannot agree with the Government that this remedy was effective and offered reasonable prospects of success in practice for the following reasons.\n22. The Court has examined several cases against Turkey in which it has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention based on the fact that, inter alia, the State Security Courts used the same formal reasons for the applicants' continued detention without explaining their specific relevance in each case (see, for example, Hasan Ceylan v. Turkey, no. 58398/00, 23 May 2006, Pakkan v. Turkey, no. 13017/02, 31 October 2006, G\u0131yasettin Altun v. Turkey, no. 73038/01, 24 May 2005, Tutar v. Turkey, no. 11798/03, 10 October 2006, Mehmet G\u00fcne\u015f v. Turkey, no. 61908/00, 21 September 2006, Acunbay, cited above, and Tamer and Others, cited above). It considers that, in these circumstances, an objection against such stereotype reasoning would have had little prospect of success before another instance. Moreover, as a rule, the objection proceedings in question are not adversarial and are decided in the absence of an oral hearing (Article 302 \u00a7 1 of the CCP). They therefore lack the guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see, for example, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II, and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VIII, p. 3302, \u00a7 162).\n23. The Court notes that there is a distinction between the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 and the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention aimed at providing safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, where its consistent case-law shows that such safeguards fail or are deficient, it would be contrary to the very principle of the Convention and would lead to excessive formalism under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to demand of the applicant the pursuit of inadequate safeguards.\n24. Furthermore, the Court notes that the Government's submissions in the instant case remain very general, only citing the relevant provisions in the law. The Court reiterates that it is not for the Convention bodies to cure of their own motion any shortcomings or lack of precision in the respondent Government's arguments (see, in particular, Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-B, p. 77, \u00a7 35). In the light of the above, the Court rejects the Government's objection under this head.\n25. As to whether the applicants had failed to complain about the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government's preliminary objections in similar cases (see, in particular, Mete v. Turkey, no. 39327/02, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, 25 October 2005). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above\u2011mentioned application. It therefore also rejects this aspect of the Government's objection.\n26. The Court considers that the application raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. It concludes therefore that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicants complained that their remand in custody exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement as provided in Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads insofar as relevant as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n28. The Government maintained that the applicants' detention was based on the existence of reasonable grounds of suspicion of them having committed an offence, and that the custodial measure had been reviewed periodically by the competent authority, with special diligence, in accordance with the requirements laid down by the applicable law at the relevant time. They pointed out that the offence with which the applicants were charged was of a serious nature, and that their continued remand in custody was necessary to prevent crime and to preserve public order.\n29. The applicants maintained their allegations.\n30. The Court notes from the material in the case file that the State Security Court considered the applicants' detention on remand at the end of each hearing, either on its own motion or upon the request of the applicants. On each occasion it prolonged that detention using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the content of the file\u201d. Although, in general, the expression \u201cthe state of evidence\u201d may be a relevant factor for the existence and persistence of serious indications of guilt, in the present case it nevertheless, alone, cannot justify a length of preventive detention of over two years and three months, in particular, having regard to the young age of the applicants (see, in particular, Sel\u00e7uk v. Turkey, no. 21768/02, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36, 10 January 2006, Letellier v. France, judgment of 26 June 1991, Series A no. 207, Tomasi v. France, judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A, Mansur v. Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-B, \u00a7 55).\n31. Consequently there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicants complained that the length of the criminal proceedings exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ...any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a.hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ...tribunal...\u201d\n33. The Government maintained that, in the circumstances of the present case, the length of the criminal proceedings could not be considered unreasonably long.\n34. The applicants maintained their allegations.\n35. The Court observes that the period to be taken into consideration began on 19 February 1999, when the applicants were arrested and taken into custody and ended on 20 September 2001, when the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first instance court. The period under consideration thus lasted two years and seven months before two instances.\n36. After examining the overall duration of the proceedings, and taking into account that the case was of some complexity, the number of accused and the fact that the case was dealt with at two levels of jurisdiction, the Court does not consider that the length of the proceedings in the present case was excessive even if it had been somewhat prolonged by the decision of the first instance court to adjourn a number of hearings pending the establishment of the ages of some of the accused. In this connection the Court reiterates that while Article 6 \u00a7 1 requires that judicial proceedings be conducted expeditiously, it also lays emphasis on the more general principle of the proper administration of justice (see, for example, Gast and Popp v. Germany, no. 29357/95, p. 487, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000-II). The Court further observes that no significant delay resulted at the appeal stage.\n37. Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court finds that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was complied with in the present case. Consequently, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 as regards the length of the proceedings.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n39. The applicants claimed, in total, 60,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n40. The Government contested the amounts.\n41. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. On the other hand, it awards each applicant EUR 3,000 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n42. The applicants also claimed, in total, EUR 16,802 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court.\n43. The Government contested the amounts.\n44. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court rejects the claim for costs and expenses in the domestic proceedings and considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000, jointly, for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n45. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) each in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) jointly, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 3 May 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 June and 1 September 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. Legal aid\n18. Legal aid is available to litigants in the English courts subject to various requirements as to means and the merits of the case in question. Financial assessments of a litigant\u2019s disposable income and capital are carried out by specialist staff of the Benefits Agency\u2019s Legal Aid Assessment Office. The resources of the litigant\u2019s spouse are treated as belonging to the litigant unless they are living \u201cseparate and apart\u201d (see the Civil Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989 no. 338), Regulations 4 and 7).\n#### B. Assessment of costs against a legally aided litigant\n19. In the English courts, the award of costs generally (in all cases, including those where one or more parties are legally aided) is a matter for the discretion of the court (see the Supreme Court Act 1981, section 51). However, rules of court lay down certain principles which are normally applied in the exercise of this discretion, including the principle that the\nunsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party (see the Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 62, Rule 3, and the County Court Rules, Order 38, Rule 1 (3)).\n20. This principle is not affected by the fact that an unsuccessful litigant is legally aided. However, after an order for costs has been made against such a person, the court which tried or heard the proceedings must determine how much of these costs it would be reasonable for the legally aided litigant to pay, in accordance with section 17 (1) of the Legal Aid Act 1988, which provides:\n\u201cThe liability of a legally assisted party under an order for costs made against him with respect to any proceedings shall not exceed the amount (if any) which is a reasonable one for him to pay having regard to all the circumstances, including the financial resources of all the parties and their conduct in connection with the dispute.\u201d\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n21. In their application to the Commission of 14 March 1993 (no. 22410/93) Mr and Mrs Robins made a number of complaints under Articles 6, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention concerning the substantive proceedings relating to their dispute with their neighbours; in addition, they complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the costs proceedings.\n22. On 22 February 1995, the Commission declared inadmissible the complaints concerning the substantive proceedings. The complaint concerning the costs proceedings was declared admissible on 18 January 1996. In its report of 4 July 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion, by sixteen votes to nine, that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because the proceedings did not fall within the scope of that provision. The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n23. The Government in their memorial asked the Court to find that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not applicable to the proceedings in question or, in the alternative, that there had been no violation of that provision.\nThe applicants asked the Court to find a violation and to award them compensation under Article 50 of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicants contended that the costs proceedings were not concluded within a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a \u2026 hearing within a reasonable time by [a] \u2026 tribunal ...\u201d\nThe Government and the Commission were both of the opinion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable.\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n25. The applicants disputed that Judge Clarke had made an order for costs on 1 May 1991; in their view the proceedings were therefore both for the determination of their basic liability to pay costs and the assessment of the amount of their contribution. They submitted that these proceedings fell within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because they could not be divorced from the substantive proceedings, which undoubtedly involved \u201cthe determination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d. Furthermore, they reminded the Court that the sums of money at stake were substantial and that they were finally ordered to pay a contribution in excess of 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP).\n26. The Government contended that Judge Clarke had ordered that the applicants pay Mr and Mrs T.\u2019s costs on 1 May 1991. The proceedings in question did not, therefore, concern a determination of the substantive rights of the parties to the litigation or of the liability of Mr and Mrs Robins to pay their neighbours\u2019 costs; they were instead concerned with an investigation by the court under section 17 of the 1988 Act into the applicants\u2019 financial circumstances and the assessment of any contribution which it was reasonable for them to pay (see paragraph 20 above). This investigation fell within the scope of public law and did not concern \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n27. The Commission in its report found that the costs proceedings were not in any way linked to the substantive dispute between the applicants and their neighbours, since the dispute over costs arose after the substantive dispute had been resolved and had no relevance to it. It invoked its case-law to the effect that subsidiary proceedings to decide costs fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n28. The Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires that all stages of legal proceedings for the \u201cdetermination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d, not excluding stages subsequent to judgment on the merits, be resolved within a reasonable time (see the Silva Pontes v. Portugal judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 286-A, p. 14, \u00a7\u00a7 33\u201336; the Di Pede v. Italy and Zappia v. Italy judgments of 26 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1384 and 1411\u201312, \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 20, respectively; and, mutatis mutandis, the Hornsby v. Greece judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 510\u201311, \u00a7 40).\n29. The Court observes that the legal costs which formed the subject matter of the proceedings in question were incurred during the resolution of a dispute between neighbours which undoubtedly involved \u201cthe determination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d (see paragraph 8 above). It notes that there was some disagreement between the Government and the applicants as to whether Judge Clarke had ordered on 1 May 1991 that Mr and Mrs T., the successful parties to the litigation, should have their costs paid by the applicants. However, whether the proceedings in question were for the determination of the applicants\u2019 liability to pay their neighbours\u2019 costs or were limited to an investigation under section 17 of the 1988 Act into the applicants\u2019 financial circumstances and the size of the contribution it was reasonable for them to pay, the Court considers that the costs proceedings, even though separately decided, must be seen as a continuation of the substantive litigation and accordingly as part of a \u201cdetermination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d (see, mutatis mutandis, the authorities cited in the preceding paragraph).\nIt follows that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable.\n#### B. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n30. The applicants, Government and Commission all agreed that the relevant period began on 1 May 1991 when Judge Clarke determined the substantive dispute (see paragraph 8 above) and ended on 19 June 1995, with the Court of Appeal\u2019s dismissal of the applicants\u2019 appeal against the judgment on costs (see paragraph 17 above). The Court sees no reason for departing from this approach.\n##### 2. Reasonableness of the length of proceedings\n31. Mr and Mrs Robins pointed out that it had taken over four years to determine the costs issues. They complained, inter alia, about the delay between February and November 1992 caused by the Legal Aid Board\u2019s mistaken belief that they had separated (see paragraph 11 above) and the period between January 1993 and April 1994 when apparently no action was taken by the Civil Appeals Office to process the application (see paragraphs 13\u201315 above).\n32. The Government submitted that the State authorities could not be held responsible for the entire length of the proceedings. In particular, they stressed that the failure of the parties to the litigation to come to any agreement over the facts prolonged the dispute, as did Judge Clarke\u2019s ill-health and the applicants\u2019 decision to appeal against Judge Darwall-Smith\u2019s judgment (see paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 above).\n33. The Court recalls that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case, having regard in particular to the complexity of the case and the conduct of the parties to the dispute and the relevant authorities (see for example the Duclos v. France judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, pp. 2180\u201381, \u00a7 55).\n34. The Court notes that it took over four years to resolve what may be regarded as a relatively straightforward dispute over costs. It is undoubtedly true that the State authorities cannot be held responsible for the totality of the delays in the case. Nonetheless, as the Department of Social Security itself explained, ten months were wasted between February and November 1992 because of that Department\u2019s mistaken belief that the applicants had separated (see paragraph 11 above). Moreover, there was a period lasting approximately sixteen months, between the application for an extension of time for the filing of notice of appeal in January 1993 and the registrar\u2019s directions in April 1994, when it would seem that the court authorities were totally inactive (see paragraphs 13\u201315 above). Basing itself on these two periods, in the context of the overall length of the proceedings, the Court concludes that there was an unreasonable delay in dealing with the applicants\u2019 case.\n35. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in that the applicants\u2019 \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d were not determined within \u201ca reasonable time\u201d.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Mr and Mrs Robins claimed compensation under Article 50 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Pecuniary damage\n37. The applicants submitted that the delay in determining the costs proceedings gave rise to an atmosphere of suspicion and intrigue which prejudiced them and resulted in their liability to pay a contribution towards their neighbours\u2019 costs in excess of GBP 10,000 (see paragraphs 12 and 17 above.\n38. The Government did not accept that there should be any liability for compensation based on an alleged \u201catmosphere of suspicion and intrigue\u201d to the prejudice of the applicants in the County Court proceedings.\n39. There is no evidence which would permit the Court to assume that the costs issue would have been decided any differently had the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 not occurred. For this reason, it does not award any compensation in respect of the alleged pecuniary damage (see, mutatis mutandis, the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, p. 284, \u00a7 85).\n#### B. Non-pecuniary damage\n40. In addition, the applicants claimed compensation for the stress caused by the mistakes and delays of the administrative and judicial authorities and the time consumed by the proceedings before the domestic courts.\n41. The Court considers that in the circumstances of the case a finding of violation constitutes sufficient satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered.\n#### C. Costs and expenses\n42. The applicants claimed their personal costs and expenses arising from the Strasbourg proceedings: Mrs Robins had spent approximately forty days working on the case, for which she asked to be compensated at a level equivalent to that of a solicitor or barrister, and they had incurred travel and other expenses amounting to approximately GBP 320. In addition they claimed solicitors\u2019 costs of GBP 1,583.25 (exclusive of value-added tax \u2013 \u201cVAT\u201d) and counsel\u2019s fees of GBP 750 (exclusive of VAT).\n43. The Government informed the Court that they did not agree that it would be proper to compensate the applicants for the time spent preparing the case at the level sought, although they accepted the amounts claimed in respect of solicitors\u2019 costs and counsel\u2019s fees.\n44. The Court awards GBP 2,700, together with any VAT which may be chargeable, in respect of legal costs and expenses.\n#### D. Default interest\n45. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage alleged by the applicants;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months, in respect of costs and expenses, 2,700 (two thousand seven hundred) pounds sterling together with any value-added tax which may be chargeable;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and in French and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1997.\nSigned: Rudolf Bernhardt\nPresident\nSigned: Herbert Petzold\nRegistrar", "001-101231": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KURKAEV v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Domestic law and practice concerning asylum procedures\n13. A description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning asylum procedures may be found in the case of Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey (no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a7 29-44, 22 September 2009).\n#### B. Relevant CPT reports\n14. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2002)8 - Report concerning the CPT's visit to the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters (referred to as \u201cthe holding facility\u201d or \u201cdetention unit\u201d at \u201cIstanbul Police Headquarters\u201d) from 2-14 September 2001 are as follows:\n\u201c63. The holding facility at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was not overcrowded at the time of the visit (35 persons). Further, some limited renovation work (e.g. painting of walls) had been carried out shortly before the visit, and all the detainees had a bed and mattress. In addition, the ventilation system worked satisfactorily and the cell doors were unlocked, thereby enabling detainees to have ready access to the facilities in the corridor (e.g. drink dispenser, telephone, etc.) as well as to the sanitary facilities. However, in the same way as during the 1999 visit, it would appear that this relatively favourable state of affairs was atypical.\nConsultation of the relevant register indicated that the facility frequently accommodated between 100 and 200 persons; the space available is totally inadequate for such numbers. Further, despite denials from staff, it subsequently became clear that, due to pressure of numbers in early July, detained foreign nationals had also been placed in the basement-level holding areas in building B; conditions in those areas are totally unsuitable for periods of detention exceeding a few hours. In addition, the information gathered indicated that the provision of mattresses and blankets was a very recent development.\nIt should also be noted that cells and sanitary facilities were in a poor state of repair and cleanliness. Moreover, detainees were still not offered any form of occupational activities (e.g. reading material, toys for children, etc.), and the CPT was particularly concerned to learn that no progress had been made as regards offering outdoor exercise.\n64. At the end of the visit, the delegation called upon the Turkish authorities to attach a high priority to the implementation of already existing plans to extend the holding facility at the Foreigners' Department at Istanbul Police Headquarters. In their reply of 19 December 2001, the Turkish authorities informed the Committee of progress made in this respect.\u201d\n15. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2006)30 Report concerning CPT's visit from 7 to 14 December 2005 are as follows:\n\u201c35. As already indicated (cf. paragraph 9), the situation observed by the CPT's delegation in the detention unit for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was the subject of an immediate observation under Article 8, paragraph 5, of the Convention. With a capacity \u2013 according to staff \u2013 of 90, the unit was holding more than double that figure (147 men and 43 women) on the day of the delegation's visit. The outrageous overcrowding and general sordidness of the conditions in the facility beggared belief, a state of affairs which is all the more serious in view of the fact that some of the detainees had been held there for more than six months.\nThe CPT first drew the Turkish authorities' attention to the unacceptable nature of the arrangements for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters as long ago as 1997, and has subsequently reemphasised this point, most recently in the report on the September 2001 visit (cf. CPT/Inf (2002) 8, paragraphs 62 to 66). Some minor improvements have been made over the years. However, the facts found during the December 2005 visit have highlighted once again the fundamental inadequacy of the existing detention unit; above all, it is too small.\n36. A solution to this long-standing problem might finally be in sight. By letter of 23 February 2006, the Turkish authorities confirmed that a much larger facility for this category of detainee, offering far better conditions, would be brought into service towards the end of 2006, once extensive renovation work at the site concerned (in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc District) had been completed.\nThe CPT calls upon the Turkish authorities to give a very high priority to the bringing into service of the above-mentioned facility; every attempt should be made to accelerate the completion of the ongoing renovation work.\nAs regards the material conditions and regime activities to be offered in the new facility and the staffing arrangements, the CPT recommends the Turkish authorities to take fully into account the standards set out in paragraph 29 of the 7th General Report on the CPT's activities (CPT/Inf (97)10).\n37. The entry into service of the new facility will in any event not occur for some months. In the meantime, steps must be taken to alleviate the intolerable situation in the existing detention unit for immigration detainees at Istanbul Police Headquarters.\nIn their letter of 23 February 2006, the Turkish authorities state that during the transitional period, immediate measures have been taken to improve conditions at the existing facility, including as regards sanitary conditions and the provision of food. The CPT would like to receive further details of the measures concerned.\nFor so long as the existing detention unit for immigration detainees remains in service, the Committee recommends that every effort be made so that the official capacity of the facility is not exceeded. Further, immediate steps must be taken to ensure that all detainees are offered outdoor exercise on a daily basis; the current situation, in which persons can spend weeks if not months without ever having access to the open air, is inadmissible.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 AND 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. Relying on Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been unlawfully detained without the possibility of challenging the lawfulness of his detention. The Government contested these arguments.\n#### A. Admissibility\n17. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n18. The Government submitted that the applicant's detention was based on section 23 of Law no. 5683 and section 4 of Law no. 5682 and that he was being held pending deportation proceedings in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. The Government further submitted that a certain A.A., an Iranian who had entered Turkey illegally and who had been detained in the K\u0131rklareli Accommodation Centre, had successfully challenged his detention and possible deportation before the administrative courts. He was consequently given a temporary residence permit. Therefore, according to the Government, administrative proceedings constituted an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined the same grievances in the case of Abdolkhani and Karimnia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125\u2011135) and the Government's example of A.A. in the case of Tehrani and Others v. Turkey (nos. 32940/08, 41626/08 and 43616/08, \u00a7\u00a7 74\u201179, 13 April 2010). It found in the former case that the placement of the applicants in the K\u0131rklareli Accommodation Centre constituted a deprivation of liberty. The Court concluded that, in the absence of clear legal provisions establishing a procedure for ordering and extending detention with a view to deportation and setting time-limits for such detention, the deprivation of liberty to which the applicants had been subjected was not \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court found in the latter case that the judicial review in the case of A.A. could not be regarded as a speedy reply to A.A.'s request; he had continued to be held in detention for another thirty days despite the court ruling regarding his release. It concluded that the Turkish legal system did not provide the applicants with a remedy whereby they could speedily obtain judicial review of the lawfulness of their detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n20. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned Abdolkhani and Karimnia or Tehrani and Others judgments.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained about the conditions of detention at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters.\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Government contended that the applicant had not exhausted the criminal and administrative remedies available to him. The Government added that the application should be declared inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. According to the Government the applicant should have introduced his complaint within six months of his release on 25 September 2004, had he considered the domestic proceedings to be ineffective. However he had lodged his complaint on 4 April 2005.\n23. The applicant reiterated his complaints. He maintained that the domestic remedies referred to by the Government were only available in theory and not effective in practice. In this connection he submitted a sample decision delivered by the Istanbul Administrative Court on 29 May 2006, in which the court rejected the objection of a certain O.\u0130., who had lodged a similar complaint about the conditions of detention at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, where he had been held for deportation purposes in September 2005. In line with the existing procedure, O.\u0130.'s complaint had been examined by the District Governorship, which had refused to start legal proceedings for lack of sufficient evidence.\n24. The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering for their acts before an international body before they have had the opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. However, the only remedies which must be tried under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are those that relate to the breaches alleged and which at the same time are available and adequate. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many others, Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, 18 September 2001).\n25. Furthermore, the Court reiterates that, in the area of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the burden of proof is on the Government to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one, available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say, that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicant's complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success. Once this burden of proof is satisfied it falls to the applicant to show that the remedy advanced by the Government had in fact been made use of, or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case, or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Kalashnikov, cited above).\n26. In connection with the above, the Court observes that the applicant submitted a decision whereby the judiciary rejected the objections of a person who had unsuccessfully attempted to initiate legal proceedings with regard to the conditions of detention in the same facility where the applicant had been held. The Court notes that, in reply to the applicant's submissions, the Government have not pointed to any examples of cases where similar complaints were examined and conditions at a foreigners' department were improved following a legal decision.\n27. The Court is therefore led to conclude that it is not established with sufficient certainty that there existed domestic remedies capable of affording redress to the applicant in relation to his complaint concerning the conditions of detention. It accordingly dismisses the Government's objection.\n28. As to the Government's complaint concerning the six-month time-limit, the Court observes that the date mentioned by the Government is in fact the date of arrival of the application forms at the Court. The Court has held in its previous judgments that the date of introduction of an application is not the Registry's stamp which indicates the arrival date (see \u015eahin Karako\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 19462/04, \u00a7\u00a7 23-25, 29 April 2008) but is the date of the first communication from the applicant indicating an intention to lodge an application (see Chalkey v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63831/00, 26 September 2002). In the present case duly completed application forms were transmitted to the Court by fax on 21 March 2005. The applicant was released on 25 September 2004. Consequently, the Court finds that the applicant lodged his application within the six-month time-limit.\n29. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n30. The Government submitted that the applicant's allegations were not substantiated and the conditions at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters met all the basic needs of the foreigners who were temporarily held for deportation purposes. The applicant reiterated his complaints.\n31. The Court reiterates that, according to the Convention organs' case-law, ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, \u00a7 162, Series A no. 25). The same holds true in so far as degrading treatment is concerned (see Costello-Roberts v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1993, \u00a7 30, Series A no. 247-C). The assessment of this minimum level of severity is relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland and Costello-Roberts, both cited above, loc. cit.). In this connection overcrowding and inadequate facilities for heating, sanitation, sleeping arrangements, food, recreation and contact with the outside world may sometimes amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. When assessing conditions of detention, account has to be taken of the cumulative effects of these conditions, as well as of specific allegations made by the applicant (see Dougoz v. Greece, no. 40907/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001\u2011II).\n32. At the outset, the Court reiterates that it has found, as mentioned above, that the applicant has been deprived of his liberty (see paragraph 19 above). Given the fact that he had been held at a facility under State supervision and against his own will, the physical conditions in this centre must comply with the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention (see Tehrani and Others, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n33. The Court observes that the applicant referred to CPT reports about the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters and further provided a detailed account of the conditions of his detention, supported by drawings of the facility. The Government in reply submitted general information regarding the detention facility (see paragraph 11 above), failing to provide details as to the number of persons held at any given period or whether they were allowed to spend any time outdoors.\n34. The Court takes note of the relevant extracts of the two aforementioned CPT reports (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above) which indicate that the CPT visited the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters some time in 1999, in September 2001 and December 2005. The applicant was held in this facility between 25 June and 25 September 2004, which falls between the CPT's last two visits. The Court points out that the findings of the CPT provide a reliable basis for the assessment of the conditions in which the applicant was imprisoned (see Kehayov v. Bulgaria, no. 41035/98, \u00a7 66, 18 January 2005). Both of these reports strongly criticise the conditions of detention, which are described thus: \u201coutrageous overcrowding and general sordidness in the facility beggared belief\u201d. The CPT further recommended in the second report that the official capacity of the facility should not be exceeded. Although the Court has not conducted an on-site visit, it notes that the applicant's allegations are corroborated by the conclusions of the CPT report. The applicant was detained for ninety days at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, which had been found to be overcrowded and fundamentally inadequate by the CPT. It appears that there were not enough beds or blankets for everybody. Additionally the Government do not specify whether the rooms had natural light or deny that the detainees were not allowed to spend time outdoors. Therefore it seems, as alleged by the applicant and supported by the second CPT report cited above, that the applicant did not have access to natural light or open air during the ninety days he was detained in the Foreigners' Department.\n35. In the light of the above, the Court considers that the conditions of detention of the applicant at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, in particular the serious overcrowding and absence of adequate sleeping facilities, combined with the lack of access to open air and the inordinate length of the period during which he was detained in such conditions, went beyond the threshold of severity under Article 3 of the Convention and amounted to degrading treatment.\nIt follows that there has been a violation of that provision.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n37. The applicant did not claim pecuniary damage. As for non-pecuniary damage, he claimed 12,000 euros (EUR). In respect of costs and expenses the applicant submitted a lawyer's contract signed for 210 Turkish liras (TRY) per hour plus 18% VAT and indicated that thirty-six hours of work had been carried out, amounting in total to TRY 9,261 (approximately EUR 4,823).\n38. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were excessive and that only costs actually incurred could be reimbursed.\n39. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated solely by the finding of violations. Having regard to the gravity of the violations and to equitable considerations, it awards the applicant the full sum claimed under this head.\n40. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant the sum of EUR 3,500 in respect of costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n41. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following sums, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 12,000 (twelve thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 3,500 (three thousand five hundred euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant's claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 19 October 2010, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nFran\u00e7oise Elens-Passos Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens\nDeputy Registrar President", "001-59863": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF \u0130NAN v.

Ferrari Bravo,\nMr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson,\nMr B. Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nMr T. Pan\u0163\u00eeru,\nMr R. Maruste, judges,\nMr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, ad hoc judge,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 31 August 1999 and on 9 October 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Article 146 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code provides:\n\u201cWhosoever shall attempt to alter or amend in whole or in part the Constitution of the Turkish Republic or to effect a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the Grand National Assembly formed under the Constitution or to prevent it by force from carrying out its functions shall be liable to the death penalty.\n...\nAccomplices to the crime specified in paragraph one, other than those specified in paragraph two, shall be punished by heavy imprisonment for not less that fifteen years and be disqualified to hold public office for life.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained about the length of the criminal proceedings against him. He alleged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government refuted the applicant\u2019s allegations. They argued that the case was complex on account of the nature of the charges the applicant faced and the need to organise a large-scale trial involving 723 defendants, including the applicant, all of whose involvement in Dev-Yol activities had to be established. They averred that these factors explained the length of the proceedings and that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities.\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings began on 1 December 1980, the date of the applicant\u2019s arrest, and are still pending before the Ankara Assize Court. They have thus already lasted more than twenty years.\n21. The Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis only permits it to consider the period of almost fourteen years and eight months that elapsed after 28 January 1987, the date of deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition (see Canko\u00e7ak v. Turkey (Sect. 1), nos. 25182/94 and 26956/95, judgment of 20 February 2001, \u00a7 26). It must nevertheless take account of the state of the proceedings at the time when the aforementioned declaration was deposited (ibid., \u00a7 25). On the critical date the proceedings had already lasted six years.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of proceedings\n22. The Court observes that the Martial Law Court took almost eight years and seven months to reach a verdict. It took the Military Court of Cassation more than four years to rule on the appeal. Furthermore, the Court of Cassation gave judgment on 27 December 1995, approximately one year after it had been seized of the case. Subsequent to the latter judgment the case was referred to the Ankara Assize Court (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi), where the criminal proceedings are still pending, and they have already lasted more than six years before that court. The Court considers that both at first instance and in the appeal proceedings there were substantial delays, which cannot be explained in terms of the admitted complexity of the case and must be considered attributable to the national authorities.\n23. Having regard to all the evidence before it and to its case-law on the subject (see \u015eahiner v. Turkey (Sect. 1), no. 29279/95, judgment of 4 September 2001, to be published in ECHR 2001-...), the Court holds that the length of the proceedings in issue did not satisfy the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n24. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n26. The applicant did not specify his claim under this head. He confined himself to stating that he requested the Court to award him compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on account of his suffering as a result of the excessive length of the proceedings against him.\n27. The Government did not make any comments on the applicant\u2019s claim.\n28. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered a certain amount of distress, having regard to the total length of the proceedings against him. Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards him the sum of FRF 100,000.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n29. The applicant did not specify his claim for reimbursement of legal costs and expenses incurred. He left the matter to be assessed by the Court.\n30. The Government did not make any observations under this head of claim either.\n31. The applicant clearly incurred some expenses in the Convention proceedings. The Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant FRF 8,000 by way of reimbursement of his costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n32. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 4,26% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to disjoin the application from other applications joined pursuant to Rule 43 \u00a7 1;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the length of the criminal proceedings;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:\n(i) 100,000 (one hundred thousand) French francs in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) 8,000 (eight thousand) French francs in respect of costs and expenses, together with any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 4,26% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 30 October 2001, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Elisabeth Palm\nRegistrar President", "001-57901": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF MAXWELL v.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n15. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n16. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c). No leave to appeal is required.\n17. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n18. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n19. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### B. Representation of appellants by counsel\n20. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### C. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n21. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n22. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n23. To extend the legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n24. The Board takes its decisions on the basis of the documents before it, which normally include copies of the Note of Appeal, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the trial judge\u2019s report on the case. The views expressed by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and counsel will also be taken into account.\n25. Although the legislation does not provide for a formal review, the Board will, as a matter of practice, when requested to do so, reconsider an application which has been refused. Such reconsideration involves the application being referred to an external reporter, who was not involved in the Board\u2019s earlier decision and who reports to the Board on the merits of the application. Otherwise, Board decisions are subject to ordinary judicial review.\n26. If the appellant proceeds with his appeal without legal aid and the court considers that, prima facie, he may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds, then the court must immediately adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the Board\u2019s decision be reviewed.\n27. The practice of the court in this regard was formalised following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Granger v. the United Kingdom of 28 March 1990 (Series A no. 174) by a Practice Note to this effect issued on 4 December 1990 by the Lord Justice General to all Appeal Court Chairmen and Clerks:\n\u201cIn any appeal where legal aid has been refused and the court considers that prima facie an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that the appellant should have legal representation in arguing his grounds, the court shall forthwith adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the decision to refuse legal aid should be reviewed.\u201c\n28. Where such a recommendation is made, legal aid is automatically granted. To this end, the Manual of Procedure of the Scottish Legal Aid Board provides in paragraph 6.12 that:\n\u201cIn these circumstances the Board will receive a letter from the High Court of Justiciary giving the details of the case where they are recommending a re-consideration of the decision to refuse. If we are asked to re-consider a decision in these circumstances, then the application should be granted automatically. The case need not be seen by a reporter or Board solicitor, but ought to be referred to the Assistant Manager for the appropriate action.\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n29. Mr Maxwell lodged his application (no. 18949/91) with the Commission on 25 March 1991. He relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, alleging that he had been refused legal aid. He also complained of the conduct of his defence by his legal representatives and of a number of other matters arising out of his trial. The applicant made further submissions under Article 13 (art. 13).\n30. On 2 April 1992, the Commission found all the complaints inadmissible with the exception of the first one which was declared admissible on 9 December 1992. In its report of 4 May 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by seventeen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n31. At the hearing on 18 April 1993, the Government requested the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 (art. 6).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant who had been sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment complained that he had been refused legal aid for his appeal against conviction in breach of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n... \u201c\nThis contention was accepted by the Commission but disputed by the Government.\n33. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3-c) attaches two conditions to an accused\u2019s right to receive legal aid. The first, \u201clack of sufficient means to pay for legal assistance\u201c, is not in dispute in the present case. The only issue before the Court is therefore whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c required that the applicant be granted such assistance free.\n34. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the manner in which paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) is to be applied in relation to appellate or cassation courts depends upon the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (see, inter alia, the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, para. 56).\n35. The Scottish system of criminal appeals grants all persons a right to appeal. No special leave is required (see paragraph 16 above). The High Court of Justiciary, in its appellate function, has wide powers to dispose of appeals (see paragraph 19 above). The procedure is not limited to specific grounds; any alleged miscarriage of justice may be challenged (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, the proceedings always involve an oral hearing at which the Crown is represented (see paragraph 18 above).\nHowever, not all appellants who qualify on financial grounds obtain legal assistance. An independent body (the Scottish Legal Aid Board) decides on the basis of a file whether an applicant has substantial grounds for taking an appeal and whether it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation (see paragraphs 21-26 above).\n36. According to the Commission the interests of justice required that Mr Maxwell be granted legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal on 21 March 1991 before the High Court of Justiciary. It referred to the Granger case previously cited, where the Court had found a violation, and concluded that there were substantial similarities between Granger and the present case.\n37. The Government sought to distinguish the two cases. In their contention, the appeal court in Granger, after hearing the appellant\u2019s submissions, considered that there was a point of substance which required further examination. Counsel for the Crown was required to present a long and elaborate argument, which the appellant could neither understand nor respond to. None of these features is to be found in the present case.\nThe Government further noted that the applicant was not obliged to address the court at the oral hearing and that counsel for the Crown does not appear to have made submissions before it.\nIn addition, Mr Maxwell could not, in any event, have found counsel willing to represent him, in view of the rules of professional ethics which impose a duty on counsel not to act for an appellant where they are satisfied that he had no proper basis for bringing an appeal (see paragraph 20 above).\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the Granger judgment, a safeguard had been introduced. The Practice Note by the Lord Justice General, dated 4 December 1990, taken in conjunction with the practice of the Scottish Legal Aid Board (see paragraphs 27 and 28 above), ensures that, in any appeal where legal aid has been refused, such aid is automatically granted where the court has reached the conclusion that, prima facie, an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and that it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds. Accordingly, under the new system, as soon as it becomes clear that an unrepresented appellant has a point which appears to be of substance, the appeal court must adjourn the appeal to enable the appellant to obtain representation and legal aid will in fact be granted. The effect is thus that there can be no repetition of the unfairness which was found to have occurred in the Granger case.\n38. The Court notes that, as the Government pointed out, there are indeed differences between the two cases. In addition, the introduction of a new practice more favourable to the unrepresented appellant is undoubtedly a positive development.\nThe legal issues in this case may not have been particularly complex. Nevertheless, that Mr Maxwell had himself formulated the grounds for his appeal (see paragraph 10 above) and that counsel was not prepared to represent him (see paragraph 37 above) does not alter the fact that without the services of a legal practitioner he was unable competently to address the court on these legal issues and thus to defend himself effectively (see, mutatis mutandis, the Pakelli v. Germany judgment of 25 April 1983, Series A no. 64, p. 18, para. 38).\nMoreover, the appeal court, as stated, had wide powers to dispose of his appeal and its decision was final. Of even greater relevance, however, the applicant had been sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. For Mr Maxwell therefore the issue at stake was an extremely important one.\n39. The Government maintained that a finding of a violation in this case might have as its consequence the ending of the automatic right of appeal thereby effectively diminishing the rights of the accused.\n40. It is not the Court\u2019s function to indicate the measures to be taken by national authorities to ensure that their appeals system satisfies the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6). Its task is solely to determine whether the system chosen by them in this connection leads to results which, in the cases which come before it, are consistent with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6) (see, inter alia, the Quaranta v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 205, p. 15, para. 30).\nThe situation in a case such as the present, involving a heavy penalty, where an appellant is left to present his own defence unassisted before the highest instance of appeal, is not in conformity with the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6).\n41. Given the nature of the proceedings, the wide powers of the High Court, the limited capacity of an unrepresented appellant to present a legal argument and, above all, the importance of the issue at stake in view of the severity of the sentence, the Court considers that the interests of justice required that the applicant be granted legal aid for representation at the hearing of his appeal.\nIn conclusion, there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\n42. Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201c\nUnder this provision Mr Maxwell sought compensation for alleged damage in an amount to be fixed by the Court but in excess of \u00a310,000. In the applicant\u2019s submission, such sum should serve as compensation for three years and four months spent in prison as a result of an unfair trial. No claim for costs was filed.\n43. The Court agrees with the Government that any non-pecuniary damage caused is sufficiently compensated by a finding that there had been a breach of Article 6 (art. 6). As far as any alleged pecuniary damage is concerned, the Court notes that it cannot speculate as to the outcome of the appeal had legal aid been granted. It therefore rejects the claim in its entirety.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention;\n2. Dismisses the claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 October 1994.\nRolv RYSSDAL\nPresident\nHerbert PETZOLD\nActing Registrar\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the concurring opinions of Mr De Meyer and Sir John Freeland are annexed to this judgment.\nR. R.\n#### H. P.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\nMy reasoning in Boner v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-B) also applies to the present case.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF SIR JOHN FREELAND\n1. I have voted with the other members of the Court for the finding that there has been a violation of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c), but the reasoning which has led me to this conclusion has in certain respects differed from theirs.\n2. On the one hand, the material before the Court has to my mind gone far to demonstrate that the possibility of Mr Maxwell\u2019s having in fact suffered any substantive injustice by virtue of his lack of legal representation at the hearing of his appeal is extremely remote. It was accepted by all the solicitors and counsel who were instructed on his behalf at the time that his appeal had no likelihood of success; and the Scottish Legal Aid Board had refused his application for legal aid for the appeal because it was not satisfied that there were substantial grounds for making the appeal. He nevertheless exercised the unfettered right of appeal to which every person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland is entitled. The appellate court judges would have been provided, well in advance of the hearing, with the appellant\u2019s written grounds of appeal, to which no answers were submitted by the prosecution, and with the other papers in the case. They would have known in advance that the appellant was to be unrepresented. In their prior consideration of the matter and at the hearing itself they would have taken particular care to determine whether any of the grounds advanced by him, however inexpertly argued, might raise a point of substance. In accordance with long tradition, they would have been at pains to ensure that he, as an appellant in person, was treated with courtesy and consideration and was not placed in a humiliating or distressing position as a result of his lack of legal expertise. Counsel for the Crown, who apparently took no active part in the hearing, would have been under a duty to draw to the court\u2019s attention any substantial arguments of which he was aware that might weigh in the appellant\u2019s favour. Lastly, if at any stage the court had concluded that Mr Maxwell might have had substantial grounds for taking the appeal, then, in conformity with the practice introduced in the wake of the Granger case, it would have immediately adjourned the hearing and legal assistance would have been provided.\n3. On the other hand, even if, as I believe, no substantive injustice has been established, that does not dispose of the question whether, in the words of sub-paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c), \u201cthe interests of justice\u201c required that Mr Maxwell should be given free legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal. Justice should not only be done, it should also be seen to be done. The appeal raised various issues of some complexity and Mr Maxwell\u2019s conviction had led to the imposition of a sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment. As regards the view taken by Mr Maxwell\u2019s solicitors and counsel and by the Legal Aid Board of the prospects of success of an appeal, lawyers may of course disagree; and it was clear from the pleadings of the Government themselves that there have been cases in which legal aid has been refused yet counsel has subsequently appeared for an appellant and won his appeal. More importantly, the Crown was represented at the hearing of the appeal (as it is in all comparable cases) by counsel who was present and able to advance a legal argument if called upon by the court to do so. Admittedly he was not called upon; but that might be simply because the absence of legal assistance left Mr Maxwell unable to persuade the court that he had an argument which required a response. Given that there was a legal issue to be addressed on Mr Maxwell\u2019s appeal and that, having regard to the severity of his sentence, so much was at stake for him, I am satisfied that his lack of legal representation for the hearing, when counsel for the Crown was present, produced at least the appearance of injustice.\n4. I have therefore, on balance, concluded that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c should have been regarded as requiring the grant to him of free legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal and that failure to grant such assistance amounted, in the circumstances, to a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).", "001-68075": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u00c7AKMAK AND OTHERS v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicants complained that the length of the compensation proceedings exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides:\n\u201c 1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...\u201d\n30. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 began on 16 February 1994 when the applicants filed their action with the Izmir Administrative Court, and ended on 28 October 1998 when the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. The period under consideration thus lasted four years and eight months before two instances.\n31. The Government submitted that the case was complicated as it raised a number of medical issues which needed to be clarified by medical experts. They contended that there was no delay attributable either to the administrative or judicial authorities.\n32. The applicants claimed that the case was not complex since it concerned the determination of a compensation claim. It was noteworthy in this connection that the administrative court required only one hearing and one expert opinion to reach its decision. Moreover, the nature of the case demanded that the proceedings be conducted expeditiously.\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many others, Sekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 26518/95, \u00a7 35, 22 January 2004, and Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, \u00a7 33, 17 February 2004).\n34. The Court considers that the case could be considered somewhat complex as it concerned allegations of medical malpractice. However, it also observes that the first-instance court only required one expert opinion to reach its decision and only needed to hold one hearing. For that reason, it is not convinced that the length of the proceedings can be explained by the complexity of the case alone.\n35. As regards the conduct of the applicants, the Court observes that it does not appear that they contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings. The Government have not argued the contrary.\n36. As to the conduct of the domestic authorities, the Court finds that the Izmir Administrative Court's handling of the case was not beyond reproach, given the existence of several unexplained periods of inactivity, in particular between 8 July 1994 and 27 January 1995, 7 April 1995 and 7 November 1995 as well as between 23 November 1995 and 18 March 1996. Nonetheless, it does not find that the proceedings before this instance warrant the conclusion that the case was processed with unreasonable delay.\n37. The Court further notes that the applicants' case lay dormant before the Supreme Administrative Court for a little less than two years after the case-file had been sent to it, together with the parties' observations. The Court has repeatedly held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time. This obligation applies also to higher courts. Nonetheless, when so applied it cannot be construed in the same way as for a first-instance court. Higher courts sometimes have to take into account considerations other than the mere chronological order in which cases are entered on the list, such as the nature of a case or the urgency it requires. Furthermore, while Article 6 requires that judicial proceedings be conducted expeditiously, it also lays emphasis on the more general principle of the proper administration of justice (see, for example, Gast and Popp v. Germany, no. 29357/95, p. 487, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000-II).\n38. Accordingly, the Court does not consider that, in the circumstances of the present case, the proceedings before this instance can be said to have exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (see, mutadis mutandis, Mehmet Kaya and Others v. Turkey, no. 54335/00, \u00a7 25, 24 June 2004, a contrario, Caillot v. France, no. 36932/97, \u00a7 26, 4 June 1999, Lambourdi\u00e8re v. France, no. 37387/97, \u00a7 32, 2 August 2000, Doma\u0144ska v. Poland, no. 74073/01, \u00a7 32, 25 May 2004, and Nuri \u00d6zkan v. Turkey, no. 50733/99, \u00a7 22, 9 November 2004).\n39. The Court has also given consideration to what was at stake for the applicants in the domestic litigation. Although the outcome of the case was of importance to them, it nevertheless finds that the length of the proceedings was in the circumstances commensurate with their interest in having a speedy determination of their compensation claim.\n40. Having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, and taking into account in particular the overall duration of the proceedings, the Court finds that the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was complied with in the present case.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 25 January 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Article 146 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code provides:\n\u201cWhosoever shall attempt to alter or amend in whole or in part the Constitution of the Turkish Republic or to effect a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the Grand National Assembly formed under the Constitution or to prevent it by force from carrying out its functions shall be liable to the death penalty.\n...\nAccomplices to the crime specified in paragraph one, other than those specified in paragraph two, shall be punished by heavy imprisonment for not less that fifteen years and be disqualified to hold public office for life.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained about the length of the criminal proceedings against him. He alleged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government refuted the applicant\u2019s allegations. They argued that the case was complex on account of the nature of the charges the applicant faced and the need to organise a large-scale trial involving 723 defendants, including the applicant, all of whose involvement in Dev-Yol activities had to be established. They averred that these factors explained the length of the proceedings and that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities.\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings began on 31 August 1981, the date of the applicant\u2019s arrest, and are still pending before the Ankara Assize Court. They have thus already lasted more than twenty years.\n21. The Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis only permits it to consider the period of almost fourteen years and eight months that elapsed after 28 January 1987, the date of deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition (see Canko\u00e7ak v. Turkey (Sect. 1), nos. 25182/94 and 26956/95, judgment of 20 February 2001, \u00a7 26). It must nevertheless take account of the state of the proceedings at the time when the aforementioned declaration was deposited (ibid., \u00a7 25). On the critical date the proceedings had already lasted five years and five months.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of proceedings\n22. The Court observes that the Martial Law Court took almost seven years and eleven months to reach a verdict. It took the Military Court of Cassation more than four years to rule on the appeal. Furthermore, the Court of Cassation gave judgment on 27 December 1995, approximately one year after it had been seized of the case. Subsequent to the latter judgment the case was referred to the Ankara Assize Court (a\u011f\u0131r ceza mahkemesi), where the criminal proceedings are still pending, and they have already lasted more than six years before that court. The Court considers that both at first instance and in the appeal proceedings there were substantial delays, which cannot be explained in terms of the admitted complexity of the case and must be considered attributable to the national authorities.\n23. Having regard to all the evidence before it and to its case-law on the subject (see \u015eahiner v. Turkey (Sect. 1), no. 29279/95, judgment of 4 September 2001, to be published in ECHR 2001-...), the Court holds that the length of the proceedings in issue did not satisfy the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n24. There has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n26. The applicant did not specify his claim under this head. He confined himself to stating that he requested the Court to award him compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage on account of his suffering as a result of the excessive length of the proceedings against him.\n27. The Government did not make any comments on the applicant\u2019s claim.\n28. The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered a certain amount of distress, having regard to the total length of the proceedings against him. Deciding on an equitable basis, it awards him the sum of FRF 100,000.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n29. The applicant did not specify his claim for reimbursement of legal costs and expenses incurred. He left the matter to be assessed by the Court.\n30. The Government did not make any observations under this head of claim either.\n31. The applicant clearly incurred some expenses in the Convention proceedings. The Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant FRF 8,000 by way of reimbursement of his costs and expenses.\n#### C. Default interest\n32. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in France at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 4,26% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Decides to disjoin the application from other applications joined pursuant to Rule 43 \u00a7 1;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the length of the criminal proceedings;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:\n(i) 100,000 (one hundred thousand) French francs in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) 8,000 (eight thousand) French francs in respect of costs and expenses, together with any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 4,26% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 30 October 2001, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nMichael O\u2019Boyle Elisabeth Palm\nRegistrar President", "001-66782": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF MURAT KILI\u00c7 v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant domestic law at the material time may be found in Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV; \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VII; \u00d6zel v. Turkey, no. 42739/98, 7 November 2002, and Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, 23 October 2003.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal on account of the presence of the military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He invoked Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n18. The Government replied that the rules then in force governing the appointment of military judges to the State Security Courts and the guarantees which they enjoyed in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n19. The Court notes that it has examined similar grievances in the past and has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among many other authorities, \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 6 February 2003). It sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the instant case. It is reasonable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for having been involved in an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fears as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal, cited above, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n20. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n22. The applicant claimed a total of 296,000,000 euros (EUR) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n23. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s claim. They maintained that the sums claimed were excessive and unjustified.\n24. Regarding the question of pecuniary damage, the Court considers in the first place that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings before the State Security Court might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports 1997-I, \u00a7 85). Moreover, the applicant\u2019s claim in respect of pecuniary damage has not been substantiated by any evidence whatsoever. It therefore makes no award under this head.\n25. With regard to non-pecuniary damage, the Court considers that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 49).\n26. Where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted by a tribunal which is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant is granted in due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (see Gen\u00e7el, cited above, \u00a7 27).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n27. The applicant claimed a total of EUR 12,500 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the domestic authorities and before the Strasbourg institutions.\n28. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s claim. They submitted that the claim in respect of costs and expenses had not been duly documented.\n29. The Court will make an award in respect of costs and expenses in so far as these were actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum (see Sawicka v. Poland, no. 37645/97, \u00a7 54, 1 October 2002).\n30. Making its own estimate based on the information available and having regard to the criteria laid down in its case-law (see, among other authorities, Uzunhasano\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 35070/97, \u00a7 33, 20 April 2004), the Court considers it reasonable to award the applicant EUR 3,000 under this head less the sum of EUR 630 received in legal aid from the Council of Europe.\n#### C. Default interest\n31. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n2. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 3,000 (three thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses, to be converted into the national currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement, less EUR 630 (six hundred thirty euros) granted by way of legal aid, plus any tax that may be chargeable;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 30 September 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS\u00f8ren Nielsen Christos Rozakis\nRegistrar President", "001-58838": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF FOXLEY v.

Costa, President,\nMr W. Fuhrmann,\nMr L. Loucaides,\nMr P. K\u016bris,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nSir Nicolas Bratza, Judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 October 1999 and 30 May 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nInterception of correspondence\n24. Section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Where a bankruptcy order has been made, the court may from time to time, on the application of the official receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, order the Post Office to re-direct and send or deliver to the official receiver or trustee or otherwise any postal packet (within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1953) which would otherwise be sent or delivered by them to the bankrupt at such place or places as may be specified in the order.\n2. An order under this section has effect for such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified in the order.\u201d\n25. Trustees in Bankruptcy have other statutory powers, which are more stringent than the power to apply for a re-direction order but which may nonetheless need to be used, in appropriate cases, if Trustees are properly to investigate the bankrupt\u2019s affairs for the ultimate benefit of his creditors. In particular, under section 365 of the Insolvency Act 1986 a Trustee may obtain a warrant authorising him to seize property, books and/or records falling into the debtor\u2019s estate. Furthermore, section 366 of the Act allows the court (on application by a Trustee) to summon a variety of persons before it to give an affidavit and/or produce documents.\n26. A bankrupt owes a statutory duty, pursuant to section 333 of the Insolvency Act 1986, to give to the Trustee such information as to his affairs, attend meetings with the Trustee and do such other things as the Trustee may reasonably require for the carrying out of his relevant functions.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of article 8 of the convention\n27. The applicant complained that his correspondence, including correspondence with his legal advisers, was intercepted over the period 27 September 1996 to 18 January 1997 by the Post Office on behalf of the Trustee in Bankruptcy. The applicant invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n28. The applicant further contended that the failure of the relevant legislation and the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 to protect his correspondence with the European Commission on Human Rights and with the lawyers advising him on his application to that institution must also be considered an inference with the exercise of his right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention.\n##### 1. Whether there was an interference\n29. The Government did not dispute that there was an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. However, in their submission the impugned interference found its justification in application of the provisions of paragraph 2 of that Article.\n30. The Court observes that the following letters were among the correspondence re-directed to the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy before the expiry of the Order of 27 September 1996 (see paragraph 19 above): two letters from the Legal Aid Board, two letters from the Legal Department of the applicant\u2019s representative organisation, a letter from the Police Complaints Authority and a letter from the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence Police. Each of these letters was copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant. Furthermore, there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 when the Order had expired. One delivery was received on 30 December 1996, the other on 10 January 1997. A number of items in these deliveries were read and copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).\nFor the Court, the measures applied to the applicant\u2019s correspondence were an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d, within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2, with the exercise of the right guaranteed to the applicant under paragraph 1 of the provision. Indeed, the Government have not sought to argue to the contrary.\n##### 2. Justification for the interference\n31. Such interference breaches Article 8 unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and is, in addition, \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve those aims.\n(a) Whether the interference was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d\n32. The applicant contended that the Insolvency Act 1986 (\u201cthe 1986 Act\u201d) did not define with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of the exercise of discretion to re-direct and intercept mail. He observed in this connection that neither the 1986 Act nor the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 made any provision for dealing with legally privileged materials. The applicant further stressed that his correspondence continued to be re-directed after the date of expiry of the Order and was read and copied to file. Moreover, Ms S.D. was both the Trustee in Bankruptcy and the Receiver, and in the former capacity had access to, read, copied and retained legally privileged communications concerning his challenge to the enforcement of the confiscation Order. For these reasons, the applicant maintained that the measures applied to his correspondence could not be considered to satisfy the requirement at issue.\n33. The Government disagreed. They stated that the impeached measure was in accordance with the clear terms of the Order which the Trustee in Bankruptcy obtained from the court under section 371 of the 1986 Act. Although there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after the Order had expired on 27 December 1996, neither fell into the category of correspondence covered by legal professional privilege (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, the fact that these letters were re-directed after the expiry of the Order was explained by the delay in implementing the procedures for discontinuing the re-direction of letters.\n34. The Court recalls that the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d implies conditions which go beyond the existence of a legal basis in domestic law and requires that the legal basis be \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201cforeseeable\u201d (see the Amann v. Switzerland judgment of 16 February 2000, to be published in the Court\u2019s official reports, \u00a7 56). Having regard to the terms of both section 371 of the 1986 Act and the re-direction Order (see paragraphs 24 and 16 above), the Court accepts that there was a legal basis for the interception of the applicant\u2019s correspondence up until 27 December 1996 and its perusal and copying to file by the Trustee in Bankruptcy. It further accepts that the Trustee in Bankruptcy\u2019s discretion to open, read and make copies of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was not open-ended but confined to particular items which might assist her in her capacity of Trustee in locating and securing the applicant\u2019s assets for the benefit of his creditors. It is to be noted that the applicant was at the material time a bankrupt. That his Trustee in Bankruptcy might have resort to the measure at issue must have been foreseeable, all the more since the applicant was legally represented in the bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn the Court\u2019s opinion, the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence between 27 September 1996 and 27 December 1996 satisfied the qualitative conditions inherent in the \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d requirement.\n35. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence continued after the expiry of the Order. The Government do not dispute the fact that two mail deliveries were re-directed by the Post Office to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after the expiry date. It is to be noted that, regardless of the alleged breakdown in the administrative arrangements for re-directing the applicant\u2019s correspondence relied on by the Government, it nevertheless remains the case that the Trustee in Bankruptcy exercised her discretion to open letters and to retain copies of some of them. In the view of the Court, the Trustee in Bankruptcy must be taken to have known that the re-direction Order which she herself applied for and obtained no longer provided her with a legal basis to interfere with the applicant\u2019s correspondence. On that account, the actions of the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 were not in accordance with the law. For that reason, there has been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and the Court does not consider it necessary to examine with respect to these particular items of correspondence whether the other conditions of paragraph 2 of that Article were complied with.\n(b) Whether the interference before the expiry of the re-direction Order pursued a legitimate aim\n36. The applicant did not contest the Government\u2019s view that the measures directed against his correspondence during the validity of the re-direction Order were intended to protect the rights of his creditors.\n37. The Court observes that the Trustee in Bankruptcy sought and was granted the re-direction Order to enable her to identify and secure the assets of the applicant, a bankrupt, with a view to their distribution to his creditors. Authorising the Trustee in Bankruptcy to have access to the applicant\u2019s correspondence during the period covered by the Order can be considered to be in furtherance of the protection of the \u201crights of others\u201d within the meaning Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Court concludes therefore that the interference pursued a legitimate aim.\n(c) Whether the interference before the expiry of the re-direction Order was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d\n38. The applicant highlighted what he considered to be the unacceptable scope of the powers granted to the Trustee in Bankruptcy, in particular to have access to correspondence with his legal advisers, photocopy such correspondence and retain a copy of it. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the re-direction Order could have excluded the re-direction of clearly marked legally privileged materials without impairing the aim of the Order. The applicant stressed in this respect that the Government did not contradict his argument that the envelopes containing correspondence with his representative organisation in the Convention proceedings, Liberty, were clearly identified on the outside.\n39. The applicant drew attention to the fact that, in addition to his correspondence with Liberty, the Trustee in Bankruptcy also copied and retained five letters passing between the applicant and S.K. who was acting on his behalf as an insolvency consultant and legal adviser in the domestic proceedings involving the Receiver. The applicant maintained that Ms S.D., as Trustee in Bankruptcy, must have been aware that she was the opponent of S.K. in the domestic litigation. For her to open, read, copy and retain S.K.\u2019s correspondence with the applicant amounted to a serious invasion of professional secrecy.\n40. The Government replied that the interference was proportionate in its effect on the applicant\u2019s right under Article 8. The applicant had not co-operated in the receivership proceedings and there was concern that suspected unsecured foreign assets might be dissipated if measures were not taken to identify those assets. The decision to authorise interception of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was taken after consideration had been given to other, more stringent, options available to the Trustee in Bankruptcy (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).\n41. The Government further maintained that there was no reliable method of distinguishing letters which might assist the Trustee in Bankruptcy in the performance of her duties from other categories of correspondence such as letters from legal advisers. The envelope was of no assistance in this respect. Indeed, the Trustee in Bankruptcy was attentive to the applicant\u2019s concern that his correspondence from the applicant\u2019s legal advisers or the Convention institutions might be opened. She informed him that no such letters would be opened if the envelope clearly indicated the sender (see paragraph 21 above). The Government stated in this connection that there was no benefit to Ms S.D. as Receiver in attempting to gain further information under the re-direction Order for the purposes of the receivership proceedings instigated under the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Under the confiscation Order of 8 August 1996 (see paragraph 14 above) the only powers available to Ms S.D. were to gain control of title documents to specified assets. It was left to the Crown Prosecution Service and the applicant to litigate the beneficial ownership of the assets. In her capacity as Trustee in Bankruptcy, Ms S.D.\u2019s primary function was to locate and secure further assets for the benefit of the applicant\u2019s creditors.\n42. The applicant replied that even if considerations of pragmatism may have some bearing on the reason why privileged correspondence could not be separated from other correspondence by the Post Office before mail was re-directed, there could be no pragmatic justification for the selective and systematic copying and retention of privileged correspondence.\n43. The Court recalls that the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In determining whether an interference is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d regard may be had to the State\u2019s margin of appreciation (see the Campbell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233, p. 18, \u00a7 44). It further observes that in the field under consideration - the concealment of a bankrupt\u2019s assets to the detriment of his creditors - the authorities may consider it necessary to have recourse to the interception of a bankrupt\u2019s correspondence in order to identify and trace the sources of his income. Nevertheless, the implementation of the measures must be accompanied by adequate and effective safeguards which ensure minimum impairment of the right to respect for his correspondence. This is particularly so where, as in the case at issue, correspondence with the bankrupt\u2019s legal advisers may be intercepted. The Court notes in this connection that the lawyer-client relationship is, in principle, privileged and correspondence in that context, whatever its purpose, concerns matters of a private and confidential nature (the above-mentioned Campbell judgment, pp. 18-19, \u00a7\u00a7 46 and 48).\n44. Admittedly, as the Government have pointed out, it may be difficult to identify from the envelope whether its contents attract legal professional privilege. However, the Government have not challenged the accuracy of the applicant\u2019s allegations that letters from his legal advisers, once opened, were read, photocopied and a copy committed to file before being forwarded to him. The Court can see no justification for this procedure and considers that the action taken was not in keeping with the principles of confidentiality and professional privilege attaching to relations between a lawyer and his client. It notes in this connection that the Government have not sought to argue that the privileged channel of communication was being abused; nor have they invoked any other exceptional circumstances which would serve to justify the interference with reference to their margin of appreciation.\n45. The Court would further observe that the fact that the Trustee in Bankruptcy was also the court-appointed Receiver made it even more compelling to forward, unread, the applicant\u2019s correspondence from his legal adviser in connection with the receivership proceedings. However, and the Government have not contradicted the applicant\u2019s declaration, the Trustee in Bankruptcy retained copies of the relevant letters before transmitting them to the applicant.\n46. For the above reasons, the Court finds that there was no pressing social need for the opening, reading and copying to file of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with his legal advisers and that, accordingly, the interference was not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2.\n47. Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 8 in that respect. For that reason, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine the applicant\u2019s assertion that the facts of the case also give rise to an interference with the exercise of his right of individual petition pursuant to Article 34 of the Convention.\n### II. alleged violation of article 6 of the convention\n48. The applicant maintained that the interception of correspondence between himself and his legal advisers concerning the proceedings relating to the enforcement of the confiscation Order violated Article 6 of the Convention, which provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... . ...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ...\nc. to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing ... .\u201d\n49. The Government disagreed. In their submission, to the extent that there may be concerns about the interception of correspondence from the applicant\u2019s legal advisers, those concerns fell to be considered from the standpoint of Article 8 of the Convention. They further maintained that, in any event, the re-direction of the applicant\u2019s letters did not amount to a breach of Article 6.\n50. The Court recalls that, where a lawyer is involved, an encroachment on professional secrecy may have repercussions on the proper administration of justice and hence on the rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention (see the Niemietz v. Germany judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251-B, pp. 35-36, \u00a7 37). However, the applicant has not provided the Court with any information on the conduct and outcome of the receivership proceedings (see paragraph 23 above). In these circumstances, and having regard to its finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention.\niii. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n51. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n52. The applicant stated that he is the victim of a very serious violation of his Article 8 right, having regard, inter alia, to the absence of safeguards in respect of the interception of his correspondence and the deliberate abuse of power by the Trustee in Bankruptcy which had had the effect of undermining legal professional privilege in litigation to which she herself was a party as Receiver. The applicant considered that a sizeable award was appropriate in the circumstances and claimed, in consequence, the sum of GBP 3,500 by way of compensation for the moral damage including the sense of humiliation which he had suffered.\n53. The Government observed that the alleged breach was minimal and essentially technical in nature and resulted in no quantifiable damage. In the Government\u2019s submission, a finding of a violation of the Convention would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction in the circumstances.\n54. The Court considers that the alleged non-pecuniary damage is adequately compensated by the finding of violations of Article 8 of the Convention.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n55. The applicant claimed the sum of GBP 8,482.33 inclusive of value-added tax (VAT) by way of compensation for costs and expenses incurring in the Convention proceedings. This amount was made up of fees and expenses as assessed by the applicant\u2019s representative, Liberty, as well as fees charged by counsel. The applicant observed that the amount claimed reflected the work devoted to the processing of the complaints declared admissible by the Court to the exclusion of costs and expenses incurred in unsuccessfully arguing the admissibility of his complaint under Article 7 of the Convention.\nThe applicant received the sum of FRF 4,100 by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.\n56. The Government submitted that an overall sum of GBP 4,000 inclusive of VAT would be a more realistic award. They considered in this connection that the applicant had underestimated the time and effort devoted to his pleadings on his Article 7 complaint which had been declared inadmissible by the Court. Furthermore, in the Government\u2019s opinion the hourly rate charged by counsel should be reduced, as should, inter alia, the amounts claimed by the applicant for \u201canticipated costs\u201d.\n57. The Court, deciding on an equitable basis, awards the applicant the sum of GBP 6,000 minus the amount already received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe.\n#### C. Default interest\n58. According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 7.5% per annum.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT unanimously\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as regards the interception of the applicant\u2019s correspondence following the expiry of the period of the validity of the re-direction Order;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention as regards the interception of the applicant\u2019s correspondence covered by legal professional privilege during the period of the validity of the re-direction Order;\n3. Holds that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint concerning an alleged interference with the exercise of his right of individual petition provided in Article 34 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 6 of the Convention;\n5. Holds that a finding of violations of Article 8 of the Convention constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the alleged non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n##### 6. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, for costs and expenses, GBP 6,000 (six thousand pounds sterling) inclusive of VAT, minus the sum of FRF 4,100 (four thousand one hundred French francs) received from the Council of Europe by way of legal aid;\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 7.5% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\n7. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claims for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 June 2000, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d.\n15. The Government contested that argument and submitted that in the course of the proceedings, the Administrative Court and the Council of State had each rendered two decisions. The case had been a complex one and numerous hearings were held in the course of these proceedings. There were no delays which could be attributable to the national authorities.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n17. The Court observes that the proceedings began on 17 January 1993 when the applicant filed an action before the Ankara Administrative Court, and ended on 15 November 2002 when the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers upheld the first-instance court's judgment. The proceedings thus lasted nine years and ten months during which four decisions have been rendered. In this connection the Court would point out that it took the Council of State almost two years and nine months to render its decision. Furthermore, the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers did not decide on the appeal for a period of almost two and a half years. These delays contributed substantially to the total length of the proceedings.\n18. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n19. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n20. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n22. The applicant claimed 1,300 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and EUR 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n23. The Government contested these claims.\n24. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects the claim in respect of pecuniary damage. On the other hand, it awards the applicant EUR 5,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n25. The applicant also claimed EUR 5,150 for the fees of his legal representative and the costs and expenses associated with the bringing of his case before the Court.\n26. The Government contested the claim.\n27. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,000 covering costs under all heads.\n#### C. Default interest\n28. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 5,500 (five thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 1,000 (one thousand euros) in respect of his costs and expenses, plus any tax that may be chargeable; to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant complained that the length of the first set of proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n21. The Government contested that argument.\n22. The period to be taken into consideration began on 7 February 1992 and ended on 30 May 2002. It thus lasted approximately ten years and three months before two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n23. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n24. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n25. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n26. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on this ground.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant further complained under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.1 that the awards made by the Ankara Administrative Court in respect of compensation and his lawyer's costs and expenses were insufficient and disproportionate. He finally alleged under Article 14 of the Convention that he had not been appointed to a post in the civil service on account of his political opinions.\n28. The Court finds nothing in the case file which might disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly-ill founded and must be rejected, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n30. The applicant claimed 20,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.\n31. The Government submitted that the amount claimed was excessive and should not lead to unjust enrichment.\n32. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. However, the Court considers that the applicant must have sustained non\u2011pecuniary damage. Accordingly, it awards the applicant EUR 6,500 in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n33. The applicant also claimed EUR 5,000 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n34. The Government contended that the applicant's claim was unsubstantiated.\n35. According to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the above criteria and the applicant's failure to substantiate his claim, the Court makes no award under this heading.\n#### C. Default interest\n36. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaint concerning the excessive length of the proceedings admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2.

Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that, although he was a minor at the time, he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n13. The Government maintained in the first place that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since at no stage of the domestic proceedings did he rely on the fact that he had been deprived of his right to legal assistance during police custody. In the alternative, they stated that the application was introduced outside the six months time-limit, since the applicant was represented by a lawyer during his trial after 3 September 2001. In the alternative, relying on the Court\u2019s case-law in the Okul v. Turkey decision (no. 45358/99, 4 September 2003), they considered that the six months time-limit should run from 8 July 2002, the date on which the Court of Cassation delivered its decision.\n14. The Court notes that the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, this restriction was applied as a blanket rule and the applicant could not request the benefit of legal assistance during his police custody. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant failed to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). Furthermore, in the Okul decision, referred to by the Government, the Court had referred to Article 324 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that, if the Court of Cassation holds a hearing, it should deliver its decision within one week following that hearing. However, in the present case, the Court of Cassation did not hold a hearing on the merits of the case.\n15. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is not entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision and if she or he was represented by a lawyer during the domestic proceedings, as in the present case, the date on which the final domestic decision was deposited with the registry of the first-instance court should be taken as the starting-point under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, being the latest date by which the applicant or his or her representative was definitively able to find out about the content of the final decision (see \u0130pek v. Turkey (dec.), no. 39706/98, 7 November 2000). In the present case, the decision dated 8 July 2002 was deposited with the Registry of the Adana State Security Court on 21 August 2002. As the applicant lodged his application with the Court on 4 February 2002, the Court considers that he has lodged his application with the Court within the six month time-limit, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Consequently, the Government\u2019s objection cannot be upheld.\n16. At this point, the Court observes that, after the introduction of the present application with the Court, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were reopened following several amendments in the national legislation. At the end of the trial, the domestic courts found the applicant guilty under Article 215 of Law no. 5326, but deferred sentencing. As a result, the applicant was placed under supervision for a period of five years and the conviction was not noted in his criminal record. However, before this decision, the applicant had already been serving his prison sentence between 11 September 2002 and 15 September 2003. Consequently, the applicant can still be considered as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Birdal v. Turkey, no. 53047/99, \u00a7 24, 2 October 2007; a contrario, Ko\u00e7 and Tamba\u015f (dec.), no. 46947/99, 24 February 2005).\n17. The Court notes that this remaining part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds and must therefore be declared admissible.\n18. As regards the merits, the Court observes that it has already examined the same grievance in the case of Salduz v. Turkey and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-62, 27 November 2008). In that judgment, the Court held that, the restriction imposed on the right of access to a lawyer was systematic and applied to anyone held in police custody during that period, regardless of his or her age, in connection with an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned Salduz judgment.\n19. The Court notes that one of the specific elements of the instant case was the applicant\u2019s age. Having regard to a significant number of relevant international law materials concerning legal assistance to minors in police custody (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 32-36), the Court stresses the fundamental importance of such a service (ibidem, \u00a7 60).\n20. In view of the above, the Court holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n21. As regards just satisfaction under Article 41 of the Convention, the applicant requested 40,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 40,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He also requested EUR 5,000 in respect of legal fees and EUR 300 in respect of costs and expenses. In support of his requests, he submitted an invoice from a translator in the amount of EUR 200. The Government contested the claims.\n22. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged; it therefore rejects this claim. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, ruling on an equitable basis, it awards EUR 1,500 to the applicant.\n23. The Court further considers that the most appropriate form of redress would be the re-trial of the applicant in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, should he so request (see Salduz, cited above, \u00a7 72).\n24. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court finds it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 200 under this head.\n25. The Court further finds it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1, on account of the lack of legal assistance to the applicant while in police custody;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 200 (two hundred euros) plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 February 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained in the first place that he had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court. The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. They maintained that the applicant had not invoked this complaint before the domestic courts. In this respect, they referred to the case-law of the Court (in particular Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V).\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Vural v. Turkey, no. 56007/00, \u00a7 22, 21 December 2004, \u00c7olak v. Turkey (no. 1), no. 52898/99, \u00a7 24, 15 July 2004, and \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7 25). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n20. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n21. In the light of its established case-law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court\n22. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts. Finally, they stated that the State Security Courts had been abolished as of 2004.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 6 February 2003).\n24. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for aiding and abetting an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fear as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n25. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. As to the remainder of the complaints submitted under Article 6\n26. The Government maintained that the written opinion of the Chief Public Prosecutor had been submitted to the Court of Cassation and it was read out to the applicant\u2019s representative during the hearing. The Government argued that, before the hearing, the applicant\u2019s representative had sufficient time to find out about the submissions made by the Chief Public Prosecutor and to submit additional grounds of appeal. The Government also referred to the legislative amendment of 2003, which regulated the ex officio notification of the written opinion of the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation.\n27. Having regard to its finding that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45, Durmaz and Others v. Turkey, nos. 46506/99, 46569/99, 46570/99 and 46939/99, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 14 October 2004, and I\u015f\u0131k v. Turkey, no. 44057/98, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40, 24 June 2003).\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicant requested the Court to award him 200,000 Euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 200,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n30. The Government submitted that these claims were excessive and unacceptable.\n31. On the question of pecuniary damage, the Court considers in the first place that it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of proceedings compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 would have been. Moreover, the applicant\u2019s claims in respect of pecuniary damage are not supported by any evidence whatsoever. The Court cannot therefore allow them.\n32. The Court further considers that the finding of a violation of Article 6 constitutes in itself sufficient compensation for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant in this respect (see Incal, cited above, p. 1575, \u00a7 82, and \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n33. Where the Court finds that an applicant has been convicted by a tribunal which is not independent and impartial within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1, it considers that, in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure that the applicant is granted in due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal (Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, \u00a7 27, 23 October 2003).\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n34. The applicant did not seek reimbursement of any costs and expenses in connection with the proceedings before the Court.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n##### 1. Declares the remainder of the application admissible;\n2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as regards the complaint relating to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court;\n3 Holds that there is no need to examine the remaining complaint submitted under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n4. Holds that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 15 March 2005, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS.

Traja,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMrs P. Hirvel\u00e4, judges,\nand Mr T.L. Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n14. A description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Da\u015f v. Turkey (no. 74411/01, \u00a7 18, 8 November 2005).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty as there had been no reasonable suspicion for his arrest. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so...\u201d\n16. The Government did not comment on this complaint.\n17. The Court reiterates that having a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned might have committed the offence (Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, \u00a7 32). However, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at a later stage of the process of criminal investigation (Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27 \u00a7 55).\n18. The Court observes that the applicant was arrested during the course of a police operation carried out against the PKK. According to the arrest protocol, which was signed by the applicant, a search warrant had been issued against him and the applicant had attempted to escape when the police officers asked him to show his identity card.\n19. The Court considers that the aforementioned elements are sufficient to support the conclusion that there was \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the applicant\u2019s arrest. The fact that the proceedings against him were subsequently suspended does not of itself call into question the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).\n20. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 AND 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that he had been held in police custody for seven days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power. He further complained under Article 13 of the Convention that he had no remedy in domestic law to challenge the lawfulness of his detention in police custody.\nThe Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 13 should be examined from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention read as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Government submitted that the application should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that the applicant had failed to invoke Article 5 of the Convention before the domestic authorities and to challenge the decision to extend his custody period. The Government further maintained that the applicant could have sought compensation under Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained.\n23. The Court notes that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in similar cases (see, for example, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 66-71, ECHR 2005\u2011... and Da\u015f, cited above, \u00a7 18). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence.\n24. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objections.\n25. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n26. The Government argued that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody was in conformity with the legislation in force at the material time. They further maintained that the relevant domestic law had been amended in accordance with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n27. The applicant reiterated his allegations.\n28. The Court has already accepted on a number of occasions that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 61; Murray, cited above, \u00a7 58; Demir and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, p. 2653, \u00a7 41). This does not mean, however, that the authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects and detain them in police custody, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, in the final instance, by the Convention\u2019s supervisory institutions, whenever they consider that there has been a terrorist offence (see, among others, Murray, cited above, \u00a7 58).\n29. The Court notes that the applicant was taken into police custody on 21 July 1999 and released on 27 July 1999. His detention in police custody thus lasted at least six days. It reiterates that in the Brogan and Others case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to time laid down by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism (see Brogan and Others, cited above, p. 33, \u00a7 62).\n30. Even supposing that the activities of which the applicant stood accused were linked to a terrorist threat, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain him for six days without being brought before a judge.\n31. There has, accordingly, been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention\n32. The Government contended that Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was in force at the material time, provided an effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of detention in police custody.\n33. The applicant reiterated his allegations.\n34. The Court reiterates that in several cases raising similar questions to those in the present case, it rejected the Government\u2019s aforementioned submission and found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention (see, among others, \u00d6calan, cited above, \u00a7 76 and, Sak\u0131k and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports 1997\u2011VII, \u00a7 54). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned cases.\n35. In conclusion, the Court holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention that his right to the presumption of innocence had been violated since, subsequent to his arrest, there had been news reports in newspapers, on radio stations and on television channels, in which he had been presented as a criminal.\n37. The Government did not comment on this complaint.\n38. The Court observes that the applicant did not submit any materials in support of his complaint. Nor did he allege that the authorities had presented him to the media as a criminal. It therefore considers that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaint under this head.\n39. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### IV. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 14 AND 18 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. The applicant complained under Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his ethnic origin. He further alleged under Article 18 of the Convention that the respondent State had applied restrictions on the exercise of his rights in violation of the Convention.\n41. The Government did not address these issues.\n42. The Court notes that the applicant has not substantiated his complaints under these provisions.\n43. It follows that these complaints are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n44. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n45. The applicant claimed 3,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and EUR 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n46. The Government contested these claims.\n47. The Court does not discern any causal link between the violations found and the pecuniary damage alleged. It therefore rejects this claim.\n48. On the other hand, it accepts that the applicant suffered non\u2011pecuniary damage such as distress resulting from his detention for six days without the opportunity to challenge its lawfulness, which cannot be sufficiently compensated by the finding of a violation. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n49. The applicant also claimed EUR 6,837 for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n50. The Government submitted that these claims were unsubstantiated. They argued that no documents had been provided by the applicant to prove his claims.\n51. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of his costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum (see Sawicka v. Poland, no. 37645/97, \u00a7 54, 1 October 2002). In the present case, regard being had to the information in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 1,500 for the proceedings before the Court.\n#### C. Default interest\n52. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Declares the complaints concerning the failure of the authorities to bring the applicant promptly before a judge and his inability to challenge the lawfulness of his detention admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;\n##### 2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention;\n##### 3. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention;\n##### 4. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into new Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 1,500 (one thousand five hundred euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(b) that from the expiry of the abovementioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n5. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nT.L.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Freedom of association\n16. Freedom of association is guaranteed in the Swedish constitution. Chapter 2, section 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is guaranteed:\n1. freedom of expression: the freedom to communicate information and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations or in any other way; ...\n5. freedom of association: the freedom to unite with others for public or private purposes; ...\u201d\nChapter 2, section 2 protects, inter alia, the negative aspect of freedom of association. It reads:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is protected against coercion to divulge an opinion in a political, religious, cultural or other such connection. In relation to the public administration, he is furthermore protected against coercion to participate in a meeting for the formation of opinion or in a demonstration or other manifestation of opinion, or to belong to a political association, religious congregation or other association for opinions referred to in the first sentence.\u201d\n17. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work (Lag om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet, SFS 1976:580, hereinafter \u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) guarantees the right of employers and employees to form, belong to and work for labour market organisations. The right of association is further protected by section 8, which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it.\n#### B. The relationship between employers and employees\n18. Section 10 of the 1976 Act gives employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees. It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees, who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions.\n19. Under section 26 of the 1976 Act, a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s organisations but also on their members, i.e. companies and individual workers. Moreover, in practice, the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect. This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise.\n20. Under section 27 of the 1976 Act, an employer and an employee cannot conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound. This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void. While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers. Consequently, while the contracts in question remain valid, the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union.\n#### C. The monitoring system\n21. Monitoring of wages for hourly work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch. It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union\u2019s representatives to the employer. If a mistake is discovered, clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter. In some cases, formal negotiations are required.\n22. Under the terms of the Construction Agreement, the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work. The fee \u2013 1.5% of the employee\u2019s wages \u2013 is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual worker.\n23. According to the applicants, a member of the Union pays about 3,500 Swedish kronor (SEK)0 per year in monitoring fees in addition to the union membership fee of SEK 3,000. The largest competing trade union, the Syndicalist union, does not have a monitoring system. The Union therefore has a de facto monopoly in this field.\n24. The regulation regarding the monitoring of wages was incorporated in the 1976 Construction Agreement. Previously, workers paid time-based wages had not been subjected to deductions for monitoring fees. According to the applicants, the purpose was that workers paid time-based wages, as an act of solidarity with workers carrying out piecework, should contribute to the whole inspection system. At the material time, the majority of the workers performed piecework, the measurement of which was costly and time-consuming. The fee for monitoring time-based wages was thus not primarily introduced as reimbursement for the service in question, but as a means of supporting the measurement of piecework wages.\n25. Today, approximately 80% of workers are paid time-based wages, which is almost the opposite ratio compared to the situation in 1976. In general, the monitoring of wages is now computerised and based on information provided by the employer.\n26. According to a statement of 24 May 2006 by Mr Lars-G\u00f6ran Bromander, former division manager at Byggettan, a review of the still existing audit material for 1999 showed that, as a result of the monitoring work, wages had been adjusted upwards for 648 workers, of which 250 were not Union members.\n27. The activities of Byggettan, the local union branch, are divided into two parts: branch activities (inter alia, wage negotiations, union agitation and political work) and business activities (i.e. the inspection work, comprised of the monitoring of time-based wages and the measurement of piecework). Branch or non-profit activities are to be paid for by means of union membership fees. Revenue from the business activities, which is subject to value-added tax, should cover the costs of such activities.\n#### D. Figures concerning monitoring and measuring work\n28. The parties have submitted various documents to the Court containing information on the revenue and cost of the activities of the Building Workers\u2019 Union and the Byggettan branch. The following information has been compiled from these documents.\n##### 1. The annual reports of Byggettan\n29. According to the annual report for 1998, Byggettan had 94 permanent employees (54 officials and 40 administrative personnel) on 31 December 1998. Before the Labour Court, the Building Workers\u2019 Union stated that the number of persons involved in inspection work (monitoring and measuring) during the period relevant to the present case, March \u2013 July 1999, was the same as at the end of 1998, and that the 1998 annual report named 21 officials who had been occupied with this activity. However, the annual report only mentions, in addition to the head of the relevant department, 12 officials who were dealing with such work, one of whom had been doing so only until 26 March 1998. It thus appears that, during the relevant period, 12-13 officials were involved in inspection work, i.e. about 22-24% of the total number of officials. Incidentally, the annual report for 1999 indicates that, at the end of 1999, the total workforce of Byggettan remained the same.\n30. Byggettan\u2019s annual reports for 1997-2000 contain statements of accounts where its business activities, i.e. the inspection work, are separated from its branch activities. According to the statement of accounts for 1999, Byggettan\u2019s branch activities showed a loss of SEK 10.3 million, whereas the inspection work recorded a profit of SEK 5 million. The total revenue from the inspection work amounted to SEK 30.9 million, the operational and administrative costs of this sector of activity were SEK 25.2 million and the write-offs of movables came to SEK 0.7 million. Whereas it is shown, in a footnote to the statement of accounts, that, of the revenue from the inspection work, SEK 21.6 million derived from monitoring fees, there is no such differentiation as regards the costs.\nHowever, in another footnote, information is provided on Byggettan\u2019s costs, which are given separately for the branch activities and the inspection work. The total costs for wages and remunerations in 1999 amounted to SEK 25.5 million, of which SEK 12.5 million (i.e. about 49%) were attributed to the inspection work. The total amount of pension payments was SEK 6.9 million, of which SEK 6.346 million (or about 92%) were a burden on the latter activities. The remaining costs, including offices, travels, administration and social contributions, totalled SEK 28 million, of which SEK 12.7 million (about 45%) were attributed to the inspection work.\n31. In submissions by the Building Workers\u2019 Union to the Labour Court and by the Government in the present proceedings, it has been claimed that the result of the inspection work has to be corrected to the extent that a reimbursement was received from the pension fund of the Building Workers\u2019 Union. In the statement of accounts for 1999, a reimbursement of SEK 6.360 million was recorded for the inspection work. As this reimbursement in effect reduced the costs, the amount has to be deducted from the recorded profit of SEK 5 million in order to arrive at the real financial result of the inspection work. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the pension payments should be recorded as a cost, whereas the pension fund reimbursement should not be considered as revenue. Consequently, in 1999, that sector of activity was actually run at a loss of more than SEK 1.3 million.\nThe applicants, however, disagree with the above calculation. They have stated that, throughout the years, the branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union have made contributions to the pension fund, whose accumulated assets are used to honour the Union\u2019s pension commitments towards its retired personnel. Thus, when making pension payments, the Union branches are not the actual payer but are making the payments on behalf of the pension fund, presumably because the fund does not have an administrative division of its own to handle such payments. Accordingly, the applicants claim that, when determining the actual annual result of the inspection work, the pension transactions should only be taken into account to the extent that the fund reimbursements differ from the pension payments. In 1999, the reimbursement received by Byggettan exceeded the pension payments by as little as SEK 14,000. The financial result of that year should thus be reduced by only that amount and the recorded profit of SEK 5 million consequently remains virtually unchanged.\nIn the statements of accounts of the Building Workers Union\u2019s Gothenburg branch for the years 1997-2000, pension fund reimbursements have been recorded as revenue and pension payments as costs. Consequently, only the differences between reimbursements and payments have affected the annual results.\n32. The statements of accounts in the annual reports of Byggettan for 1997, 1998 and 2000 contain figures which give a picture similar to 1999. In 1997, the revenue from the inspection work was SEK 27.9 million (of which the monitoring fees came to SEK 17.3 million) and the recorded profit of that sector of activity amounted to SEK 3.4 million. Byggettan received a pension fund reimbursement of more than SEK 8.3 million. If the result is corrected with this amount, in the manner claimed by the Government, the profit would turn into a loss of SEK 4.9 million. However, the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 1.7 million. If pension transactions were altogether excluded from the calculation, as effectively suggested by the applicants, the profit would be halved and amount to SEK 1.7 million. 45% of the wage costs, 92% of the pension payments and 42% of the other costs of that year were attributed to the inspection work.\n33. In 1998, the inspection work revenue was SEK 28.8 million (of which the monitoring fees amounted to SEK 19.8 million) and the recorded profit was SEK 3.5 million. A pension fund reimbursement of SEK 6.8 million was received which, if allowed to correct the result in full, would change the latter into a loss of SEK 3.3 million. However, as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 14,000, the profit would remain at SEK 3.5 million if pension transactions were not taken into account. 46% of the wage costs, 93% of the pension payments and 44% of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work.\n34. In 2000, the inspection work revenue was SEK 37 million (of which the monitoring fees came to SEK 27.2 million) and the recorded profit was SEK 8.5 million. A pension fund reimbursement of SEK 6.4 million was received which, if correcting the result, would reduce the profit to SEK 2.1 million. However, as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 315,000, the profit would be SEK 8.2 million if pension transactions were not taken into account. 53% of the wage costs, 93% of the pension payments and 51% of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work.\n##### 2. The annual budgets of Byggettan\n35. The budgets for 1998 and 2000-2003 have been made available to the Court by the parties.\n36. In its budget for 1998, Byggettan estimated that the monitoring work would cost SEK 3.9 million and that the direct costs of the inspection unit (dealing with both monitoring of time-based wages and measuring of piecework) would amount to SEK 12 million. The projected revenue from the inspection work was SEK 29 million. It thus appears that the costs of the monitoring work accounted for about one-third of the inspection costs. However, as can be seen from the above-mentioned figures presented in the annual report for 1998 (see paragraph 33 above), the monitoring fees\u2019 share of the inspection revenue came to more than two-thirds (SEK 19.8 million out of a recorded total of SEK 28.8 million). That share was approximately the same in 1997, 1999 and 2000.\n37. The budgets for 2000-2003 give the estimated total costs of the various units of Byggettan. In 2000, the total projected costs of all sectors of activity were SEK 69.4 million. The monitoring unit had a budget of SEK 6.1. million and the wages and contracts unit (the largest unit of Byggettan, which, according to the description in the budget, was dealing with, inter alia, the measurement of piecework, wage negotiations and matters concerning workers\u2019 co-determination, the work environment and safety) had a budget of SEK 18.1 million. It is not possible to discern, from the material available to the Court, how much of the latter unit\u2019s budgeted costs related to the measuring work. Furthermore, as an unknown portion of Byggettan\u2019s general administrative costs would presumably have to be attributed to monitoring and measuring, the total budgeted costs for the two types of inspection work cannot be established.\nHowever, the costs of the inspection work according to the official results for 2000 appear to be considerably higher than the budgeted costs for that activity. Thus, the statement of accounts for that year attributes SEK 28.5 million in operational and administrative costs and write-offs to the inspection work, which corresponds to about 52% of the grand total of SEK 54.8 million. If, as claimed by the Government, an amount corresponding to that year\u2019s pension fund reimbursement is to be added as an actual cost, the official costs attributed to the inspection work rise to 57% of the total costs.\n38. In the budget for 2001, the projected total costs of Byggettan were SEK 73.5 million, while those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages and contracts unit were SEK 6.3 million and 19.6 million, respectively. The 2002 budget estimated the total costs at SEK 73.1 million. Both the monitoring unit and the new wages unit (responsible, inter alia, for measuring work) had a budget of SEK 7.2 million. In 2003, the budgeted total costs were SEK 77.8 million and those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages unit were SEK 7.1 million and 8.6 million, respectively.\n3. The financial results of inspection work performed by all branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union in the years 2001-2005\n39. A chart compiled by Mr Leif Hjelm, Deputy Head of Finance at the Union, and submitted to the Court by the Government, contains the results of the monitoring and measuring activities of all 34 branches of the Union. According to the chart, Byggettan recorded a positive result in four out of the five years presented and had an accumulated profit of SEK 36.2 million during the period. If corrected with the reimbursements received from the pension fund, the accumulated profit would amount to SEK 21.8 million. However, the chart shows a negative overall result for 26 of the branches. As a consequence, the accumulated five-year result of the inspection work of all the branches of the Union was a loss of SEK 5 million, or \u2013 if the result is corrected with the contributions made by the branches to the pension fund and the reimbursements received from that fund during the period \u2013 a loss of SEK 58 million.\nIt should be noted that the chart in question does not provide any information on the actual pension payments made by the Union branches, nor how the annual costs had been assigned between the inspection work and the branches\u2019 other activities. The statements of accounts of the Gothenburg branch for the years 1997-2000 show, however, that that branch allocated the costs in much the same way as Byggettan.\n##### 4. Statement by Mr Rolf Andersson, treasurer at Byggettan\n40. In a statement of 23 February 2005, made in regard to the present case and submitted to the Court by the Government, Mr Rolf Andersson gave the following information on the monitoring activities of Byggettan in 1999. A total of about SEK 9.4 million was deducted from the wages of workers working for employers bound by the Construction Agreement. The total costs of the monitoring work were approximately SEK 16.4 million. A large part of the costs was financed by the employers themselves and not by means of deductions from workers\u2019 wages.\n##### 5. Statement by Mr Hans Tilly, president of the Building Workers\u2019 Union\n41. In the Union\u2019s periodical, Byggnadsarbetaren, issue no. 8/2006 (published on 18 May 2006), Mr Hans Tilly stated that the Union had a relatively low membership fee compared to other major trade unions because the monitoring and measuring fees bore the cost of the organisation of negotiations.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n42. The applicants asserted that the levying of the monitoring fees on their wages had amounted to a violation of their property rights. They relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The applicants\n43. The applicants submitted that the situation in the present case was to be examined under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as the wage deductions involved a deprivation of their property for a service which they had never requested and which, as regards the greater part of the deductions, did not correspond to any service at all. Whichever rule of Article 1 was applicable, there had been an interference with their property rights which lacked a legitimate aim and which, in any event, was not proportionate to any such aim.\n44. As to the proportionality of the alleged interference, the applicants submitted, inter alia, the following. The monitoring fees constituted covert union membership fees. That conclusion followed already from the judgment of the Labour Court, which had stated that there was no reason to distinguish between monitoring work and general union activities and that the monitoring fees contributed financially to those general activities. Through the payment of those fees, the applicants came to support the Union\u2019s political and ideological programme with which they did not agree. Moreover, the monitoring system was unique to the Building Workers\u2019 Union and could not be seen as an indispensable tool for the proper functioning of the Union on the labour market. In balancing the interests involved, the applicants\u2019 interests thus weighed more heavily. Further, in so far as the monitoring work generated a surplus, a legitimate union interest was lacking altogether and a balancing exercise was irrelevant.\n45. Referring to the documents submitted to the Court, including the annual reports and budgets of Byggettan, the applicants claimed that the monitoring work generated a substantial annual surplus. This could be seen already from the official results in the annual reports. The Union\u2019s and the Government\u2019s claim, that the actual results were negative as amounts corresponding to the pension fund reimbursements had to be added to the costs for each year, was repudiated by the applicants; only the difference between reimbursements and actual pension payments affected the results, which thus remained positive. The applicants also questioned the allocation of costs made by Byggettan and other branches of the Union; despite the fact that only a small number of employees were involved in monitoring and measuring work \u2013 the majority of staff being occupied with branch activities \u2013 more than 90% of the pension payments and about half of the wage costs were allocated to the monitoring and measuring work. It was the applicants\u2019 opinion that this had been done because of the fact that the costs of wages attributed to the business activities were tax deductible. They also pointed out that the results forecasted in the budgets were far better than the results recorded in the annual reports and that these \u201cnegative budget deviations\u201d, i.e. miscalculations, continued year after year. In their view, the only possible conclusion was that the budgets more accurately indicated the true profits and that the results recorded in the annual reports were the effect of certain reallocations of costs.\nThe applicants further asserted that their submissions constituted sufficient evidence to conclude that the inspection work, in particular the monitoring activities, generated a surplus far exceeding the profits recorded in the annual reports of Byggettan. In these circumstances, the Government should bear the burden of proof for their claim that the Union\u2019s inspection work was run at a loss. To date, the Government had not presented adequate information allowing a full examination of the Union\u2019s revenue and costs in respect of the inspection work.\n46. As to the Government\u2019s contention that all construction workers benefited from the wage monitoring, the applicants submitted that it was the wish of the Union that collective agreements have strong normative effects and that there was always a risk for the Union that its work, to a greater or lesser extent, benefited non-members. They also maintained that unorganised workers did not receive any help from the Union if a fault was discovered during the wage monitoring. Moreover, while, formally, the Union was entitled to compensation only if monitoring work actually had been carried out, it had never, in practice, declined to receive any monitoring fees.\n47. The applicants finally submitted that it was the system of collective agreements with normative effect, regulated by law, which had made possible the alleged violations of their rights. The Swedish State, therefore, had had a positive obligation to protect their rights in relation to the Union.\n##### 2. The Government\n48. The Government contended that, if Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was at all applicable, what had occurred in the present case had to be considered as a control of the use of property falling within the scope of its second paragraph. They left it to the Court to decide whether an interference giving rise to State responsibility had occurred. They submitted, however, that the alleged interference had been lawful. Furthermore, the wage monitoring system that followed from the Construction Agreement, and the costs to which the applicants were compelled to contribute, served not only the legitimate aim of protecting the rights and freedoms of others, but also pursued the general interest of the community, namely to uphold the legitimacy of the Swedish approach in the area of industrial relations.\n49. The Government further maintained that the alleged interference under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been proportionate to the aim pursued. In support of that contention they submitted, inter alia, the following. In general, the assessment of proportionality had to be made in the light of the importance attributed in Sweden to the system of collective bargaining. The collective agreements had an important normative effect and protected workers\u2019 interests in a general sense. In the construction business, employees who were not members of the Union also benefited from the latter\u2019s negotiations with the Industries concerning, for instance, wage levels, although they did not contribute financially to this part of the Union\u2019s activities, which was financed by means of membership fees. As wage monitoring ensured that the collective agreement was adhered to by the employers, it fulfilled an important function in the interests of construction workers generally. There was no difference in treatment between Union members and other workers; Byggettan would also inform non-unionised workers and contact their employers in case any discrepancies were found. In this respect, the Government referred the statement by Mr Bromander, according to which, in 1999, wages had been adjusted upwards for 250 non-unionised workers as a result of the monitoring work (paragraph 26 above). The Government asserted that, if non-unionised workers were exempt from contributing to the wage monitoring system, it would appear to be at the expense of the Union\u2019s members, who would presumably have to contribute more to help cover the costs of the monitoring work.\n50. The Government also adduced that it was an essential trade union interest, as such, to ensure that the wage clauses of the Construction Agreement were adhered to. The wage monitoring system had a preventive impact in the sense that employers, being aware of the fact that deviations from the Construction Agreement would probably not go unnoticed, presumably would take more care in respecting the wage levels specified by the agreement. Due to the short duration of their employment periods and their resultant difficulties in being informed of the applicable collective agreement, this effect was particularly vital for construction workers. Furthermore, Byggettan was only entitled to compensation if monitoring work had actually been carried out and only the actual costs of monitoring were to be covered by the fees. According to the treasurer at Byggettan, during the relevant year 1999, the overall costs for wage monitoring had exceeded the total amount which had been deducted from the wages of workers employed by an employer bound by the Construction Agreement. This indicated that the applicants had not contributed to Byggettan\u2019s branch activities by means of the deductions made to their wages. Further, in the Government\u2019s opinion, the applicants had provided no direct evidence to establish that any such contribution had occurred. Moreover, according to the Union, its business activities, including wage monitoring, were strictly separated, financially, from the branch activities. Thus, the monitoring fees provided financial support only to the monitoring work, which aimed to verify compliance with the collective agreement\u2019s provisions on wages. The fees should therefore be viewed as payment for a service which \u2013 as a consequence of the legal framework governing the labour market in Sweden \u2013 was provided by the Union rather than the State. The Government further pointed out that the amounts deducted from the applicants\u2019 wages were relatively limited.\n51. With respect to the results of the wage monitoring activities, the Government submitted that the use of a standard fee of 1.5% of the wages necessarily meant that the precise outcome of the monitoring work might vary between different years and between the local branches of the Union. However, according to the information provided to the Government by the Union, the majority of local branches showed neither significant profits nor losses from their monitoring work. As regards the documents made available to the Court, the Union\u2019s position was that the profits from the monitoring and measuring activities of Byggettan, as shown in its annual reports for the years 1997-2000, did not reflect the real results, as money from the Union\u2019s pension fund had been used to cover part of the costs. Instead, when the effects of these pension fund reimbursements had been taken into account, the monitoring and measuring activities of Byggettan showed a loss in the first three years and a profit for the year 2000 of only SEK 2.1 million, rather than the profit of SEK 8.5 million recorded in the annual report. Furthermore, the chart compiled by the Union for the years 2001-2005 showed that, whether or not pension fund reimbursements were taken into account, the accumulated result of the monitoring and measuring activities of all the Union branches was a negative one. In this connection, the Government asserted that a fair examination required that not only the situation of one local branch was taken into account. The Government maintained, however, that they were entirely depending on information provided by the Union and were not in a position to assess whether the Union\u2019s analysis of the matter was economically correct.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Whether there has been an interference\n52. The Court notes that, in accordance with the rules of the Construction Agreement, deductions of 1.5% on the applicants\u2019 wages were made to cover the monitoring fee. The Court finds that these deductions deprived the applicants of their possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n##### 2. Purpose and lawfulness of the interference\n53. It must therefore be determined whether this deprivation pursued a legitimate aim \u201cin the public interest\u201d and was \u201csubject to the conditions provided for by law\u201d within the meaning of the second rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n54. The Court reiterates that a deprivation of property effected in pursuance of legitimate social, economic or other policies may be \u201cin the public interest\u201d even if the community at large derives no direct benefit from that deprivation (see James and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 31-32, \u00a7 45). Having regard to the wider context of the case, namely the fact that, in Sweden, it has been left to the parties on the labour market to regulate wages and various other work conditions through collective agreements and that there is no State authority overseeing compliance with these agreements, the Court accepts that the levying on workers\u2019 wages of a fee to cover the costs of the Union\u2019s inspection work, as such, can be considered to pursue a legitimate aim \u201cin the public interest\u201d, as the inspection work aims to protect the interests of construction workers generally. It further notes that it is not in dispute between the parties of the present case that this scheme was in accordance with Swedish law.\n##### 3. Proportionality of the interference\n55. An interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions must strike a fair balance between the demands of the general interests of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. The concern to achieve this balance is reflected in the structure of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a whole. The requisite balance will not be found if the person concerned has had to bear an individual and excessive burden (see, among other authorities, Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 26 and 28, \u00a7\u00a7 69 and 73). In other words, there must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised (see, for instance, James and Others, cited above, p. 34, \u00a7 50).\n56. As to the facts of the present case, the Court notes that approximately 30 euros were deducted monthly from the applicants\u2019 wages during their five-month employment with the company in order to reimburse Byggettan for its costs relating to the monitoring of building workers\u2019 wages in the Stockholm region. The applicants have claimed that they, as unorganised workers, would not have received any help from Byggettan if faults had been discovered in the course of the wage monitoring. The Court accepts, however, the information given by Mr Bromander in his statement of 24 May 2006 that, in 1999, 250 unorganised workers had had their wages adjusted upwards as a result of Byggettan\u2019s monitoring activities (paragraph 26 above). As concluded by the Labour Court in its judgment of 7 March 2001 (paragraph 15 above), it thus appears that the applicants received a certain service in return for the fee paid.\n57. The Court further notes that the Construction Agreement stipulates that the fees which construction workers are compelled to pay for the monitoring of time-based wages and measuring of piecework and result work are to cover the costs pertaining to those inspection activities. The fees should not be used as a contribution towards the Union\u2019s branch activities. Moreover, the business activities, i.e. the inspection work, of Byggettan and other branches of the Union, are accounted for separately from the branch activities.\n58. Nevertheless, the Court has taken into consideration the financial information submitted in regard to the activities carried out by Byggettan. It notes that, whereas less than one-fourth of its officials appear to have been involved in inspection work, the statement of accounts for the years 1997-2000, included in the annual reports, attributed more than 90% of the pension payments and almost half of the costs for wages, remunerations and other expenses to the inspection work. The Government have not commented on this fact and the annual reports of Byggettan do not provide any explanation for the allocation of costs between its business and branch activities. Whereas no information is available to the Court as to the allocation of costs for the Union as a whole, the statement of accounts of the Gothenburg branch for the same period show that it allocated the costs in the same manner as Byggettan. Noting that the matter at issue in the present case is the fees imposed for the monitoring of time-based wages, the Court observes that these statements of accounts do not differentiate between the costs of the monitoring work and those pertaining to the measuring activities.\nThe Court further notes that the annual reports of Byggettan and the Gothenburg branch for 1997-2000 all recorded profits from the inspection work, despite the rather high costs attributed to that sector of activity. It is true that the results in several of these years would be negative if, as claimed by the Union, the amounts reimbursed by the pension fund would be added to the costs of the inspection work. The Court, however, accepts the applicants\u2019 view that, in order to arrive at correct annual results, the reimbursements should only be taken into account to the extent that they exceeded the actual pension payments made by the Union branches. The recorded profits remain largely unchanged if this excess is taken into account.\n59. In estimating the financial results of the inspection work, the budgets of Byggettan, naturally, provide less reliable information than the annual reports. This is even more so as it is not entirely clear which units of Byggettan were involved, directly or indirectly, in the monitoring and measuring activities. Nevertheless, even a very careful analysis would appear to show that the budgeted costs of the inspection work were considerably lower than the costs attributed to these activities in the annual reports. No explanation has been forthcoming from the Government, or the Union, as to the difference between these figures or to the fact that the difference remained year after year.\n60. However, the Government have presented a chart compiled by the Union for the years 2001-2005, which indicates an accumulated loss of SEK 5 million for the inspection work of all the branches of the Union taken together. Still, as the chart does not specify the revenue and costs of the various branches or the allocation of costs between the business and branch activities, it does not provide a basis for an analysis of the financial results of the inspection work in those years.\n61. The Court considers that, although the above-mentioned documents give certain indications, it cannot draw any completely reliable conclusion from the available information as to whether profits have been made from the monitoring activities of Byggettan or the inspection work carried out by the Union branches as a whole. Moreover, it cannot be ascertained whether a possible surplus generated by the inspection work has been used to cover part of the costs relating to the Union\u2019s branch activities, i.e., inter alia, wage negotiations, union agitation and political work. It notes, however, the statement made by the Union president, Mr Tilly, that the monitoring and measuring fees carry the costs of the negotiation organisation (paragraph 41 above).\n62. Even so, the Court finds that the absence of full information enabling a reliable examination of the results of the Union\u2019s inspection work and the actual use of the money received for that work raises an issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. As has been noted above, the monitoring fees deducted from the applicants\u2019 wages constituted payment for a service provided by Byggettan. In accordance with the Construction Agreement, only the actual cost of monitoring was to be covered by the fees. In these circumstances, the applicants were entitled to information which was sufficiently exhaustive for them to verify that the fees corresponded to the actual cost of the inspection work and that the amounts paid were also not used for other purposes. This was even more important as they had to pay the fees against their will to an organisation with a political agenda which they did not support. However, neither the facts and figures presented in the annual reports and budgets of Byggettan, nor those contained in the submissions of the Union and the Government in the domestic and the present proceedings, can be considered to have been sufficient for that purpose.\n63. Moreover, while the respondent State has to be given a wide margin of appreciation in the organisation of its labour market, a system which, as in the present case, in reality delegates the power to legislate, or regulate, important labour issues to independent organisations acting on that market requires that these organisations are held accountable for their activities. This requirement was particularly significant in the present case, where the relevant labour market organisations had concluded a collective agreement whose effects also extended to unorganised workers, obliging them to contribute financially to a particular activity carried out by a trade union. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the State had a positive obligation to protect the applicants\u2019 interests.\n64. In conclusion, the Court considers that the Union\u2019s wage monitoring activities, as applied in the present case in the context of the Swedish system of collective bargaining, lacked the necessary transparency. Thus, even having regard to the limited amounts of money involved for the applicants, it was not proportionate to \u201cthe public interest\u201d in the case to make deductions to their wages without giving them a proper opportunity to check how that money was spent.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 9, 10, 11 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION\n65. The applicants also complained that the levying of the monitoring fees on their wages had violated their right to negative freedom of association under Article 11 of the Convention, since the fees had been tantamount to forced membership of the Union and had contributed to the general union activities. Moreover, under that Article, read in conjunction with Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, they claimed that, through the payment of the fees, they had come to support the Union\u2019s political and ideological programme. Finally, under Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 11 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, they asserted that they had been discriminated against in relation to members of the Union as well as members of other trade unions.\n66. The Government contested the applicants\u2019 allegations.\n67. In the light of its findings with regard to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (paragraph 64 above), the Court does not consider that a separate examination of the merits of the case under Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 is necessary.\n### III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n68. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n69. The applicants sought EUR 7,500 each for non-pecuniary damage, on account of anger, frustration and emotional distress caused by the events of the case.\n70. The Government did not contest that, should the Court conclude that a violation of the Convention had occurred, the applicants might be entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In view of the limited financial impact that the monitoring scheme had had upon the applicants, the Government found, however, their claims to be somewhat excessive. They left it to the Court to determine an award.\n71. The Court finds it appropriate to make an award for non-pecuniary damage. Ruling on an equitable basis, it awards each of the five applicants EUR 5,000 under that head.\n#### B. Costs and expenses\n72. The applicants claimed a total of SEK 1,012,500 (approximately EUR 112,000) in legal fees for the proceedings before the Court. This amount corresponded to 385 hours of work for the applicants\u2019 counsel Mr Bratt and Mr S\u00f6dergren, and 65 hours of work for Mr Herrlin, all at an hourly rate of SEK 2,250, inclusive of value-added tax (VAT). They further claimed SEK 20,000 for an expert opinion given by Mr Eskil Qwerin, an accountant. Finally, they claimed SEK 28,513.50 for travel and accommodation expenses incurred in attending the Court\u2019s hearing in the case.\n73. The Government did not question the number of hours worked by the applicants\u2019 counsel. With regard to the work of Mr Herrlin, they pointed out that he is the head of the lawyers\u2019 section of the Industries, the sixth applicant in the case whose complaints had been declared inadmissible by the Court\u2019s decision of 28 March 2006. They could therefore accept the claim for compensation for his work only in so far as it had been undertaken to assist Mr Bratt and Mr S\u00f6dergren in representing the five remaining applicants. Bearing in mind that the hourly rate applied within the Swedish legal-aid system was SEK 1,286, including VAT, the Government further considered that the hourly rate applied for the legal work was unduly high. Instead, they could accept an hourly rate of SEK 1,800, including VAT. They also found the sum concerning the expert opinion to be excessive, considering no more than half that sum to be appropriate. The Government, however, accepted the amount claimed for expenses incurred in connection with the Court\u2019s hearing.\n74. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, an applicant is entitled to reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and were reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the Court finds the views expressed by the Government to be reasonable. It awards the applicants, jointly, compensation of EUR 77,000 (corresponding to 385 hours at an hourly rate of SEK 1,800) for the work carried out by Mr Bratt and Mr S\u00f6dergren, EUR 6,500 (corresponding to half the hours claimed at an hourly rate of SEK 1,800) for the work undertaken by Mr Herrlin, and EUR 1,100 for the expert opinion given by Mr Qwerin. The expenses incurred in connection with the Court\u2019s hearing, approximately EUR 3,200, are to be compensated in full. In total, therefore, the Court awards the applicants, by way of costs and expenses, EUR 87,800.\n#### C. Default interest\n75. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention;\n2. Holds that it is unnecessary to examine the merits of the remainder of the applicants\u2019 complaints;\n##### 3. Holds\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Swedish kronor at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:\n(i) EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) to each of the five applicants in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii) EUR 87,800 (eighty-seven thousand eight hundred euros) to the applicants jointly in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii) any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n4. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 13 February 2007, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\nS. Doll\u00e9 A.B. Baka\nRegistrar President\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the concurring opinion of Ms Fura-Sandstr\u00f6m is annexed to this judgment.\n#### A.B. B.\nS. D.\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE FURA-SANDSTR\u00d6M\nAfter some hesitation I voted with the majority in finding a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 although I would have preferred to have the case examined under Article 11 of the Convention for the following reasons:\nHaving reached the conclusion that the right to negative freedom of association under the Convention is weaker than the positive right, the Labour Court in its judgment of 7 March 2001 put the emphasis on the undisputed fact that the applicants were never under pressure or forced to join the Union. Hence there was no violation of their negative freedom of association, which under domestic law is exclusively based on the Convention. Referring to the European Court\u2019s case-law, the Labour Court considered that only the core of the negative freedom of association was protected under Article 11, meaning that a person must have been subjected to a certain measure of force or at least strong pressure to join an organisation in order to give rise to a violation of that Article (see paragraph 15 of the judgment). Assuming that the Court\u2019s case-law on the negative freedom of association can be interpreted in this way, it might be fair to describe it as somewhat undeveloped and conservative to date. Perhaps this case was not the appropriate one for developing the case-law further to include other situations than those where actual force or strong pressure had been exercised.\nThe applicants claim, among other things, that they cannot see where their money has gone. The lack of transparency of the accounts and other reports from Byggettan leads them to suspect that the fees levied on their wages might have been contributing to the general activities of \u201can organisation with a political agenda which they did not support\u201d (see paragraph 62 of the judgment, my emphasis), which they find contrary to their rights under Article 11. Having regard to the financial information made available concerning the Union\u2019s monitoring work, I find that the applicants\u2019 suspicions in this respect were justified. Using the same reasoning as the national court, I find that the complaint falls within the ambit of Article 11 and, contrary to the national court, that there was a violation, since the Government failed in their positive obligation to protect the interests of the applicants (see paragraph 63 of the judgment). Taking this approach it would not have been necessary to examine the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which in my opinion would have been a more satisfactory line of reasoning, especially in view of the relatively small sum levied, in all about 160 euros per applicant."}
