THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, in 1974 the applicant had not been the owner of any property located in northern Cyprus. Nor was he, according to the same source, the owner of any property at the present time. Given that in 1974 the applicant had had no right or interest in relation to the properties at issue, no question of a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could arise. Even assuming that the applicant had acquired the properties in question in 1990, this would have happened sixteen years after the events of 1974 and three years after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. Therefore, he should have known that access to the properties was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it.\n13. In the light of the above, the Government argued that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n14. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points. Administrative and judicial remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were therefore accessible to them.\n15. Law no. 49/2003 provided for the establishment of an independent Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission with jurisdiction to award compensation for Greek-Cypriot immovable properties in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, on the basis of the market value on 20 July 1974, plus compensation for the loss of use, loss of income and increases in the value of property. The decisions of this Commission could be appealed to the High Administrative Court. Given the existence of this remedy, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### B. The applicant\u2019s arguments\n16. The applicant observed that his parents had been the lawful owners of the properties in question in 1974. The Government could have ascertained this by consulting the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d. There had been the expectation that the applicant and his sister would, in due course, become the registered owners. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive the applicant\u2019s parents of their title (see Loizidou v. Turkey, (merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The applicant had become the legal owner of the properties on 20 April 1990 and this fact had been recorded by the official authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The donation could not have been recorded by the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d because the authorities of the \u201cTRNC\u201d considered that the properties had already been expropriated. The Government could not rely on the records of the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d ", "001-79346": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF WASSDAHL v.

Disability benefits\n20. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1987 and 1996, when the applicant made his applications to the Office, this corresponded to 6,868 and 10,317 Swedish kronor (SEK), respectively.\n#### B. Procedure\n21. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Appeals may be made against the Office\u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act.\n22. The latter provision enables the Office to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision, provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court.

Under Scots law, a witness who has been present in court without the court\u2019s permission and without consent from the opposite party may still be allowed to give evidence provided that \u201cit appears to the court that the presence of the witness was not the result of culpable negligence or criminal intent, and that the witness had not been unduly instructed or influenced by what took place during his presence, or that injustice will not be done by his examination\u201c (section 140 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c).\n#### B. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n18. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n19.

In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act).

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n16. Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n17. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n18. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n19. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:\n\u201c353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\nA fresh claim, if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of State, and if refused, gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits. If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim, their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim.\n#### B. Relevant case-law\n20. In J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n21. The Court of Appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test. It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts). At the hearing in the present case, the Government indicated that there were on that date 56 prisoners serving whole life sentences. No prisoner in this category has been released since the date of the Vinter judgment.\n#### A. The Human Rights Act 1998\n14. The Human Rights Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201cSection 2 - Interpretation of Convention rights.\n(1) A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any\u2014\n(a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights,\n...\nSection 3 - Interpretation of legislation.\n(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\n...\nSection 6 - Acts of public authorities.\n(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\u2014\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\n(3) In this section \u201cpublic authority\u201d includes\u2014\n(a) a court or tribunal, and\n(b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,\nbut does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.\n...\nSection 7 - Proceedings.\n(1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may\u2014\n(a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or\n(b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,\nbut only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.\n...\nSection 8 - Judicial remedies.\n(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\n...\u201d\n#### B. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997\n15. Section 30 of the Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\u201d\n#### C. Prison Service Order 4700\n16. The policy of the Secretary of State for Justice on the exercise of the power of release on compassionate grounds is set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued as Prison Service Order 4700. The criteria, as formulated in April 2010, provide as follows:\n\u201cthe prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stoke;\nand\nthe risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\nfurther imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\nthere are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\nearly release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family\u201d.\n#### D. Court of Appeal decision in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin\n17. A special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear these appeals, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge. It gave its decision (\u201cMcLoughlin\u201d) on 18 February 2014, in light of the judgment of this Court in the Vinter case.\n18. The appellant Newell challenged as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention the whole life order imposed on him for a murder committed while he was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder. The McLoughlin case took the form of a reference by the Attorney General under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1986, who contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The trial judge had instead imposed a life sentence with a tariff of forty years for a murder committed by a man with previous convictions for murder and manslaughter.\n19. In its decision, the Court of Appeal traced the development of the whole life sentence and the review of such sentences. It stated at paragraph 7 (citations omitted):\n\u201ci) On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (...).\n\u201cIn addition, I have decided that for those life sentence prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by their remaining in prison for the whole of their life, there will in future be an additional ministerial review when the prisoner has been in custody for 25 years. The purpose of this review will be solely to consider whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a tariff of a determinate period. The review will be confined to the considerations of retribution and deterrence. Where appropriate, further ministerial reviews will normally take place at five-yearly intervals thereafter. Existing prisoners who fall into this category and who have already served 25 years or more in custody will not be disadvantaged. Their cases will be reviewed by ministers as soon as is practicable and after any representations they may wish to make.\u201d\nii) That policy was modified by a different Home Secretary on 10 November 1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written answer):\n\u201cSo far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.\u201d\niii) In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley [...] that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was unlawful, this had been corrected by the 1997 policy which permitted the taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison. In the appeal to the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of exceptional circumstances (...) Lord Steyn, when approving the legality of the Home Secretary\u2019s 1997 policy, recorded the way in which the policy had been clarified (...):\n\u201c.... counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the policy of imposing a whole life tariff merely involves the expression of the current view of the Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution and deterrence make it inappropriate ever to release such a prisoner. It does not rule out reconsideration. The Secretary of State envisages the possibility of release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of State is prepared to reconsider any whole life tariff decision from time to time.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal then set out the relevant criteria of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), commenting that these were \u201chighly restrictive\u201d (paragraph 11 of the McLoughlin decision). It raised the question whether the statutory scheme was compatible with Article 3. In answering the question, it stated:\n\u201c(b) Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life order is imposed?\n19. The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self-evident, that there is no violation of Article 3 if a prisoner in fact spends the whole of his life in prison. One example is an offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life.\n20. However, the Grand Chamber considered that the justification for detention might shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might cease to be just after the passage of many years. It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of its judgment that for a life sentence to be compatible with Article 3, there must therefore be both a prospect of release and a possibility of review. It added at paragraph 122:\n\u201cA whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d\n21. It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124:\n\u201cHowever, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.\u201d\n22. Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a whole life order as just punishment, it concluded that a legal regime for a review during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed.\n23. Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the Strasbourg Court did not determine that the imposition of a whole life tariff itself violates Article 3, we return briefly to the arguments advanced contingently on the hypothesis that it did. In our judgment section 3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs. That is because section 269(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion that no order for early release should be made because of the seriousness of the offence alone or in combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply. That being so, section 6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public authority to act compatibly with the Convention.\n24. The only remedy available in the domestic courts on this hypothesis would be a declaration of incompatibility, the discretionary remedy available under section 4 of the Human Rights Act when primary legislation is found to be incompatible with the Convention. Such a remedy is not available in the Crown Court and would not, in any event, affect the continuing operation of the statutory scheme.\n(c) Is the regime under section 30 a regime for reducibility which is in fact compliant with Article 3?\n25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of section", "001-95382": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ER v.

The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all relevant domestic remedies as required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that neither at the appellate nor at the cassation stage had the applicant alleged, even in substance, any infringement of his right to a fair hearing as presented in his subsequent complaint to the Court.

The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. Had the applicant been of the opinion that the legal provisions on which the courts had based their decisions or their interpretation \u2013 namely Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in conjunction with section 52 \u00a7 2 of the Lustration Act \u2013 had breached his rights, in particular his right to a fair hearing enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution, he should have lodged a constitutional complaint.

The Government further submitted that the application had been lodged outside the time-limit of six months as the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case had been given on 1 February 2007 while he had lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007.\n17.

Disability benefits\n12. According to Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act (as in force until 1 January 2001, when the 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance - lagen (1998:703) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force), a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1997 the basic amount was SEK 36,300. In 1983, when the applicant turned 65, it was SEK 19,400.\n13. According to Chapter 9, section 3 of the 1962 Act (as in force at the material time), such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount, depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability.\n#### B. Procedure\n14. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act could form the subject of an appeal to the County Administrative Court, to the Administrative Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n15. The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings shall be in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing (I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas, om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det)\u201d.\nUnder those circumstan", "001-114240": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF REDFEARN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Employment Rights Act 1996\n23. Under section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer. By section 98(1), an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section 98(2), which includes \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201csome other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held\u201d.\nSection 98(4) deals with fairness:\n\u201cWhere the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection (1), the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to the reason shown by the employer) \u2013\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer\u2019s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.\u201d\n24. However, paragraph 106 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) Section 94 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than one year ending with the effective date of termination.\u201d\n25. Section 108(3) of the Employment Rights Act provides a wide variety of exceptions from the one-year qualifying period, many of which derive from the United Kingdom\u2019s implementation of European Community legislation in the field of employment. These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave, refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998, or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer. Moreover, applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race, sex or religion are also exempt from the one-year qualifying period.\n#### B. The Race Relations Act 1976\n26. Section 1 (1) (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 states the following:\n\u201cA person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-\n(a) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u201d\nSection 1 A of the Race Relations Act 1976 states:\n\u201c A person also discriminates against another if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection (IB), he applies to that other provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but\n(a) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons;\n(b) which puts that other at that disadvantage, and\n(c) which he cannot show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions concerning enforcement of payment of the community charge\n19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c).\nThe relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (\u201capplication for a liability order\u201c) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable.\n...\n(5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid.\u201c\nRegulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (\u201clevying of distress\u201c):\n\u201cWhere a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made.\u201c\nRegulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201c(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\n(2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.\n(3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit -\n(a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or\n(b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of the warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.\n...\n(7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ...\u201c\nThe relevant part of Regulation 42 provides:\n(3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed.\u201c\n20. In Regina v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9 October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that \u201cThe proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax.\u201c However, in Regina v. Hebburn Justices, ex parte Martin (31 July 1995, unreported), Mr Justice Sedley in the High Court held that although the initial obligation to pay community charge was a civil one, magistrates \u201cwho have reached the point of committal are entertaining a criminal process\u201c.\n#### B. Appeal from a decision of a magistrates' court by way of case stated\n21. By virtue of section 111 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 a party to proceedings before a magistrates' court may \u201cquestion the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ...\u201c. This is known as the \u201ccase stated\u201c procedure.\n22.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Unemployment benefits\n14. A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance. The main regulations in this area are given in the Unemployment Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets-f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, SFS 1997:238; hereafter \u201cthe 1997 Act\u201c) and the Unemployment Funds Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor, SFS 1997:239). Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and State funding. A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit, a so-called basic insurance. Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment, that is he or she has worked a certain number of months before becoming unemployed, and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions, for example, he or she must actively be looking for work. At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of days. After that, a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits.\n15. According to Section 45(a) of the 1997 Act, the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary, without acceptable reasons, rejects suitable work or if he or she, without having expressly rejected the work, by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised. The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits. According to Section 46, the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme (arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program). Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in the 1997 Act can be appealed against to the administrative courts.\n#### B. The activity guarantee scheme and activity support\n16. The activity guarantee scheme was one of several different labour market policy programmes. The scheme ceased to be in force on 2 July 2007. According to Sections 8 and 21 of the 2000 Ordinance, a person could (the word \u201cmay\u201d (f\u00e5r) was used in the Ordinance) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was at least 20 years old, was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service. Section 6 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and, thus, an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective. Moreover, Section 7 stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy.\n17. A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits. His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support (f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d, SFS 1996:100). Section 23 of the 1997 Act stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining days of unemployment benefits. In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining days of unemployment benefits, \u201csince the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 54).\n18. The Ordinance on Activity Support stated that a person who took part in, inter alia, the activity guarantee scheme was entitled to economic support.

Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n17. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n18. A person who has been deported may apply to have the deportation order revoked. Paragraphs 390 to 392 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) provide that:\n\u201c390.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 25 May 1992, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His son, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s son can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Loukas Nicola (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n16. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that since July 1974 Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n18.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving regard to the observations of the parties,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n13. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by Section 47 of the Prison Act, 1952, which, in so far as material, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein...\u201d\n14. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n15. The long standing policy of the prison service, set out above in the letter of Secretary of State of 28 May 2003 was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 of age. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n16. They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The Government argued that the policy was justified: (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single parent families.\n17. The Court of Appeal considered, while the first reason did no more than restate the policy, the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy. In giving judgment for the court, Lord Phillips said (at paragraphs 44 ff):\n\u201c[The Secretary of State] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy. I agree. Penal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system.\nFurthermore, [the applicants\u2019] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201cjustified\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustified public concern\u201d. A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern...\n...

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, 9 July 2013.\n10. As regards the discretion of the Secretary of State for Justice to release a prisoner sentenced to a whole life order, section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201csection 30\u201d) provides that he may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds. The criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued by the Secretary of State as Prison Service Order 4700 in April 2010.\nChapter 12 of the Lifer Manual, where relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe criteria for compassionate release on medical grounds for all indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISP) are as follows:\n\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stroke;\nand\n\u2022 the risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\n\u2022 further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\n\u2022 there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\n\u2022 early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family.\u201d\n[underlining in the original]\n11. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State, as a public authority, is bound to act compatibly with the scheduled Convention rights, including Article 3. Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act, legislation is to be interpreted so far as it is possible to do so compatibly with the Convention.\n12. A summary of the existing domestic case-law relating to the compatibility of the whole life order scheme with Article 3 of the Convention, notably the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in R v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. National Insurance\n11. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory national insurance (\u201cNI\u201d) contributions into the National Insurance Fund (NIF). This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n12. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NI scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NI contributions fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paras. 25-26).\n13.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 September and 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance tax\n12. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person's property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 275,000 for transfers between 5 April 2005 and 5 April 2006; GBP 285,000 for transfers during the tax year 2006-2007; and GBP 300,000 for 2007-2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n13. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the tax-payer's election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (1984 Act, section 227(1)-(4)).\n14. Section 18(1) of the 1984 Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005, this exemption was extended to a deceased's \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d)\n15. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n16. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n17. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The 2004 Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering inter alia pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n18. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was passed in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had co-habited for at least 12 years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n19. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour Peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Caithlin [the Conservative Peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times\u2014at Second Reading and in Grand Committee\u2014and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, Liberal Democrat Peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith MP, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill\u2014granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible ", "001-85728": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SZULC v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The Secretary of State is responsible for the management of the prison system in England and Wales (Prison Act 1952, sections 1 and 4).\n23. Until November 2007 each prison was required to appoint a medical officer (Prison Act 1952, section 7(1)). The medical officer was a prison officer who had to be a registered medical practitioner (Prison Act 1952, section 4). This requirement was removed by section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007 which came into force on 1 November 2007. Prison health care is now generally integrated with, and commissioned by, the National Health Service (NHS).\n24. Section 47(1) of the Prison Act 1952 authorises the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of prisons and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein. Such rules are made by statutory instrument, laid before Parliament, and are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (Prison Act 1952, section 52(1) and the Criminal Justice Act 1967, section 66(4)).\n25. Prisoners are classified in accordance with directions of the Secretary of State (Prison Rules SI 1999/728 rule 7(1)). Prisoners are classified in accordance with PSO 0900. Paragraph 1.1.1 of PSO 0900 contains the definitions of the four categories of prisoner (A, B, C and D). Category A is applied to prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or the security of the State, no matter how unlikely that escape might be, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible. Category B is applied to prisoners for whom the very highest conditions of security are not necessary, but for whom escape must be made very difficult.\n26. Rule 34 of the Prison Rules is headed \u201cCommunications Generally\u201d It provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) Without prejudice to sections 6 and 19 of the Prison Act 1952 and except as provided by these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any person outside the prison, or such person with him, except", "001-58410": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF SMITH AND FORD v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Widow's Pensions 1925-2001\n15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30:\n\u201c[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance: 'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.\nThe secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons' and widows' pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at", "001-83335": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF STEFF v.

Section 1(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if on the date of the poll he is, inter alia, registered in the register of parliamentary electors for a constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Pursuant to section 4(1), a person is entitled to be registered if on the relevant date he is, inter alia, resident in the constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.\n##### 2.

A service declaration can be made by a person who is (a) a member of the forces, (b) employed in the service of the Crown in a post outside the United Kingdom of any prescribed class or description, (c) employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom, or (d) the spouse or civil partner of a person falling within categories (a), (b) or (c) above.\n9. Section 17 provides that where a person\u2019s service declaration is in force, he shall be regarded for the purposes of section 4 of the 1983 Act as a resident on the date of the declaration at the address specified in it (current or former address in the United Kingdom).\n##### 3. Provisions regarding overseas voters\n(a) Current legislation\n10. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 as amended (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d) provides that a person who is a British citizen is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if he qualifies as an overseas elector on the date on which he makes an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d (see paragraph 14 below). A person qualifies as an overseas elector if he is not resident in the United Kingdom and he satisfies one of the sets of conditions set out in the legislation.\n11. The relevant set of conditions for the purpose of the present case is set out in section 1(3):\n\u201cThe first set of conditions is that\u2014\n(a) he was included in a register of parliamentary electors in respect of an address at a place that is situated within the constituency concerned,\n(b) that entry in the register was made on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at that address,\n(c) that entry in the register was in force at any time falling within the period of 15 years ending immediately before the relevant date [i.e. the date on which the applicant makes a declaration under section 2], and\n(d) subsequent to that entry ceasing to have effect no entry was made in any register of parliamentary electors on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at any other address.\u201d\n12. Section 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to be registered pursuant to an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d in the constituency where he was last registered to vote or last resided and the registration officer concerned is satisfied that he qualifies as an overseas elector in respect of that constituency. Where the entitlement of a person to remain registered as an overseas voter terminates, the registration officer concerned shall remove that person\u2019s entry from the register (section 2(2)).\n13. Section 2(3) requires that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration state the date of the declaration, that the declarant is a British citizen, that the declarant is not resident in the United Kingdom, and the date on which he ceased to be so resident.\n14. Section 2(4) stipulates that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration must show which set of conditions in section 1 of the Act the declarant claims to satisfy and, in the case of the first set of conditions, specify the address in respect of which he was registered.\n(b) History to the current legislation\n15. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 Act, no British citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary, i.e. general, election in the United Kingdom, other than members of the armed forces or Crown servants.\n16. In 1982 a parliamentary committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee, published a report on the Representation of the People Acts which recommended that British citizens living in what were then Member States of the European Economic Community should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period. The Government\u2019s response to that report recommended a seven-year limit for all overseas voters, expressing the view that a person\u2019s links with the United Kingdom were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for as long as ten years.\n17. The 1985 Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to British citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous five years. The bill originally proposed a seven-year period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short. Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time-limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with the United Kingdom were also raised.\n18. The five-year period was extended to twenty years by virtue of section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1989. The bill which led to the Act was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time-limit to twenty-five years. During parliamentary debates, the Secretary of State acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut-off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who, although resident abroad for some time, had retained close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and those who had \u201ccut adrift\u201d from such links much earlier. Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views, with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum.\n19. Section 1 of the 1989 Act was subsequently repealed and replaced, with retention of the twenty-year period, by section 8 and Schedule 2 of the Representation of the People Act 2000.\n20. In September 1998 the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on Electoral Law and Administration. It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced. The relevant extract of its report reads:\n\u201c113. The Representation of the People Act 1985 introduced a right for British citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and European elections for up to five years following their move overseas. This period was increased to twenty years under the Representation of the People Act 1989. The peak year for actual registrations under the Act was in 1991 when 34,500 registered; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in 1997, when the total stood at 23,600, followed by a further fall in 1998 to 17,300. Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged as high as three million.\n114. It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote. Professor Blackburn argued that the system meant that \u2018an expatriate living hundreds or thousands of miles away, for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation, carrying memories of British politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live, can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019. Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrat representatives both suggested that 20 years was perhaps too long. Professor Blackburn suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the UK or to an intention to return.\n115. On the other hand, it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue. It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the UK and are those most likely to be planning to return. A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home. The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be low", "001-87512": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF GINNIFER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Land Code\n15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code.\n16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations.\n17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service.\n18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence.\n19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides:\n\u201cWhen using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...\u201d\nDisturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42.\nSpecial provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At the material time, following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, an applicant had a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cthe AIT\u201d). Section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as inserted by section 81(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004) provided that a party to an appeal to the AIT could apply for an order that the AIT reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law.\n28. Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted, an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) stated that:\n\u201cWhen a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\n29. Where a person was not granted leave to enter the United Kingdom, he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State also had power to deport any person who was not a British citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d.\n### III. RELEVANT EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n30. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (\u201cthe Qualification Directive\u201d) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n31. On 17 October 2007 the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) asking, inter alia, whether article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.\n32. The ECJ held that article 15(c) protection went beyond that of Article 3 of the Convention, which was covered by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive. The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows:\n\u201cArticle 15(c) of the Directive, in conjunction with article 2(e) of the Directive, must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country or as the case may be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.\u201d\n33. In QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 620 the Court of Appeal observed that the ECJ in Elgafaji had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality, but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article 15(c). A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article 15(c) where the level of violence was such that, without anything to render them a particular target, civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety.\n34. More recently, in the case of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat, whether permissible under the laws or not, that seriously endangered non-combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive.\n### IV. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n35. It is a well-established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country. This principle is reflected both in article 8 of the Qualification Directive and paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay.\n36. In the cases of Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords held that the decision-maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so. In this regard, the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality, including in his former place of habitual residence. If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation, judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally, and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there. However, the more closely the persecution was linked to the State, and the greater the control of the State over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf, the more likely (other things being equal) that a victim of persecution in one place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same State.\n### V. RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMALIA\n#### A. Factual background\n37. The factual background to the conflict in Somalia, as described in the country reports at paragraphs 80 \u2013 188 below and subsequently agreed by the parties, is as follows.\n38. Somalia is comprised of three autonomous areas: the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the north west, the state of Puntland in the north east, and the remaining southern and central regions. Somali society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families, which are subdivided into clans and sub-clans. The four majority clans are Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq and Dir. In addition there are a number of minority groups, which are also divided into sub-groups. The Digli and Mirifle take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups.\n39. Somalia has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President Siad Barre by opposing clans in 1991. The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness, civil conflict and clan warfare followed. Mogadishu was fragmented into rival, clan-based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords. The Transitional Federal Government was established in October 2004 but a combination of internal divisions within the Transitional Federal Government and insecurity in central and southern Somalia hindered it from becoming a functioning Government. In June 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts, a union of various Sharia courts, took control of Mogadishu. Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of most of central and southern Somalia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 (2006) authorised the deployment of an African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development force to protect the Transitional Federal Government. Ethiopian ground and air forces also moved into Somalia to support the Transitional Federal Government and by late December 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts had been ousted from Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. Remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops.\n40. After the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts, the semblance of order and security that it had created in Mogadishu deteriorated. Roadblocks and checkpoints returned, as did banditry and violence. Furthermore, attacks by anti-government elements on Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces continued in Mogadishu, with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting. Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced. The fall of the Union of Islamic Courts also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra-clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued.\n41. In 2007 the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia was created when Somali Islamists and opposition leaders joined forces to fight the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces.\n42. On 20 August 2008 the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia signed a ceasefire agreement in Djibouti. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, the Islamic insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement, and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia.\n43. By late 2008 Islamist insurgents, including a group called al\u2011Shabaab, had regained control of most of southern Somalia.\n44. Somalia\u2019s Parliament met in Djibouti in January 2009 and swore in 149 new members from the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. The Parliament also extended the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government for another two years and installed moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as the new President.\n45. Ethiopia pulled its troops out of Somalia in January 2009. Soon after, al-Shabaab took control of Baidoa, formerly a key stronghold of the Transitional Federal Government. In May 2009 Islamist insurgents launched an attack on Mogadishu, prompting President Ahmad to appeal for help from abroad.\n46. In October 2009 al-Shabaab consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival, Hizbul Islam, out of the southern port city of Kismayo. Since then it has openly declared its alliance with al-Qaeda and has been steadily moving forces up towards Mogadishu.\n47. In December 2010 Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab merged.\n#### B. Parties to the conflict\n##### 1. The Transitional Federal Government\n48. The Transitional Federal Government is recognised by the United Nations and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of Somalia. However, it currently controls only a small section of Mogadishu centred on the port, the airport and the presidential palace. It is largely dependent on African Union troops for its survival.\n##### 2. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\n49. AMISOM is an African Union force authorised by the UN Security Council and deployed to Mogadishu to support the Transitional Federal Government. It currently consists of 5,300 Ugandan and Burundian troops.\n##### 3. Ethiopian forces\n50. Ethiopian forces joined the conflict in 2006 to help drive out the Union of Islamic Courts. They remained in Somalia until their withdrawal at the beginning of 2009.\n##### 4. Al-Shabaab\n51. Al-Shabaab began as part of the armed wing of the Union of Islamic Courts. When the 2006 Ethiopian military intervention sent the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts into exile, a hard core of al-Shabaab fighters remained in Somalia to fight. In their April 2010 report, \u201cHarsh War, Harsh Peace\u201d, Human Rights Watch indicated that al-Shabaab was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity, but the group\u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda: defeating AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government and extending Sharia law across Somalia. Some of its leaders have links with al-Qaeda although the extent of al-Qaeda\u2019s influence over al-Shabaab remains unclear.\n52. Al-Shabaab has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground, especially in southern Somalia. They have received material support from the Eritrean government, which is eager to undercut Ethiopia\u2019s interests in the region. By the end of 2009 al-Shabaab controlled more territory than any other faction in Somalia, including Baidoa, the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament, Jowhar, which had been one of the Transitional Federal Government President\u2019s most reliable strongholds, and the strategic port of Kismayo.\n53. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala on 11 July 2010, which killed 79 people watching the World Cup soccer final on television. It was al-Shabaab\u2019s first attack outside Somalia and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond.\n##### 5. Hizbul Islam\n54. Hizbul Islam is another armed group which has both a Sharia agenda and the goal of driving AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government from Mogadishu. In early 2009 it entered into an alliance with al-Shabaab but the alliance came to an end in October 2009 during the fight for Kismayo. In December 2010, however, it once again merged with al\u2011Shabaab.\n##### 6. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca\n55. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca is an Islamist group which professes to support a more moderate agenda. The group exists primarily in central Somalia, where it has maintained control over large strips of territory, predominantly in Galgadud and Hiran regions.\n56. In February 2010 Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca signed a power-sharing and military unification pact with the Transitional Federal Government, although at times relations between the two groups were strained.\n### VI. RELEVANT CASE LAW\n#### A. NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076\n57. In NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076 the AIT found that conditions in southern Somalia and particularly in and around Mogadishu were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of Article 3 ill-treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them. Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection, although individual circumstances required separate consideration. Although women were at greater risk than men, they would not be able to show that, simply as lone female returnees from the United Kingdom, they had no place of clan safety. Finally, the AIT held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in Somalia did not engage the obligations of the Refugee Convention or engage Article 3 of the Convention for all female returnees. A differential impact had to be shown. Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator.\n58. The AIT observed in passing that, on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing, it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an IDP camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under Article 3, if not under the Refugee Convention.\n#### B. HH and Others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022\n59. In HH and others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that for the purposes of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a situation of internal armed conflict existed in Mogadishu. The AIT held, however, that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians, they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and, as a consequence, a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area.\n60. The AIT found that although clan support networks were strained, they had not yet collapsed. Majority clans continued to have arms, even though their militias no longer controlled the city. A person from a majority clan, or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with, or acceptance by, a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance, including at times of displacement. A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at r", "001-91088": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BOOTH v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26).\n16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%.\n17.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended the disciplinary and court-martial procedures regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955. References below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to the Army Act 1955 as amended. The statutory disciplinary provisions applicable to armed forces personnel are contained in the above-listed three \u201cservice discipline Acts\u201d. Each Act specifies, in virtually identical terms, the offences for which persons subject to that Act can be tried and the punishments applicable. Persons subject to armed forces law are thereby subjected to a common code of offences and punishments.\n#### A. The Offence\n20. The offences triable under the 1955 Act include misconduct in action; offences by or in relation to sentries, person on watch etc; failure to attend for, neglect of, duty; looting; mutiny and related offences; insubordinate behaviour; disobedience of a lawful command or standing order; desertion, absence without leave and related offences; malingering, drunkenness, disorderly conduct and fighting; refusal to submit to drug testing; false statements on entry or enlistment; offences harmful to morale; scandalous or disgraceful behaviour; ill-treatment of persons of inferior rank and conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (see sections 24-68 of the 1955 Act).\n21. In addition to the above, any person subject to armed forces law who commits a civilian offence (any act punishable by the laws of England) is also guilty of an offence against the service discipline Acts (section 70 of the 1955 Act).\n22. Section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cAny person subject to military law who - ...\n(b) uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer\nshall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.\u201d\n#### B.

At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person\u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness.\n23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right:\n\u201cOf more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law.\nThe case of Harrison v. Carswell (1975) 62 D.L.R. 3d 68 in the Supreme Court of Canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre, against the wishes of the owner of the centre.

Transfer and restriction directions on prisoners under the Mental Health Act 1983\n19. Under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d), the Secretary of State may transfer a person serving a sentence of imprisonment to hospital if he is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment, and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, and, in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition. A transfer under section 47 of the 1983 Act is called a \u201ctransfer direction\u201d, and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under section 37 (1) of the 1983 Act (that is, where a court convicts a person and, instead of sentencing him, orders his detention in hospital).\n20.

Disability benefits\n23. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK).\n#### B. Procedure\n24.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 March, 11 July and 12 December 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Pertinent Constitutional provisions\n17. Article 38(1) of the Irish Constitution provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. By Article 40, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.\n#### B. The Offences Against the State Act 1939\n18. The Offences Against the State Act 1939 (\u201cthe 1939 Act\u201d) is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts.\n19. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act.\n20. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances\u2019 legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date.\n22. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act.\n23. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the [police] may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person\u2019s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.\n2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the [police], fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\u201d\n24. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the Government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has, with Government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The Committee has commenced its work.\n#### C. Relevant case-law\n25. In the case of the People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan (1979 IR 45) the accused had been arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act and had made certain statements to the police. The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest (section 30), the existence of section 52 of the 1939 Act and even though no section 52 requests had actually been made, the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201cpending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter\u201d (Schedule 2, paragraph 16). Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention. It is a form of licensed consent to enter the United Kingdom which may be subjected to conditions, including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person\u2019s residence, employment or occupation (Schedule 2, paragraph 21).\n18. In general (that is, in cases other than those involving Oakington), the SSHD\u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding.\n19. On 16 March 2000 Barbara Roche MP, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new Oakington Reception Centre. Oakington asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018quickly\u2019, including those which may be certified as being \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019. To assist immigration officers, lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at Oakington could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with. It was said that Oakington would strengthen the ability of the Home Office to deal quickly with asylum applications.\n20. Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for Oakington detention. Cases in which detention at Oakington would not be suitable included the following:\n- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors;\n- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers;\n- cases in which there was a dispute as to age;\n- disabled applicants;\n- persons with special medical needs;\n- cases involving disputes as to nationality; and\n- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative.\n21. In addition, all persons believed to be at risk of absconding (from Oakington) were not deemed suitable for detention at Oakington.\n22. The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, social visits room and a religious observance room. The following description was used in the present case:\n\u201cAll of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant, medical centre, social visits room, religious observance and recreation. The practical operation and facilities at Oakington are, however, very different from other detention centres. In particular, there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security, reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications. The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space. Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although, in the interests of privacy and safety, there are two areas where only females and families may go.\u201d\n23.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge. Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside (see, in this connection, the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n#### B. Release on licence and revocation of a licence\n13. Under section 61 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State may release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment only if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.\n14. Under section 62 (7) of the 1967 Act, if a person subject to a licence is convicted on indictment of an offence, the trial court may, whether or not it passes any other sentence on him, revoke the licence.\n15.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ...is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\nThis section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which back dated to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n18. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)c).\n19. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000, which permitted remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the Government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, a statement that in introducing the measure in Parliament the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n20. On 22 February 2001, the Secretary of State gave his reasons for maintaining the policy of disenfranchising convicted prisoners:\n\u201cBy committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender\u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence, such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period. There is more than one element to punishment than forcible detention. Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society, amongst which is the right to vote for one\u2019s representative.\u201d\n21. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d)\n22. Relevant provisions of the ICCPR provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\u201d\n23. In the General Comment (No. 25(57)) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40(4) of the ICCPR dated 27 August 1996, the Committtee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable.

The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n16. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c). No leave to appeal is required.\n17. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n18.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nInterception of correspondence\n24. Section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Where a bankruptcy order has been made, the court may from time to time, on the application of the official receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, order the Post Office to re-direct and send or deliver to the official receiver or trustee or otherwise any postal packet (within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1953) which would otherwise be sent or delivered by them to the bankrupt at such place or places as may be specified in the order.\n2. An order under this section has effect for such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified in the order.\u201d\n25. Trustees in Bankruptcy have other statutory powers, which are more stringent than the power to apply for a re-direction order but which may nonetheless need to be used, in appropriate cases, if Trustees are properly to investigate the bankrupt\u2019s affairs for the ultimate benefit of his creditors. In particular, under section 365 of the Insolvency Act 1986 a Trustee may obtain a warrant authorising him to seize property, books and/or records falling into the debtor\u2019s estate. Furthermore, section 366 of the Act allows the court (on application by a Trustee) to summon a variety of persons before it to give an affidavit and/or produce documents.\n26. A bankrupt owes a statutory duty, pursuant to section 333 of the Insolvency Act 1986, to give to the Trustee such information as to his affairs, attend meetings with the Trustee and do such other things as the Trustee may reasonably require for the carrying out of his relevant functions.", "001-81110": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF HASAN ERKAN v.

The right of association is further protected by section 8, which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it.\n#### B. The relationship between employers and employees\n18. Section 10 of the 1976 Act gives employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees. It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees, who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions.\n19. Under section 26 of the 1976 Act, a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s organisations but also on their members, i.e. companies and individual workers. Moreover, in practice, the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect. This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise.\n20. Under section 27 of the 1976 Act, an employer and an employee cannot conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound. This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void. While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers. Consequently, while the contracts in question remain valid, the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union.\n#### C. The monitoring system\n21. Monitoring of wages for hourly work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch. It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union\u2019s representatives to the employer. If a mistake is discovered, clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter. In some cases, formal negotiations are required.\n22. Under the terms of the Construction Agreement, the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work. The fee \u2013 1.5% of the employee\u2019s wages \u2013 is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual wor"}
