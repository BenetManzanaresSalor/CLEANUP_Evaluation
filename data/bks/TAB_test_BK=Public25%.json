ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained that the proceedings on compensation had not been concluded within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they had lasted almost seven years. The relevant parts of Article 6 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...\u201d\n20. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the \u201creasonable length\u201d requirement laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 began on 2 and 6 March 1989 for Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy and Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan respectively, on 10 April 1989 for Mr Yusuf \u00c7am\u00e7a and on 1 June 1989 for Mr Galip Yalman. They ended on 30 May 1996 when the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 second appeal. The period under consideration thus lasted approximately seven years.\n21. The Government submitted that in order to decide on the compensation issue the Sinop Assize Court had to request the case files from the courts which had decided on the applicants\u2019 detention on remand. They further maintained that the applicants\u2019 case had involved several appeal stages. They referred in this connection to the case-law of the Court which establishes that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings depends, among other things, on the particular circumstances of the case (Konig v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 September 2002 and 8 July 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicants allege a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in connection with the length of the proceedings at issue. Article 6 provides, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n18. The proceedings began on 12 February 1986 when K issued a writ against the applicants and Mrs Price. They ended on 30 March 1998 when leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the House of Lords. They thus lasted a total of 12 years, one month and 18 days.\n19. The Government contend that the length of the proceedings before the setting down of the case for trial in 1994 was attributable wholly to the conduct of the parties, and that it was for the parties to apply for an appropriate direction if they had perceived it to be in their interests to do so. After the case had been set down, the case was dealt with by three instances between August 1994 and March 1998, and the only periods of delay for which the authorities were responsible were: one month when the commencement of the trial was adjourned; the six months\u2019 period before the Court of Appeal heard the case, during which time arrangements for the hearing were made, and the four months\u2019 period for delivery of the House of Lords\u2019 decision, during which period the judicial members of the House examined the complaints and the supporting material.\n20. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000-IV, \u00a7 19; Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, ECHR 2001-VIII, \u00a7 52).\n21. Once the case had been set down for trial, the case proceeded through three levels of jurisdiction in a little over three and a half years, notwithstanding the complicating factors that the plaintiff had been declared bankrupt and the property at issue was out of the jurisdiction. The Court is aware that some discussion between the parties may be necessary in civil proceedings to clarify the disputed issues, but considers that that period of three and a half years could have been considered a \u201creasonable time\u201d in this case.\n22. However, the question is whether the Government can be held responsible for the period preceding the trial of the action, even though the parties knew, or should have known, that the High Court would not act of its own motion. The Government refer, in this respect, to the case of Union Alimentaria Sanders v.

The applicants complained in the first place that they had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Izmir State Security Court. They further alleged that the national courts had convicted them on the basis of the statements that they had made to the police and to the investigating judge. The applicants finally maintained that they had been deprived of their right to defend themselves by a lawyer. In this connection, they invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n14.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime are set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Piechowicz v. Poland (no. 20071/07, \u00a7\u00a7 110-17, 17 April 2012), and Horych v. Poland (no. 13621/08, \u00a7\u00a7 49-56, 17 April 2012).\n16. The provisions of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences concerning the imposition of the regime on convicted persons read as follows:\nArticle 88 \u00a7 3\n\u201cA convicted person posing a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison shall be placed in a prison with a closed regime in conditions ensuring increased protection of society and the security of the prison.\u201d\nArticle 88a\n\u201c1. The convicted person referred to in Article 88 \u00a7 3 shall be placed in a designated wing or in a cell of a prison with a closed regime. A penitentiary judge shall be informed about this placement.\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 above shall be applied to a convicted person whose characteristics, personal circumstances, motivations, behaviour when committing the offence, type of offence and its consequences, behaviour in prison, or degree of depravity pose a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison, and who:\n(2a) during the prior or current term of imprisonment posed a danger to the security of a prison or a remand centre in that he was a leader or an active participant in a collective remonstrance in a prison or a remand centre ...\u201d\n17. Article 88b of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences lays down specific arrangements applicable to convicted persons to whom the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime is applied. They are identical to those specified in Article 212b of the Code applicable to persons remanded in custody (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 106).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that he had been unlawfully classified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and subjected to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n19. The Government contested that allegation.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that the prolonged imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime had been in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In his opinion, there had been no reasonable grounds for applying the regime to him. He contested the allegation that he had been the leader of a collective protest. He had never been charged with or convicted of such an act. He admitted to having refused, on one occasion, to eat his breakfast while at the Opole Lubelskie Prison.\n22. The applicant submitted that he had been held mostly in solitary confinement. He referred to the prolonged and excessive isolation from his family, the outside world and other detainees, and to other restrictions, such as wearing \u201cjoined shackles\u201d, routine strip searches to which he had been subjected on a daily basis and, lastly, monitoring of his cell (including the sanitary facilities) via closed\u2011circuit television. The applicant stressed that all of his movements in the cell had been constantly monitored. The images had been recorded and stored for at least seven days. Every time he left or entered his cell, usually several times a day, he had been subjected to a degrading, exceptionally intrusive body search by at least three prison guards.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant complained of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in his trial and appeal. Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n25. The applicant was arrested on the rape charge on 30 October 1995 and his appeal was finally rejected on 22 July 1999. The criminal proceedings lasted three years, eight months and twenty three days.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n26. The applicant submitted that the case was not particularly complex. After conviction, his lawyers were not informed of the failure to cite the witness W. for some time and any delay or complication arising from that derived from the trial Advocate Depute's improper conduct in the first place. Thereafter, there was delay due to lack of availability of the Advocate Depute and the lack of time allocated in the appeal court. He did not refuse to go to the first listed appeal hearing; the prison unjustifiably preventing him from attending in civilian clothing. He claimed that there was no explanation for the delay of eight and a half months between the taking of W.'s evidence and the appeal hearing.\n27. The Government submitted that the period taken from 30 October 1995 to 22 July 1999 was reasonable in all the circumstances.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, in 1974 the applicant had not been the owner of any property located in northern Cyprus. Nor was he, according to the same source, the owner of any property at the present time. Given that in 1974 the applicant had had no right or interest in relation to the properties at issue, no question of a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could arise. Even assuming that the applicant had acquired the properties in question in 1990, this would have happened sixteen years after the events of 1974 and three years after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. Therefore, he should have known that access to the properties was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it.\n13. In the light of the above, the Government argued that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n14. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points. Administrative and judicial remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were therefore accessible to them.\n15. Law no. 49/2003 provided for the establishment of an independent Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission with jurisdiction to award compensation for Greek-Cypriot immovable properties in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, on the basis of the market value on 20 July 1974, plus compensation for the loss of use, loss of income and increases in the value of property. The decisions of this Commission could be appealed to the High Administrative Court. Given the existence of this remedy, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### B. The applicant\u2019s arguments\n16. The applicant observed that his parents had been the lawful owners of the properties in question in 1974. The Government could have ascertained this by consulting the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d. There had been the expectation that the applicant and his sister would, in due course, become the registered owners. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive the applicant\u2019s parents of their title (see Loizidou v. Turkey, (merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The applicant had become the legal owner of the properties on 20 April 1990 and this fact had been recorded by the official authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The donation could not have been recorded by the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d because the authorities of the \u201cTRNC\u201d considered that the properties had already been expropriated. The Government could not rely on the records of the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d to contest the applicant\u2019s title.\n17. Even assuming that the applicant had had no property rights until 20 April 1990, that would only mean that there had not been a continuing violation of his rights under Article 1 Protocol No. 1 between 1974 and that date. In order to establish that there had been a violation of these rights after 20 April 1990, it was sufficient to show that the applicant had not been allowed to enjoy his properties from that date onwards. In any event, the applicant had a proprietary interest in the properties in 1974 and the house were he had been living had been his home. The fact that in 1990 the applicant might have known that he would not have enjoyed his property was irrelevant.\n18. The applicant alleged that Law no. 49/2003 was aimed at providing a false and illusory domestic remedy in order to avoid the property claims of Greek Cypriots being adjudicated by the European Court of Human Rights. Furthermore, the objection of non-exhaustion had been raised after the application had been declared admissible. Law no. 49/2003 had not existed at the time when the application was lodged, did not provide a sufficient and effective remedy, was discriminatory and took as its basis that the expropriation was lawful. Furthermore, the applicant could lose his victim status only if the violation of the Convention was expressly recognised and fully remedied by the respondent Government\u2019s authorities. This had not happened in the present case.\n#### C. Third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n19. The Government of Cyprus submitted that the applicant had acquired his rights as owner in 1990, after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. He was therefore entitled to complain about any violation which had occurred after that date. The appropriate claimant in respect of earlier violations would have been the previous owner (the applicant\u2019s parents).\n20. The third-party intervener further submitted that the compensation available under Law no. 49/2003 did not alter the fact that the Court did not recognise the acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d as expropriation. In any event, the said law did not provide any redress for breaches of Article 8 of the Convention and applied only to an extremely restricted category of violations of the right of property. It could not be considered an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted in relation to claims introduced or declared admissible before it was enacted or enforced. Finally, its provisions were incompatible with Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention as well as with 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### D. The Court\u2019s assessment\n21. In its decision on the admissibility, the Court considered that the Government\u2019s objections that the application was incompatible ratione materiae and ratione temporis were closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaints and that they should be examined together with the merits of the application.\n22. In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the Government did not contest the applicant\u2019s statement that his parents had been the owners of properties in the District of Kyrenia. They argued, however, that the properties at issue had subsequently been expropriated by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. The Court recalls that in the case of Loizidou ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46) it held that it could not attribute legal validity for the purposes of the Convention to the provisions of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d fundamental law, concerning the acquisition by the \u201cTRNC\u201d of the immovable properties considered to be abandoned on 13 February 1975. It furthermore considered that Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, had left their properties in the northern part of the island in 1974 could not be deemed to have lost title to their property. It follows that until 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents had still been the owners of the properties described in paragraph 10 above. They were therefore capable of transmitting ownership to their descendants.\n23. The Court further notes that on 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents donated half of their properties to the applicant and that the latter registered his titles in the Land Registry of the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraph 9 above). In spite of this, he has been unable to make use of and have access to his properties. At the relevant time, Turkey had already recognised the right of individual petition. It is also to be recalled that the Court had duly examined and rejected the objection of inadmissibility by reason of lack of effective control over northern Cyprus raised by the Turkish Government in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 69-81, ECHR 2001-IV). It sees no reason to depart from its reasoning and conclusions in the instant case.\n24. Lastly, as regards the objections of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status raised by the Government in their further observations of 23 October 2003 relating to the Law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the Court notes that these objections were raised after the application was declared admissible. They cannot, therefore, be taken into account at this stage of the proceedings (see Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, \u00a7 20, 31 July 2003).\n25. It follows that the Government\u2019s preliminary objections should be dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus had prevented him from having access to his properties situated in that part of the island.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of pr", "001-79346": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF WASSDAHL v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that the length of the administrative proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n23. The period to be taken into consideration began on 28 May 1996 and ended on 11 September 2003. It thus lasted over seven years and three months for one administrative and three judicial levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not awaited the final outcome of the national compensation proceedings against the Swedish State before introducing the complaint before the Court. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court, pronounced on 9 June 2005, where the plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, there was an effective remedy available to the applicant which he should have been obliged to exhaust before complaining to the Court.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences and tariffs\n13. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. At the time of sentence, a \u201ctariff\u201d is imposed which represents the minimum period that the prisoner will have to serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. A life prisoner will not be released on licence until after the tariff period has been completed.\n#### B. Release on licence of mandatory life sentence prisoners\n14. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in Section 35(2):\n\u201cIf recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.\u201d\n15. On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on licence, the Secretary of State:\n\u201c...will consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.\u201d\n16. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (\u201cthe tariff\u201d) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see for example, R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 WLR135; R. v. Parole Board ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 AllER576).\n#### ", "001-60735": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LUNDEVALL v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Lundevall v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr M.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n20. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1987 and 1996, when the applicant made his applications to the Office, this corresponded to 6,868 and 10,317 Swedish kronor (SEK), respectively.\n#### B. Procedure\n21. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Appeals may be made against the Office\u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act.\n22. The latter provision enables the Office to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision, provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court. Thus, the Office must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error, miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason. The question of changing a decision under section 10 a should, in principle, be raised within two years from the day the decision was taken. However, it may nevertheless be changed if it appears only after the elapse of this two-year period that it was based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or if there are other exceptional reasons. A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned.\n23. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n24. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n25. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n26.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Presence of witness in court\n17. Under Scots law, a witness who has been present in court without the court\u2019s permission and without consent from the opposite party may still be allowed to give evidence provided that \u201cit appears to the court that the presence of the witness was not the result of culpable negligence or criminal intent, and that the witness had not been unduly instructed or influenced by what took place during his presence, or that injustice will not be done by his examination\u201c (section 140 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c).\n#### B. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n18. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n19. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the 1975 Act). No leave to appeal is required.\n20. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n21. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n22. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### C. Representation of appellants by counsel\n23. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### D. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n24. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n25. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n26. To extend legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n27. The Board takes its decisions on the basis of the documents before it, which normally include copies of the note of appeal, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the trial judge\u2019s report on the case. The views expressed by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and counsel will also be taken into account.\n28", "001-89821": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF GENCER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. According to Article 24 \u00a7 1 of Law no. 3083, persons who are convicted of the offences defined in the first Section of the second Part of the Criminal Code and in Articles 312 \u00a7 2, 536 and 537 of the Criminal Code cannot benefit from the distribution of land. Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the same Law provides that land shall be taken back, had the right holder been convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the first paragraph subsequent to the acquisition of land.\n17. Article 38 \u00a7 3 of the Regulations on the Application of Law no. 3083 provides that, in view of the particularities and security of a region and subsequent to obtaining the opinion of the security institutions, the Directorate General is authorised to make amendments in the right holders list prepared by the Commission.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n18. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies given that he had not requested the rectification of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision and that he had not raised an objection to the Gaziantep Administrative Court\u2019s decision to dismiss his request for a stay of execution.\n19. As regards the first part of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected similar objections in previous cases (see, in particular, Da\u011ftekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 70516/01, \u00a7 22, 13 December 2007, and G\u00f6k and Others v. Turkey, nos. 71867/01, 71869/01, 73319/01 and 74858/01, \u00a7\u00a7 47- 48, 27 July 2006). It finds no particular circumstances, in the present application, which would require it to depart from that conclusion. Consequently, it rejects this part of the Government\u2019s objection.\n20. As regards the second limb of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court recalls that, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it may only deal with an issue after all domestic remedies have been exhausted.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Act of 26 May 1981 No. 25), Chapter 18 on Criminal Investigation, contains the following provisions:\nArticle 226\n\u201cThe purpose of the investigation is to obtain the necessary information for deciding whether an indictment should be preferred, and to serve as preparation for the trial of the case. ...\nIf a specific person is under suspicion, the investigation shall seek to clarify both the evidence against him and the evidence in his favour.\nThe investigation shall be carried out as rapidly as possible and in such a way that no one is unnecessarily exposed to suspicion or inconvenience.\u201d\nArticle 249\n\u201cThe question of preferring an indictment shall be decided as soon as the case is sufficiently prepared for this purpose.\u201d\n17. In the proceedings before the Court, the Government drew attention to certain case-law of the Norwegian Supreme Court, according to which a 64-year-old man had been sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and gross embezzlement totalling NOK 5 ,000,000 (Norsk Retstidende \u2013 \u201cRt\u201d1964, p. 773); a man without a previous criminal record had been sentenced to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment for economic crimes, including gross fraud, amounting to NOK 100,000,000 (Rt 1990, p. 641); a person had been sentenced to 4 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 9,500,000 (Rt 1992, p. 106), and a person had been sentenced to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 1,200,000 with respect to over 20 victims (Rt 1992, p. 1016).\nThe applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention, inter alia, to Supreme Court rulings in which a lawyer\u2019s secretary had been sentenced to 1 year and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and embezzlement with respect to NOK 1,100,000 (Rt 1995, p. 1962) and another decision where two men, aged 43 and 28, with previous criminal records, had been sentenced to 8 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross tax fraud amounting to NOK 1,500,000 (Rt 1995, p. 250).\nTHE LAW\n### I.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n16. Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n17. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n18. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n19. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:\n\u201c353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\nA fresh claim, if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of State, and if refused, gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits. If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim, their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim.\n#### B. Relevant case-law\n20. In J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n21. The Court of Appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test. It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3. Fifthly, an important factor in determining whether removal would breach Article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill-treatment in the receiving State, if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide, was objectively well-founded. A fear found not to be objectively well-founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of Article 3. Finally, the Court of Appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and/or receiving States had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide. The existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of Article 3 as a result of removal.\n22. The Court of Appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages, namely, in the United Kingdom, in transit, and in the receiving State. The threshold for Article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving State was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the United Kingdom. In the case of the particular appellant, the Court of Appeal found that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the United Kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities; that the Secretary of State would provide appropriately qualified escorts and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport; and that in light of the finding that the applicant\u2019s fears of return to Sri Lanka were not objectively well-founded, and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that State, the risk of suicide in Sri Lanka would not reach the very high threshold of Article 3.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n24. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. According to the Government, the applicant could have argued that he was a suicide risk and raised Article 3 of the Convention in the context of his appeal against deportation, but did not do so, relying instead only upon Article 8. He could also have raised the fact of his risk of suicide in his application for judicial review but, again, did not do so. He also failed to renew his application for judicial review. The first time that the applicant claimed to be at risk of suicide was in his request to this Court for interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n26. The Government referred to their letter of 2 December 2009 to the Court, which outlined the special protective measures that had been put in place in the detention centre in respect of the applicant, once notice of his previous suicide attempt had been received. The Government stated that, on the one subsequent occasion when concerns had arisen whilst the applicant was detained, namely on 29 December 2009 when he had claimed to have taken an overdose of paracetamol, he had been assessed by a medical team and found not to be in danger. Apart from that incident, the applicant had not attempted suicide in detention or following his release. However, the Government would put in place precautionary measures should the applicant be detained again prior to deportation, and the contractor responsible for his removal would be made aware of the applicant\u2019s circumstances. Special measures would be taken, including a medical escort if necessary, to mitigate any risk of suicide during the removal process and the applicant would be accompanied until the point of arrival in Nigeria. There was sufficient psychiatric treatment available in Nigeria, should the applicant require it. The Government therefore submitted that, given that all reasonable steps had been and would be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of suicide, the applicant had not been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, and nor would his deportation amount to such treatment.\n##### 2. The applicant\n27. The applicant, on the other hand, contended that the risk of suicide had only arisen after his application to revoke the deportation order was refused, and that there had been no right of appeal against this decision. The applicant\u2019s first suicide attempt had taken place on 13 August 2009, which was the same day on which his application for judicial review had been lodged by his representatives. Although no mention of the applicant being at risk of suicide had been made in the judicial review application, he claimed that his representatives had raised this matter in letters to both the Secretary of State and the High Court dated 18 September 2009, but that the letter to the Secretary of State had received no response, and that the High Court, in refusing his judicial review application on 30 October 2009, had not addressed the matter either. As regards the applicant\u2019s failure to renew his application for judicial review, he submitted that he had been apprehended on 10 November 2009 and served with removal directions before he was able to renew the application.\n28. The applicant contended that the Government had been made aware of his attempted suicide on 13 August 2009. He also submitted that he made a further suicide attempt on 11 December 2009 or 29 December 2009 whilst detained in the immigration detention centre. He claimed that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. The Court notes the Government\u2019s preliminary objection and also recalls its finding in NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 90, 17 July 2008 that in expulsion cases judicial review is in principle an effective remedy which applicants should be required to exhaust before applying to this Court. However, the Court considers it unnecessary to rule on whether the present applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this complaint since, in any event, it considers the complaint to be manifestly ill-founded.\n30. It is well-established that expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country. Article 3 is absolute and it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward", "001-170347": "\ufeff\nGRAND CHAMBER\nCASE OF HUTCHINSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 57592/08)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n17 January 2017\nThis judgment is final but it may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Hutchinson v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber), sitting as a Grand Chamber composed of:\nAndr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3, President,\nI\u015f\u0131l Karaka\u015f,\nJosep Casadevall,\nLuis L\u00f3pez Guerra,\nMirjana Lazarova Trajkovska,\nAngelika Nu\u00dfberger,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nGanna Yudkivska,\nPaulo Pinto de Albuquerque,\nLinos-Alexandre Sicilianos,\nErik M\u00f8se,\nHelena J\u00e4derblom,\nPaul Mahoney,\nFaris Vehabovi\u0107,\nKsenija Turkovi\u0107,\nBranko Lubarda,\nYonko Grozev, judges,\nand Johan Callewaert, Deputy Grand Chamber Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 October 2015 and 10 October 2016,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts). At the hearing in the present case, the Government indicated that there were on that date 56 prisoners serving whole life sentences. No prisoner in this category has been released since the date of the Vinter judgment.\n#### A. The Human Rights Act 1998\n14. The Human Rights Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201cSection 2 - Interpretation of Convention rights.\n(1) A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any\u2014\n(a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights,\n...\nSection 3 - Interpretation of legislation.\n(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\n...\nSection 6 - Acts of public authorities.\n(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\u2014\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\n(3) In this section \u201cpublic authority\u201d includes\u2014\n(a) a court or tribunal, and\n(b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,\nbut does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.\n...\nSection 7 - Proceedings.\n(1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may\u2014\n(a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or\n(b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,\nbut only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.\n...\nSection 8 - Judicial remedies.\n(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\n...\u201d\n#### B. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997\n15. Section 30 of the Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\u201d\n#### C. Prison Service Order 4700\n16. The policy of the Secretary of State for Justice on the exercise of the power of release on compassionate grounds is set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued as Prison Service Order 4700. The criteria, as formulated in April 2010, provide as follows:\n\u201cthe prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stoke;\nand\nthe risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\nfurther imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\nthere are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\nearly release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family\u201d.\n#### D. Court of Appeal decision in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin\n17. A special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear these appeals, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge. It gave its decision (\u201cMcLoughlin\u201d) on 18 February 2014, in light of the judgment of this Court in the Vinter case.\n18. The appellant Newell challenged as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention the whole life order imposed on him for a murder committed while he was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder. The McLoughlin case took the form of a reference by the Attorney General under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1986, who contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The trial judge had instead imposed a life sentence with a tariff of forty years for a murder committed by a man with previous convictions for murder and manslaughter.\n19. In its decision, the Court of Appeal traced the development of the whole life sentence and the review of such sentences. It stated at paragraph 7 (citations omitted):\n\u201ci) On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (...).\n\u201cIn addition, I have decided that for those life sentence prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by their remaining in prison for the whole of their life, there will in future be an additional ministerial review when the prisoner has been in custody for 25 years. The purpose of this review will be solely to consider whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a tariff of a determinate period. The review will be confined to the considerations of retribution and deterrence. Where appropriate, further ministerial reviews will normally take place at five-yearly intervals thereafter. Existing prisoners who fall into this category and who have already served 25 years or more in custody will not be disadvantaged. Their cases will be reviewed by ministers as soon as is practicable and after any representations they may wish to make.\u201d\nii) That policy was modified by a different Home Secretary on 10 November 1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written answer):\n\u201cSo far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.\u201d\niii) In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley [...] that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was unlawful, this had been corrected by the 1997 policy which permitted the taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison. In the appeal to the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of exceptional circumstances (...) Lord Steyn, when approving the legality of the Home Secretary\u2019s 1997 policy, recorded the way in which the policy had been clarified (...):\n\u201c.... counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the policy of imposing a whole life tariff merely involves the expression of the current view of the Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution and deterrence make it inappropriate ever to release such a prisoner. It does not rule out reconsideration. The Secretary of State envisages the possibility of release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of State is prepared to reconsider any whole life tariff decision from time to time.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal then set out the relevant criteria of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), commenting that these were \u201chighly restrictive\u201d (paragraph 11 of the McLoughlin decision). It raised the question whether the statutory scheme was compatible with Article 3. In answering the question, it stated:\n\u201c(b) Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life order is imposed?\n19. The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self-evident, that there is no violation of Article 3 if a prisoner in fact spends the whole of his life in prison. One example is an offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life.\n20. However, the Grand Chamber considered that the justification for detention might shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might cease to be just after the passage of many years. It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of its judgment that for a life sentence to be compatible with Article 3, there must therefore be both a prospect of release and a possibility of review. It added at paragraph 122:\n\u201cA whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d\n21. It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124:\n\u201cHowever, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.\u201d\n22. Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a whole life order as just punishment, it concluded that a legal regime for a review during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed.\n23. Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the Strasbourg Court did not determine that the imposition of a whole life tariff itself violates Article 3, we return briefly to the arguments advanced contingently on the hypothesis that it did. In our judgment section 3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs. That is because section 269(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion that no order for early release should be made because of the seriousness of the offence alone or in combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply. That being so, section 6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public authority to act compatibly with the Convention.\n24. The only remedy available in the domestic courts on this hypothesis would be a declaration of incompatibility, the discretionary remedy available under section 4 of the Human Rights Act when primary legislation is found to be incompatible with the Convention. Such a remedy is not available in the Crown Court and would not, in any event, affect the continuing operation of the statutory scheme.\n(c) Is the regime under section 30 a regime for reducibility which is in fact compliant with Article 3?\n25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of section 30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under section 30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u201cAt present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u201d\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of section 30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u201cThe fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his section 30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u201d\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that section 30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u201cAt the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.\u201d\n29. We disagree. In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to \u201cpossible exceptional release of whole life prisoners\u201d. As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to exercise his power under section 30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.\n30. As we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that the policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence. It is important, therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is.\n31. First, the power of review under the section arises if there are exceptional circumstances. The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that although the whole life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances have since arisen. It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is of itself sufficiently certain.\n32. Second, the Secretary of State must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds. The policy set out in the Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will be considered by the Secretary of State. The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds. He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the Lifer Manual. In the passages in Hindley to which we have referred at paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions of section 30 of the 1997 Act, require the Secretary of State to take into account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds.\n33. Third, the term \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d must be read, as the court made clear in R v Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3. They are not restricted to what is set out in the Lifer Manual. It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis.\n34. Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review.\n35. In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender \u201chope\u201d or the \u201cpossibility\u201d of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\n36. It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable. We find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life. But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases. The interpretation of section 30 we have set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of exceptional release.\nConclusion\n37. Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the CJA 2003 and in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 21. Although we were told by Mr Eadie QC that it might be many years before the applications might be made under section 30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer justifiable penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would not discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n20. The Court makes reference to the materials referred to in the Vinter judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 59-81). It refers in particular to one of the Council of Europe texts mentioned there, Recommendation Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on conditional release (parole). This provides, as relevant:\n\u201cDiscretionary release system\n16. The minimum period that prisoners have to serve to become eligible for conditional release should be fixed in accordance with the law.\n17. The relevant authorities should initiate the necessary procedure to enable a decision on conditional release to be taken as soon as the prisoner has served the minimum period.\n18. The criteria that prisoners have to fulfil in order to be conditionally released should be clear and explicit. They should also be realistic in the sense that they should take into account the prisoners\u2019 personalities and social and economic circumstances as well as the availability of resettlement programmes.\n...\n20. The criteria for granting conditional release should be applied so as to grant conditional release to all prisoners who are considered as meeting the minimum level of safeguards for becoming law-abiding citizens. It should be incumbent on the authorities to show that a prisoner has not fulfilled the criteria.\n21. If the decision-making authority decides not to grant conditional release it should set a date for reconsidering the question. In any case, prisoners should be able to reapply to the decision-making authority as soon as their situation has changed to their advantage in a substantial manner.\n...\n### VIII. Procedural safeguards\n32. Decisions on granting, postponing or revoking conditional release, as well as on imposing or modifying conditions and measures attached to it, should be taken by authorities established by law in accordance with procedures covered by the following safeguards:\na. convicted persons should have the right to be heard in person and to be assisted according to the law;\nb. the decision-making authority should give careful consideration to any elements, including statements, presented by convicted persons in support of their case;\nc. convicted persons should have adequate access to their file;\nd. decisions should state the underlying reasons and be notified in writing.\n33. Convicted persons should be able to make a complaint to a higher independent and impartial decision-making authority established by law against the substance of the decision as well as against non-respect of the procedural guarantees.\u201d\n21. The Court also refers to the 2006 European Prison Rules, in particular Rule 30.3 which provides:\n\u201cPrisoners shall be informed about any legal proceedings in which they are involved and, if they are sentenced, the time to be served and the possibilities of early release.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that his whole life order violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. The Chamber judgment\n23. The Chamber noted that the Government initially considered themselves not to be in a position to submit observations on the merits of the case, as they recognised that the principles set out in the Vinter case were applicable. The Government changed their stance following the McLoughlin decision, arguing that a whole life sentence was now to be regarded as reducible. The Chamber examined the McLoughlin decision and recalled that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic law. It further observed that it was a well\u2011entrenched and necessary part of the legal tradition of the United Kingdom to develop the law through judicial interpretation. As the Court of Appeal had specifically addressed the doubts raised in Vinter regarding the clarity of the applicable domestic law, and set out an unequivocal statement of the legal position, that interpretation had to be accepted by the European Court. It concluded that the power of release under section 30 of the 1997 Act, exercised in the manner delineated in McLoughlin, was sufficient to comply with the requirements of Article 3.\n#### B. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n24. The Government agreed with the Chamber judgment. They maintained that the Court of Appeal had set out, authoritatively and conclusively, the operation of domestic law in clear and unequivocal terms. By virtue of sections 3 and 6 of the Human Rights Act, section 30 of the 1997 Act had to be interpreted and applied broadly enough so as to comply with Article 3 in every case. The Lifer Manual did not and could not restrict or in any way fetter this obligation. Therefore, as the Court of Appeal had stated, the fact that the text of the Manual had not been revised was of no legal consequence. The Manual remained valid inasmuch as it laid out the approach to be taken where release was sought on grounds of advanced terminal illness or severe incapacity. The McLoughlin decision had further clarified that the Secretary of State was obliged under domestic law to consider all relevant circumstances of each case in a manner compatible with Article 3 \u2013 there was no remaining unclarity as to the law in this regard. Section 30 operated in precisely the way that the Vinter judgment had held would be sufficient to satisfy with the requirements of Article 3.\n25. As for the basis for the Secretary of State\u2019s review of sentence, it was clear that the term used in section 30, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, encompassed exceptional progress towards rehabilitation. The relevant yardstick in the Secretary of State\u2019s review would be that stated in Vinter, i.e. whether there had been any changes in the life of the prisoner and such progress towards rehabilitation that continued detention could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. A whole life prisoner therefore knew what he must do to have a prospect of release, and what criteria would apply to the review. No greater specificity was required; it was neither necessary nor practicable to seek to lay down in greater detail what a prisoner must be able to demonstrate to be considered for release or reduction of sentence. The European Court itself had not identified specific criteria in its Article 3 case law, but expressed itself in more general terms. In every individual case, therefore, all the relevant circumstances of the prisoner would be taken into account. This permitted the necessary flexibility in the review, adapting it to each set of individual circumstances.\n26. The domestic law was both accessible and foreseeable for prisoners. It was enough that they sought legal advice, which was available to them, or asked the prison administration, and they would receive an explanation of the applicable legal provisions. To every request the Secretary of State was required to give a reasoned response, which would be subject to judicial review. That review would not merely react to the decisions of the Secretary of State, but would bear on the merits of the case. The procedure had the capacity to develop the practical working out of the relevant considerations in this context, such as what amounted to a legitimate penological ground. Nor would successful judicial review merely mean the Secretary of State taking the decision again. It was within the power of the courts to directly order the release of a prisoner, if this was warranted.\n27. Regarding the timing of the review, the Government recalled that Vinter had regarded this matter as being within the margin of appreciation of the domestic authorities, which should not now be narrowed. That judgment did not prescribe a review after twenty-five years, but simply observed that the comparative and international materials reflected clear support for this particular arrangement. In any event, identifying such a timeframe was more relevant to a system which did not provide for a review for a very long period, which was not the case in the domestic system. Legal certainty did not require a specific time constraint on sentence review, when that review was premised on the ability of the prisoner to make a case that their detention was no longer justified. This they could do at any time; they were not obliged to wait an indeterminate number of years. That could be regarded as more advantageous to the prisoner than being required to serve a long, minimum term of years before being permitted to apply for review. Regarding the circumstances of the applicant, they noted that he had not suggested at any stage that there was no legitimate penological ground for his continued detention. There was nothing to stop him applying to the Secretary of State at any time in the future for a review of sentence.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant disagreed with the Chamber judgment, which he criticised as being inconsistent with Vinter, as well as with other cases decided by this Court since that judgment. He considered that the situation in domestic law remained contrary to Article 3, the McLoughlin decision having failed to remedy the deficiencies identified in Vinter. The Court of Appeal had proceeded on the incorrect assumption that the European Court was mistaken in its analysis of domestic law. Consequently, McLoughlin had merely sought to correct that perceived error, without developing the de jure situation. The review of whole life sentences was still based on a vague discretion vested in a Government minister. He considered that the Court should now rule that such a function must be entrusted to judges not politicians, this proposition finding clear support in the relevant international and comparative materials referred to in Vinter, and being implicit in the Vinter reasoning itself. He drew an analogy in this respect with the evolution that took place both in domestic case-law and Convention case-law requiring the removal of any role for the executive in the determination of sentences. Even if executive review could still be accepted in principle, the domestic system was deficient since the review was conducted by a partisan political figure, as illustrated by public remarks made by the then-Secretary of State following the McLoughlin decision. The procedure therefore did not offer any prospect of fairness, balance and certainty.\n29. The McLoughlin decision had indicated that the statutory terminology was to be given a broad meaning, but this should not be regarded as sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 3, as laid down in Vinter and subsequent judgments of this Court. The meaning of the terms \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d had not been elucidated. Greater specificity was required for the sake of legal certainty; without it, a prisoner\u2019s motivation to attempt rehabilitation would be completely undermined. The only detailed point of reference for whole life prisoners remained the Lifer Manual, the restrictive wording of which had been criticised in Vinter.\n30. Concerning the timing of the review, this issue was still affected by legal uncertainty. It was not stipulated in any legal provision, and had not been addressed in the McLoughlin decision. Whole life prisoners had no clarity as to when their sentences would be reviewed. The applicant recalled that prior to 2003, such sentences were systematically reviewed after twenty-five years, and that the proposal had been made in Parliament (a proposal put forward by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2013 and debated in the House of Lords in 2014) to reintroduce this practice via legislation. The Court\u2019s post-Vinter cases confirmed that a specific timeframe must be provided for in domestic law. Were the Court to now find no violation of Article 3, this would cause chaos in the relevant Convention case-law.\n31.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 33-39, 4 May 2006.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that his detention was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n...\u201d\n15. The Court notes, however, that the applicant\u2019s detention was based on Article 258 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that he was detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed a serious offence (see paragraph 7 above). It accordingly finds that the decision to place the applicant in custody had a legal basis and was issued by the competent judicial authority. There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined or, therefore, lacked the degree of foreseeability required by the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Moreover, the Court does not discern any appearance of arbitrariness in the decisions of the relevant judicial authorities on the applicant\u2019s detention. It also observes that the lawfulness of the detention was repeatedly reviewed by the competent domestic courts (see Malik v. Poland, no. 57447/00, \u00a7 26, 4 April 2006).\n16. Against that background, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention simultaneously.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about unfairness of the proceedings in that he had been convicted despite being innocent. However, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law ...\u201d\n19. The Court finds that the applicant did not file a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against the final judgment of the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court of 26 September 2006.\n20. In that regard, the Court observes that under Polish law and in accordance with the practice of the Supreme Court a cassation appeal can be brought by a party alleging a flagrant breach of any sub", "001-93304": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASES OF WALTO\u015a and PAWLICZ v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n13. A detailed rendition of the provisions of the relevant domestic law is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, ECHR 2007\u2011...\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n14. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all relevant domestic remedies as required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that neither at the appellate nor at the cassation stage had the applicant alleged, even in substance, any infringement of his right to a fair hearing as presented in his subsequent complaint to the Court. In particular, the applicant had not questioned the alleged restrictions on his access to the case file and on taking notes from it. Nor had he complained that he could not present his arguments in accordance with the principles of an adversarial hearing and equality of arms.\n15. The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. Had the applicant been of the opinion that the legal provisions on which the courts had based their decisions or their interpretation \u2013 namely Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in conjunction with section 52 \u00a7 2 of the Lustration Act \u2013 had breached his rights, in particular his right to a fair hearing enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution, he should have lodged a constitutional complaint. In particular, the applicant should have requested the Constitutional Court to examine whether the rules imposed by those provisions had violated his right to a fair trial.\n16. The Government further submitted that the application had been lodged outside the time-limit of six months as the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case had been given on 1 February 2007 while he had lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007.\n17. The applicant disagreed. He submitted that the rules governing access to the case file and the manner in which the lustration proceedings had been conducted could not have been effectively challenged in an appeal or cassation appeal as they were provided for by the domestic law. As regards the constitutional complaint, he submitted that it had been an extraordinary remedy which he had not been obliged to exhaust. Finally, he submitted that the decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007, and that he had lodged his application with the Court within less than six months from that date. The applicant provided a copy of an envelope from the Supreme Court, and a delivery receipt, confirming that the reasoned decision of the Supreme Court of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n18. The Court firstly observes that it has already found that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applied to lustration proceedings (see, Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, ECHR 2006\u2011... and Bobek v. Poland (dec.), no. 68761/01, 24 October 2006).\n19. The Court also considers that the question of whether the applicant could effectively challenge the set of legal rules governing access to the case file and setting out the features of the lustration proceedings is linked to the Court\u2019s assessment of Poland\u2019s compliance with the requirements of a \u201cfair trial\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Matyjek v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 42, Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, \u00a7 46, 15 January 2008).\n20. The Court accordingly joins the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to the merits of the case.\n21. The Court further notes that the Government alleged that the applicant had introduced his application out of time and that it should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. However, the Court observes that it appears from the documents provided by the applicant that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision, the object and purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment (see Worm v. Austria, \u00a7 33, 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007 thus within less than six months from the date of notification. It could not be therefore said that the application was introduced out of time. The Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.\n22. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the lustration proceedings had been unfair. Article 6 of the Convention provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ...by [a] ... tribunal...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\n(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.\u201d\n#### A. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n24. The applicant argued that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected in his case. He had been hindered in his access to the case file and thus could not defend himself properly against the allegations raised by the Commissioner of the Public Interest.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. On 3 July 2008 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 15,000 (the equivalent of approx. EUR 4,600). The Government invited the Court to strike out the application in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n23. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. She maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n24. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n25. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof.

The applicant generally contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n23. The Court notes that the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings under the 2004 Act and the Warsaw Regional Curt confirmed on 16 November 2004 that the proceedings had been lengthy.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 13 February 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant constitutional provisions\n13. Article 41 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cInviolability and liberty of the person shall be afforded to everyone. Any deprivation or limitation of liberty may be imposed only in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down by statute.\u201d\n#### B. Conditional release of a person serving a prison sentence\n14. Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the 1997 Criminal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cThe court may conditionally release a person serving a prison sentence from serving the remainder of that sentence only when his/her behaviour, characteristics, personal circumstances and way of life prior to the commission of the offence, the circumstances in which the offence was committed and his/her behaviour following the commission of the offence and while serving a sentence, would justify a conclusion that, following [conditional] release, the person would abide by the law and, in particular, would not re-offend.\u201d\nArticle 78 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the Criminal Code prescribes the minimum prison term, depending on the type of sentence and offender, which must be served before a convicted person may apply for conditional release. However, the decision to grant conditional release is left to the discretion of the court, which must be satisfied that the conditions laid down in Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code are met.\n#### C. Execution of a decision granting conditional release\n15. When conditional release is granted, a convicted person should be released on completion of the necessary administrative formalities as specified in the Ordinance (Zarz\u0105dzenie) of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 on Administrative Acts concerning Execution of Pre-Trial Detention and Sentences and Coercive Measures resulting in Deprivation of Liberty.\nParagraph 3 of that Ordinance states, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cAll administrative formalities shall be carried out without delay (niezw\u0142ocznie) ... This concern in particular (...) transmission of information and official notifications ... and releasing.\u201d\nParagraph 104.2 of the Ordinance provides that the convicted person should be released upon receipt of a copy of the enforceable decision granting him or her the conditional release. The release should be effected on the day of the receipt of the relevant documents by the prison (\u00a7 104.3 of the Ordinance).\nThe Ordinance does not prescribe any specific time-frame for the execution of the decisions granting conditional release.\n#### D. The State's liability for torts committed by its officials\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the State's liability for torts committed by its officials are set out in paragraphs 34-37 of the Court's judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, ECHR 2005\u2013V (extracts).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained about a delay of over 48 hours in his release from prison following the final decision granting him conditional release given by the Court of Appeal in the morning of 12 April 2000. He relied on Article 5 of the Convention, which reads, in its relevant part, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n...\u201d\n18. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The arguments of the parties\n20. The applicant submitted that on 12 April 2000 at 9 a.m. the Cracow Court of Appeal had upheld the Regional Court's decision granting him conditional release. The applicant argued that he should have been released on the same day, given that the distance between Cracow and Tarn\u00f3w was only about 100 km. Nevertheless, he had been released from prison only on 14 April 2000 at 4 p.m.\n21. The Government submitted that the Convention permitted deprivation of liberty only in those cases which were enumerated in Article 5 and only in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention provided for the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 October 1993 and 21 February 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Penal Code\n18. Pursuant to Article 1 in Chapter 1 of the Penal Code (brottsbalken):\n\u201cA crime (brott) is constituted by any act for which the present code or other Law or Statute provides punishment (straff) as stated below.\u201c\nAccording to Article 3, a reaction to crime (p\u00e5f\u00f6ljd f\u00f6r brott) is understood in the code to mean the ordinary forms of punishment, notably fines and imprisonment.\n#### B. Offences against the good order of court proceedings\n19. Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, as applicable at the material time, read:\n\u201cA person who, at a court sitting, disturbs the proceedings or takes photographs in the courtroom, or fails to comply with directions or prohibitions imposed under Chapter 5, Article 9, shall be ordered to pay a fine. The same punishment (straff) may be imposed on a person who, in his oral or written observations to the court, expresses himself in an improper manner.\u201c\nChapter 5, Article 9, provides inter alia that the presiding judge may order a person who disturbs the proceedings or behaves in an improper manner to leave the courtroom.\n20. Fines imposed under Article 5 could not exceed 1,000 Swedish kronor (Article 9 in Chapter 9, as applicable at the relevant time), unlike ordinary criminal-law fines which were income-based.\n21. The question as to which court has jurisdiction in cases concerning offences against the good order of court proceedings (r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsf\u00f6rseelser) is governed by Article 5 in Chapter 19 - \u201cPart II. On the procedure in criminal cases\u201c (\u201cII. Om r\u00e4ttegangen i brottm\u00e5l\u201c) - of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Under this Article it is for the court sitting in the proceedings - whether civil, criminal or other - in which the improper conduct has occurred to examine of its own motion whether it constitutes such an offence.\nArticle 1 in Chapter 20 (Part II of the code) reads:\n\u201cThe court may not examine a question of criminal liability in the absence of a criminal charge. However, it may deal with issues of offences against the good order of court proceedings without a charge being brought.\u201c\nIn the proceedings under consideration, the courts followed the procedure laid down in the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters (lagen om handl\u00e4ggning av domstols\u00e4renden 1946:807 - \u201cthe 1946 Act\u201c). Section 1 provides:\n\u201cThe present Act shall apply to matters relating to the administration of justice with which the ordinary lower courts must deal of their own motion or on application and which, according to statute or other regulation, do not fall to be examined under the procedure provided for in civil or criminal cases; however, it shall not apply to questions of punishment or other consequences of a criminal offence.\u201c\n22. If the court in question finds that a person has contravened Chapter 9, Article 5, it may immediately order him to pay a fine. Such a measure is not entered in the police register.\n#### C. Oral hearing in proceedings relating to offences against the good order of court proceedings\n23. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 4 of the 1946 Act, a hearing may be held if the court in question considers that the person concerned should be heard orally. Should the court decide to hold one, it is, pursuant to section 5 of the 1946 Act, governed by the same provisions as apply to hearings in civil cases.\n#### D. Conversion of fines\n24.

The applicant complained in the first place that he had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court. The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n12. The Government argued in the first place that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months time-limit. In their view, the six months period should start running from 9 October 2001, the date on which the applicant's police statement was taken. As regards the merits, the Government submitted that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer during his questioning before the investigating judge on 12 October 2001 and thereafter during the subsequent criminal proceedings.\n13. The Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months following the final decision of the Court of Cassation that had been delivered on 10 October 2003, in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 January 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Disability benefits\n12. According to Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act (as in force until 1 January 2001, when the 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance - lagen (1998:703) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force), a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1997 the basic amount was SEK 36,300. In 1983, when the applicant turned 65, it was SEK 19,400.\n13. According to Chapter 9, section 3 of the 1962 Act (as in force at the material time), such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount, depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability.\n#### B. Procedure\n14. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act could form the subject of an appeal to the County Administrative Court, to the Administrative Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n15. The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings shall be in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing (I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas, om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det)\u201d.\nUnder those circumstances it was not possible for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n16. From the case-law of the national courts, it appears that the grounds stated in the third paragraph of section 9 for refusing an oral hearing have been interpreted as being alternative rather than cumulative (see Regeringsr\u00e4ttens \u00c5rsbok 1997 ref 62).\n17. According to the preparatory work to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing could be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and could benefit the examination of a case, in particular in two situations: firstly, when it was necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it was difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case needed to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a supplement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\nIt was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party's request for an oral hearing should be given close consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing was necessary was to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. However, other circumstances could be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party's understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case was of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the value of what was at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing in his case, including the fact that he was denied an opportunity to have witnesses called to give evidence on his behalf, constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, he complained under this provision that the competent courts had failed to carry out an examination of the merits of his Article 6 \u00a7 1 complaint. In so far as is relevant this provision reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government disputed the above complaints and invited the Court to declare them inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. In any event, they submitted, there had been no violation of the Convention in this case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. In so far as the applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court considers that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n21. In so far as the applicant alleges a further violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the alleged failure of the national courts to deal with his above complaint about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court notes that his allegation is not actually borne out by the facts. His claim that the County Administrative Court's refusal to hold an oral hearing had violated Article 6 \u00a7 1 was first entertained by the Administrative Court of Appeal, when refusing to hold a hearing and to grant him leave to appeal. Subsequently, the Supreme Administrative Court did consider the matter, as is evident from the information given to him on that occasion. This complaint must therefore be declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Merits of the complaint about the lack of an oral hearing\n##### 1. The applicant's submissions\n22. The applicant maintained that there were no exceptional reasons capable of justifying the refusal to grant him an oral hearing. His appeal against the Social Insurance Office's decision had raised both issues of fact and of law. These could not be determined solely on the basis of the medical records and opinions, since his claim for disability benefits was based not solely on his reduced functional capacity but also on his need for assistance and on the extra costs he had incurred. At an oral hearing the applicant would have been able to supplement the evidence by explaining his medical condition and its consequences in his daily life before he had reached the age of 65. Moreover, it would have enabled the national courts to put supplementary questions on these aspects to the applicant and to the witnesses he had requested be heard.\n##### 2. The Government's submissions\n23. The Government were of the view that there were exceptional circumstances in this particular case that justified dispensing with an oral hearing.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 October 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Employment Rights Act 1996\n23. Under section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer. By section 98(1), an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section 98(2), which includes \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201csome other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held\u201d.\nSection 98(4) deals with fairness:\n\u201cWhere the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection (1), the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to the reason shown by the employer) \u2013\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer\u2019s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.\u201d\n24. However, paragraph 106 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) Section 94 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than one year ending with the effective date of termination.\u201d\n25. Section 108(3) of the Employment Rights Act provides a wide variety of exceptions from the one-year qualifying period, many of which derive from the United Kingdom\u2019s implementation of European Community legislation in the field of employment. These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave, refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998, or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer. Moreover, applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race, sex or religion are also exempt from the one-year qualifying period.\n#### B. The Race Relations Act 1976\n26. Section 1 (1) (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 states the following:\n\u201cA person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-\n(a) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u201d\nSection 1 A of the Race Relations Act 1976 states:\n\u201c A person also discriminates against another if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection (IB), he applies to that other provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but\n(a) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons;\n(b) which puts that other at that disadvantage, and\n(c) which he cannot show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 10 AND 11 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained of a violation of his rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. He submitted that, in choosing to become a member of the BNP and to stand for election, he was engaging both his right to freedom of expression pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention and his right to freedom of assembly and association pursuant to Article 11 and that his dismissal had disproportionately interfered with his exercise of those rights.\n28. Article 10 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n29. Article 11 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\n2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.\u201d\n30. The Government contested these arguments.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n32. As the Court has noted, the applicant relies on both Article 10 and Article 11 of the Convention. However, the Court considers it more appropriate to examine his complaints under Article 11 of the Convention, but it will do so in the light of Article 10.\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n33. The applicant submitted that for an employee to lose his job for exercising his right to freedom of association struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of that right. Consequently, he contended that the Government had a positive obligation under Article 11 of the Convention to enact legislation which would have afforded him protection from the termination of his employment by Serco on the ground of his involvement with the BNP. However, since he had less than one year\u2019s qualifying service, he was unable to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n34. The applicant submitted that fundamental rights must be effective and available from the first day of employment. While he understood that it might be appropriate to allow an employer a certain time in which to assess the conduct or capability of an employee, he argued that this should not apply in relation to discrimination on protected grounds. In fact, he submitted that freedom of association would be illusory if it could only be exercised after a certain period of service.\n35. The applicant further submitted that even if he had had more than one year\u2019s qualifying service, his employer would have been able to rely on his political involvement as being \u201csome other substantial reason\u201d to justify the termination of his employment.\n(b) The Government\n36. The Government contended that Article 11 did not impose any positive obligation to enact legislation of the kind suggested by the applicant. They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State\u2019s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of the right or freedom concerned (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 44, S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006\u2011I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State\u2019s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected \u201cto have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers\u201d.\n37.

Practice Direction (Crime: Defence Costs) [1999] 1 WLR 1832, which was in force at the time of the applicant's trial, provided that:\n\u201cWhere a person is not tried for an offence for which he has been indicted or committed for trial or has been acquitted on any count in the indictment, the court may make a defendant's costs order. Such an order should normally be made whether or not an order for costs inter partes is made, unless there are positive reasons for not doing so, as where, for example, the defendant's own conduct has brought suspicion on himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him is stronger than it is.\u201d\n11. As noted above, no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal against a refusal of a defendant's costs order.\n12.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that his detention on remand exceeded the reasonable time requirement. He also contended that he had no effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of his detention on remand. In respect of his complaints the applicant relied on Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 13 of the Convention. However, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s second complaint should be examined from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4, rather than Article 13.\n17. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention provides as relevant:\nArticle 5 \u00a7 3\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\nArticle 5 \u00a7 4\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n##### 1. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued that, as the applicant had lodged his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on 17 February 2004, the time he had spent in detention between 10 March 1998 and 21 March 2001 should be rejected for having been introduced outside the six-month time-limit laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1.\n19. The Court refers to the principles adopted in the Solmaz v. Turkey judgment (no. 27561/02, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2007\u2011... (extracts)), where it held that, if the applicant is in effect imprisoned throughout, the multiple, consecutive detention periods should be regarded as a whole and the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period. In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand began when he was arrested on 10 March 1998. He was detained within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention until his conviction by the Istanbul State Security Court on 21 March 2001. As from that date, until 8 August 2001, when the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the first-instance court, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) and, therefore, this part of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3. From 8 August 2001 until his release pending trial on 1 November 2004, the applicant was again in pre-trial detention falling under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions concerning enforcement of payment of the community charge\n19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c).\nThe relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (\u201capplication for a liability order\u201c) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable.\n...\n(5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid.\u201c\nRegulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (\u201clevying of distress\u201c):\n\u201cWhere a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made.\u201c\nRegulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201c(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\n(2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.\n(3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit -\n(a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or\n(b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of the warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.\n...\n(7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ...\u201c\nThe relevant part of Regulation 42 provides:\n(3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed.\u201c\n20. In Regina v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9 October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that \u201cThe proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax.\u201c However, in Regina v. Hebburn Justices, ex parte Martin (31 July 1995, unreported), Mr Justice Sedley in the High Court held that although the initial obligation to pay community charge was a civil one, magistrates \u201cwho have reached the point of committal are entertaining a criminal process\u201c.\n#### B. Appeal from a decision of a magistrates' court by way of case stated\n21. By virtue of section 111 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 a party to proceedings before a magistrates' court may \u201cquestion the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ...\u201c. This is known as the \u201ccase stated\u201c procedure.\n22. Under section 113 of the 1980 Act, magistrates may grant bail to a party who applies to them to state a case; but if they refuse to do so, in cases categorised as \u201ccivil\u201c under the domestic law, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant bail until it is seized of some substantive proceedings to which the grant of bail can be ancillary.\n23. Acts performed pursuant to an order made by a magistrates' court which is subsequently set aside by a superior court are not themselves inherently unlawful. It is at the discretion of the higher court whether these collateral acts are also invalid: Regina v. Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex parte Hague [1992] 1 Appeal Cases 58, 124D-G (per Lord Justice Taylor in the Court of Appeal); London and Clydeside Estates Ltd v. Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 Weekly Law Reports 182, 189C-190C (per Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor, in the House of Lords); Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin PLC [1987] Queen's Bench 815, 840A-C (per Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls).\n#### C. The distinction between an act of a magistrates' court which is merely wrong in law and one which is so wrong as to be in excess of jurisdiction\n24. In English law, orders of a magistrates' court which are in excess of jurisdiction are void from the outset, whereas orders made within jurisdiction remain valid until set aside by a superior court. It is only in respect of the former type of error that a court can be held civilly liable in damages (under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which replaced section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 - see paragraphs 27-28 below).\n25. The appropriate test for whether an order of a magistrates' court is void for lack of jurisdiction is that set out by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan [1985] Appeal Cases 528. In that case magistrates had made an order sending a 14-year-old boy to a training school after a hearing at which he was not legally represented, had not applied for legal aid and had not been informed of his right so to do. The order was quashed on judicial review on the ground that, by virtue of Article 15 (1) of the Treatment of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, magistrates were not permitted to pass a custodial sentence for the first time on a juvenile who was not legally represented, unless he had applied for legal aid and been refused on grounds of means or had been informed of his right to apply for it but had refused or neglected to do so.\nThe boy then applied for damages for false imprisonment against the magistrates. Since the case was decided prior to the enactment of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and at a time when it was the law that magistrates were liable in damages for false imprisonment if they acted in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 26 below), the House of Lords was required to decide the jurisdictional question.\nIn its judgment, a magistrates' court acted in excess of jurisdiction in three circumstances only: (1) if it acted without having jurisdiction over the cause, (2) if it exercised its powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or (3) if it made an order that had no proper foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent. The instant case fell within the third limb of the rule: the magistrates were liable in damages because they had not observed the requirements of Article 15 (1) of the 1976 Order.\nDuring the course of his judgment speech, Lord Bridge commented (at page 546 E-F), on the jurisdiction of magistrates in conducting a criminal trial:\n\u201c... once justices have duly entered upon a summary trial of a matter within their jurisdiction, only something quite exceptional occurring in the course of their proceeding to a determination can oust their jurisdiction ... [A]n error (whether of fact or law) in deciding a collateral issue on which jurisdiction depends will not do so. Nor will the absence of any evidence to support a conviction ...\u201c\n26. The final limb of the rule formulated by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan (that is, that magistrates exceed their jurisdiction when they make an order which has no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent) was applied by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies [1989] 1 All England Reports 30, a case concerning rates (the predecessor to the community charge). Again, the issue was whether magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction and were therefore liable in damages for false imprisonment.\nThe plaintiff had been unable to pay all of the rates for which he became liable in December 1984, and in January 1986 he failed to follow his accountant's advice to close his business and to go bankrupt. Applying legislation similar to Regulation 41 of the Community Charge Regulations, the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant's advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison. The Court of Appeal held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow advice in 1986 and the failure to pay the rates in 1984, and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry (as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect) required by the legislation as a condition precedent of the warrant of commitment. They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages.\nThe three Appeal Court judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms. Lord Justice O'Connor observed that \u201cthey never carried out the inquiry required [by the law]\u201c; Lord Justice Neill found that \u201csome inquiry about the applicant's finances was made\u201c, but that \u201ca clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out. The justices never examined the question whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect\u201c; and Sir Roger Ormrod (who dissented from the majority decision) said: \u201c... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant's failure to pay his rates was `due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect'\u201c (see pp. 637 B, 642 H-643 G and 647 E).\n#### D. The immunity of magistrates from civil proceedings\n27. Magistrates enjoy a statutory immunity from civil liability in certain circumstances. Before the coming into force of section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 on 1 January 1991, this immunity was provided for by sections 44 and 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In brief, a magistrate was liable in damages for acts done by him in his official capacity if it could be proved either (1) that the act was done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause or (2) that it was performed outside or in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 25 above ", "001-57642": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF DARBY v.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 May 1990 and on 24 September 1990,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Taxation in general\n17. The provisions regarding municipal income taxation in general are included in the Municipal Tax Act 1928, which has been amended on numerous occasions over the years. The references below to this Act and to other enactments are all to the version in force during the relevant period (1979-1981), unless otherwise stated.\n18. Liability to pay tax in Sweden was regulated in section 53, subsection 1, of the Municipal Tax Act: residents of Sweden were taxed on their world-wide income whereas non-residents had a more limited liability, covering, inter alia, income derived from employment in the Swedish public service.\nUnder Article 19 of the convention with Finland for the avoidance of double taxation (published in svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling (\u201cSFS\u201c - the official journal), 1977:812), the right to tax income derived from public service vested in the State which paid the remuneration (with certain exceptions not relevant here).\n19. Regarding the place of taxation in Sweden, section 59, subsections 1 and 3, of the Municipal Tax Act provided that income earned by a resident from employment was to be taxed in the municipality where he was formally registered as a resident (mantalsskriven).\nAccording to the Tax (Common Municipal Purposes) Act (lag om skatt f\u00f6r gemensamt kommunal \u00e4ndam\u00e5l), income earned by a non-resident from employment in, inter alia, the Swedish public service was to be taxed in Stockholm in the so-called Common District. The tax rate (10 per cent) applicable in this district was lower than the ordinary municipal tax rate. The tax levied was not destined for any specific municipality but was used for levelling out the burden of taxation between different municipalities or other administrative authorities. It did not include any tax payable to the Church of Sweden.\n20. As a result of an amendment to section 68 of the Municipal Tax Act and subsection 1 of the instructions relating to section 66 of the same Act (SFS 1978:925), certain non-residents were considered, with effect from 1 January 1979, to have sufficient connection with Sweden to be liable to pay the full municipal tax. The Government Bill (1978/79:58) containing these amendments did not mention the problems which might result for non-residents in relation to the Dissenters Tax Act.\nHenceforth, a non-resident with certain types of income, such as that derived from employment in the public service, and with a temporary abode in Sweden was no longer taxed in the Common District but in the municipality where he had first lived. This meant that he had to pay municipal tax at the same rate as a resident and also church tax.\n#### B. The church tax\n21. The church tax is collected together with the ordinary municipal tax. The rate is determined by the local parish council. This system has a long tradition and is based on the fact that the Lutheran Church of Sweden is the established church. Under the transitional provisions of the 1974 Constitution (regeringsformen), its parishes have a status similar to that of the municipalities - including the right of taxation.\n22.

A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant alleged in particular that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained that the national courts had based their decisions on his police statement which had been taken under duress. Finally, he argued that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time. In this respect he invoked Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention.\n#### A. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicant was complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court, he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 27 November 1997.\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined in several cases similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six months\u2019 rule and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003 and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instance case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n20. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n21. In the light of its established case law (see, amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raise complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Independence and impartiality of the State Security Court\n22.

The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n12.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained that the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. The applicant relied on Article 6 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Government suggested that, since the applicant had been acquitted in 2004, he could no longer be considered a victim. The Government invited the Court to strike the application out of the Court's list of cases in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n17. The applicant disagreed with the Government's arguments and maintained his complaints.\n18. The Court reiterates that \u201ca decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a 'victim' unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention\u201d (see Dalban v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Unemployment benefits\n14. A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance. The main regulations in this area are given in the Unemployment Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets-f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, SFS 1997:238; hereafter \u201cthe 1997 Act\u201c) and the Unemployment Funds Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor, SFS 1997:239). Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and State funding. A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit, a so-called basic insurance. Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment, that is he or she has worked a certain number of months before becoming unemployed, and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions, for example, he or she must actively be looking for work. At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of days. After that, a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits.\n15. According to Section 45(a) of the 1997 Act, the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary, without acceptable reasons, rejects suitable work or if he or she, without having expressly rejected the work, by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised. The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits. According to Section 46, the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme (arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program). Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in the 1997 Act can be appealed against to the administrative courts.\n#### B. The activity guarantee scheme and activity support\n16. The activity guarantee scheme was one of several different labour market policy programmes. The scheme ceased to be in force on 2 July 2007. According to Sections 8 and 21 of the 2000 Ordinance, a person could (the word \u201cmay\u201d (f\u00e5r) was used in the Ordinance) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was at least 20 years old, was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service. Section 6 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and, thus, an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective. Moreover, Section 7 stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy.\n17. A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits. His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support (f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d, SFS 1996:100). Section 23 of the 1997 Act stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining days of unemployment benefits. In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining days of unemployment benefits, \u201csince the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 54).\n18. The Ordinance on Activity Support stated that a person who took part in, inter alia, the activity guarantee scheme was entitled to economic support. According to Section 5 of the Ordinance, a person who was or would have been entitled to unemployment benefits or who had received unemployment benefits for the longest period for which benefits could be provided, would be given activity support equivalent to the unemployment benefits he or she would have received under the 1997 Act. A person who was not entitled to benefits as described above would still be given a specific amount per day in activity support. When a person who had been taking part in a programme such as the activity guarantee ceased to be part of it, he or she was no longer entitled to the activity support.\n19. Section 37(a) of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would be revoked if a person assigned to it refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme without an acceptable reason. An assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would also be revoked if the individual did not act in a proper manner or otherwise disrupted the activities. Moreover, an assignment could be revoked if there were other special reasons to do so.\n20. According to Section 37(b) of the 2000 Ordinance, if an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked because the individual had refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, without an acceptable reason, the individual would (the word \u201cshall\u201d (skall) was used in the Ordinance) be reassigned to the activity guarantee scheme after a suspension of 45 days, if certain basic requirements were met. In the Government Bill which preceded the introduction of this provision, the Government noted that the consequences for those who had their assignment to the activity guarantee scheme revoked would be far-reaching unless they had fulfilled a new qualifying period of employment. The Government also observed that the activity guarantee scheme had the character of a last economic protection among the labour market policy measures for those who were, or were at a risk of becoming, unemployed for a long period. Thereafter the Government stated: \u201cThe person applying should therefore in principle have a right to participate in the activity guarantee until he or she finds a solution for his or her unemployment situation, on condition that he or she in an active way contributes to such a solution. ... A person who has had his or her assignment to the activity guarantee revoked on the ground that he or she has refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, shall therefore be offered a new assignment to the guarantee.\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 66)\n21. Decisions regarding the revocation of an assignment to a labour market policy programme, including the activity guarantee scheme, were taken by the County Labour Board. Appeals against the County Labour Board\u2019s decision could be made to the National Labour Market Board. According to Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance, no appeal lay against the National Labour Market Board\u2019s decisions.\n22. In connection with a reorganisation of the Labour Market Administration into the Employment Service, the issue of whether decisions regarding labour market policy programmes should be subject to appeal was considered by the Government. It first stated that there was a right to be assigned to the labour market policy measure called \u201cnew start jobs\u201d (nystartjobb) and then stated, inter alia, the following: \u201cIn the case of other labour market policy measures and financial compensation, assignment decisions to them depend to a great extent on the situation in the labour market. There is no right to receive such a measure and there is no right to retain it either. This means that the decisions to be taken by the new agency in these matters, including the revocation of a measure, do not need to be examined by a court. Nor are the decisions suited to an examination by a court.\u201d (Government Bill 2006/07:89 p 79)\n#### C. Appeals against an authority\u2019s decision\n23. The handling of matters in the Swedish public administration is regulated by the Administrative Procedure Act (f\u00f6rvaltningslagen, SFS 1986:223; hereafter \u201cthe 1986 Act\u201c). Section 3 \u00a7 1, of the 1986 Act states that the provisions in the Act are subsidiary if they differ from the provisions in any other act or ordinance. According to Section 22, a decision may be appealed against by any person whom the decision concerns, provided the decision affects him or her adversely and an appeal against the decision is permitted. Section 22(a) states that appeals are to be made to the administrative courts. The preparatory works (Government Bill 1997/98:101 pp 59 and 112) state that one of the purposes of Section 22(a) is to assign a competent court when a prohibition to appeal against a decision has to be set aside because it would be in violation of the Convention.\n24. On 1 July 2006 a new second paragraph was added to Section 3 of the 1986 Act which states that the provisions on appeal according to the Act should always apply if it is necessary in order to provide for everyone\u2019s right to a fair trial in the determination of their civil rights or obligations as laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. According to the preparatory works (Government Bill 2005/06:56 p 10), one of the reasons for amending the 1986 Act was to make it clear that the 1986 Act\u2019s provisions on appeal applied regardless of what was stated in other acts or provisions, if this was necessary in order to satisfy the right to access to court in accordance with the Convention.\n25. Section 21 \u00a7 2 of the 1986 Act states that an authority has an obligation to inform a party about how to appeal against all decisions that affect the party adversely, if the decision can be appealed against.\n26. In a decision of 22 November 1994 (NJA 1994 p. 657) the Swedish Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen) found that a dispute over agricultural subsidies concerned a civil right in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention and found that a trial before a court should be allowed. Therefore, the court set aside the prohibition to appeal against the authority\u2019s decision. Similarly, the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) has set aside prohibitions to appeal against different authorities\u2019 decisions, when the cases concerned civil rights and obligations (see, for example, decision of 25 November 1997 in R\u00c5 1997 ref. 65 and decision of 30 November 2001 in R\u00c5 2001 ref. 56).\n#### D. The State\u2019s liability to pay damages\n27. It follows from Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, SFS 1972:207) that the State is liable to pay comp", "001-78447": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF WOJTUNIK v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n21. The proceedings began on 1 December 1992 and ended on 28 January 1999. They therefore lasted 6 years, 1 month and 28 days. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect.\n22. The period under the Court\u2019s scrutiny lasted therefore 5 years, 8 months and 29 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n23. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that after 17 September 2004, when the 2004 Act had come into force, the applicant had the possibility of lodging with the Polish civil courts a claim for compensation for damage suffered on account of the excessive length of proceedings under Article 417 of the Civil Code read together with section 16 of the 2004 Act. They maintained that the three-year limitation period for the purposes of a compensation claim in tort based on the excessive length of proceedings could run from a date later than the date on which a final decision in these proceedings had been given.\n24. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n25. The Court observes that in the present case the proceedings at issue ended on 28 January 1999, which is more than three years before the relevant provisions of the 2004 Act read together with the Civil Code became effective. It follows that the limitation period for the State\u2019s liability for tort set out in Article 442 of the Civil Code had expired before 17 September 2004.\n26.

Section 3(5)(a)0 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n17. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n18. A person who has been deported may apply to have the deportation order revoked. Paragraphs 390 to 392 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) provide that:\n\u201c390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will be considered in the light of all the circumstances including the following:\n(i) the grounds on which the order was made;\n(ii) any representations made in support of revocation;\n(iii) the interests of the community, including the maintenance of an effective immigration control;\n(iv) the interests of the applicant, including any compassionate circumstances.\n391. In the case of an applicant who has been deported following conviction for a criminal offence continued exclusion\n(i) in the case of a conviction which is capable of being spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, unless the conviction is spent within the meaning of that Act or, if the conviction is spent in less than 10 years, 10 years have elapsed since the making of the deportation order; or\n(ii) in the case of a conviction not capable of being spent under that Act, at any time, unless refusal to revoke the deportation order would be contrary to the Human Rights Convention or the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\nwill normally be the proper course. In other cases revocation of the order will not normally be authorised unless the situation has been materially altered, either by a change of circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh information coming to light which was not before, or the appellate authorities or the Secretary of State. The passage of time since the person was deported may also in itself amount to such a change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.\n392. Revocation of a deportation order does not entitle the person concerned to re\u2011enter the United Kingdom; it renders him eligible to apply for admission under the Immigration Rules. Application for revocation of the order may be made to the Entry Clearance Officer or direct to the Home Office.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant submitted that his deportation to Nigeria violated his right to respect for his family and private life under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties' submissions\n22. The applicant submitted that prior to his deportation he enjoyed family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention with his spouse, his three children and with his grandchild. He had co-habited with his spouse since 1980 and they have been married for twenty-two years. Their three children were born in the United Kingdom and have always lived in the family home. Even though the eldest child was an adult when the applicant was deported, he was not an independent person who had started his own family life. Rather, he was a student who still lived in the family home and who depended financially and emotionally on his parents. His daughter lived with him and prior to the applicant's deportation he relied on both of his parents to help him raise her while he pursued his studies. Following his deportation he relied solely on his mother.\n23. The applicant submitted that his deportation interfered with his right to respect for his family life because his family was split up without any prospect of being reunited in the near future. Relocation was not an option for the family because his teenage children were British nationals who were being educated in the United Kingdom. His eldest son had a child of his own in the United Kingdom. The applicant's wife could not relocate with the applicant because she had to stay to take care of the children and to help raise her grandchild. The only communication which the applicant had had with his family following his deportation was via telephone and written communication.\n24. The applicant accepted that the interference with his right to respect for his family and private life was in accordance with the law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. He argued, however, that it was not necessary in a democratic society. He relied on the official risk assessment report prepared by the Probation Service, which indicated that he posed a low risk of reoffending.\n25. The applicant further relied on the judgment of the Grand Chamber in \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, ECHR 2006\u2011XII. With regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence, he submitted that the only relevant offence was the one which the deportation order specifically held as the basis for the deportation, namely the sexual assault committed on 1 November 2005. As the Secretary of State for the Home Department was fully apprised of the applicant's previous offending and immigration history when he exercised his discretion to grant him Indefinite Leave to Remain in 2005, he could not now rely on his earlier offences in order to justify the decision to deport him. If considered in isolation, the applicant submitted that the sexual assault was not sufficiently serious to warrant deportation. In particular, he submitted that the sentence imposed for this offence, being less than two years, would not have resulted in a decision to deport under the policies in place at the time. This was reflected in the fact that the sentencing judge did not recommend deportation.\n26. The applicant indicated that prior to his deportation he had l", "001-59853": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF DEVLIN v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Devlin v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr W. Fuhrmann,\nMr L. Loucaides,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr K. Traja,\nMr M. Ugrekhelidze, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 April and 9 October 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. By virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment.\n16. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act (as amended by the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989), a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n17. Section 42 of the 1976 Act (as amended) provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub-section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\n18. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended by the 1976 Act) provides as follows in section 19:\n\u201c(1) Subject to sub-section (4) below it shall be unlawful for a Minister of the Crown ... and any authority or body listed ... in ... Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 ... to discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate, in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. ...\n(4) This section does not apply to any act or omission which is unlawful by virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 or would be unlawful but for some exception made by virtue of Part V of that Act.\u201d\n19. Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 lists the departments and authorities subject to investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner. The list includes the Northern Ireland Civil Service Commission and all Government Departments, including the Department of Finance and Personnel. However, section 42 of the 1976 Act falls within Part V of that Act. Accordingly, where a section 42 certificate has been issued (claiming an act was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order), section 19(1) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended) has no effect.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant complained that he had been deprived of the right to have his claim under the Fair Employment Act determined by a court, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n21. The applicant submitted that the present case concerned the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in the job market, which right was as such a \u201ccivil\u201d right falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He was not claiming a right of access to the civil service but a right of equal treatment. There was a civil right at stake in the proceedings brought by him in the Fair Employment Tribunal and Article 6 was applicable.\n22. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they arose out of his unsuccessful application for a civil service post and therefore did not concern the determination of a \u201ccivil\u201d right. The Government quoted the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area which recognised the special status accorded in Contracting States to public servants and, in", "001-60793": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF RADAJ v.

Nielsen, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 7 November 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. The situation of persons detained on remand was at the relevant time governed by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1969. Under Article 89, all correspondence of a detainee was to be opened, read and, if need be, subject to censorship, unless a prosecutor and a court decided otherwise. No provision of the Code provided for any remedy to contest the manner or scope of the censorship of a detainee\u2019s correspondence.\n13. The rights of persons detained on remand as regards their correspondence were further set out in Section 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand. They provided that the correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to screening by prison authorities and by authority conducting the criminal proceedings, i.e. either a public prosecutor or a court, depending on the stage reached in the proceedings.\n14. On 6 July 1997 a new Code of Enforcement of Criminal Sentences was enacted by parliament. Article 102 of this Code, which entered into force on 1 January 1998, provides that the convicted persons are entitled to uncensored correspondence with the State authorities and with the Ombudsman. Article 103 of the Code further provides that convicted persons and their lawyers may lodge complaints with the international agencies established under international treaties on protection of human rights, ratified by Poland. Prisoners\u2019 correspondence in such cases shall be dispatched with no delay and is not subject to censorship.\n15. Pursuant to Article 512 of the new Code, the rights of persons detained on remand shall, in principle, be the same as those of persons convicted by a final judgment.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that, while he was detained on remand, his correspondence with the organs of the European Convention of Human Rights had been intercepted, opened and read by the domestic authorities. He invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which in its relevant part reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect fo", "001-90967": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF NICOLA v.

Turkey,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nNicolas Bratza, President,\nLech Garlicki,\nLjiljana Mijovi\u0107,\nDavid Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson,\nJ\u00e1n \u0160ikuta,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nI\u015f\u0131l Karaka\u015f, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 6 January 2009,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 25 May 1992, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His son, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s son can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Loukas Nicola (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n16. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that since July 1974 Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n18. The Government disputed this claim.\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n19. The Government submitted that the property claimed by the applicant was situated outside the jurisdiction of Turkey and that the latter had no knowledge about it. In any event, the applicant had not produced any evidence supporting his claim to ownership. His house in Trypimeni village had not been occupied or used by the Turkish army. Moreover, the applicant had not applied through the proper channels to visit his alleged property. He had not even attempted to enter the northern part of Cyprus at an approved crossing point, and had not been prevented from doing so by Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces. He had been stopped on the southern side of the buffer zone by UNFICYP. The Turkish forces had not been involved in the incident.\n20. Finally, the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights could not be seen in isolation from the general political situation on the island of Cyprus and had been in any event justified in the general interest.\n##### 2. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that he had produced a photocopy of the original title deed of ownership of his house in Trypimeni. He relied on the principles laid down by the Court in the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment ((merits) of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI) and recalled that on 9 December 1990 he had been prevented from returning to his property.\n#### B. The third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n22. The Government of Cyprus observed that their department of Lands and Surveys had provided certificates confirming ownership to those persons who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title was entered in District Land Offices registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The authorities of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d) were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.\n23. The Government of Cyprus further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou ((merits), cited above), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n24. The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above) provide prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the property at issue. As the respondent Government failed to produce convincing evidence in rebuttal, the Court considers that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n25. The Court recalls that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64), it reasoned as follows:\n\u201c63. ... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy, her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.\n64. Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights which is imputable to Turkey.\nIt has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.\nNor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d\n26. In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (\u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189):\n\u201c187. The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cyp", "001-87466": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF FIGIEL v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII, and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. On 30 July 2007 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 10,000 (the equivalent of EUR 2,600) in respect of the two cases introduced by the applicant (see paragraphs 4 and 9 above). The Government invited the Court to strike out the applications in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n12. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. He maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n13. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n14. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof. The Court will have regard in this connection to the compatibility of the amount with its own awards in similar length of proceedings cases, bearing in mind the principles which it has developed for d", "001-94421": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ERKU\u015e v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. Article 72 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Law on Military Service stipulate that every male citizen of the Republic of Turkey shall fulfil his military service.\n16. Pursuant to section 80 \u00a7 1 of the Law on Military Service, those who have deserted their headquarters or who have exceeded their period of leave or medical leave shall be searched for, arrested and placed in the custody of the local military authorities in order to be handed over to their army commands.\n17. Section 66 of the Military Criminal Code is entitled \u201cdesertion\u201d. Paragraph 1 (b) of this provision makes it a criminal offence to exceed one\u2019s period of leave by six days without authorisation.\n18. Under section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure applicable at the time of the events, the period a person can spend in custody shall not exceed forty-eight hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court. Under section 80 \u00a7 5, if the arrestee cannot be brought before a military court within the time-limit specified in section 80 \u00a7 3, he or she shall be taken to the nearest magistrates\u2019 court. No one shall be deprived of his or her liberty beyond this time-limit.\n19. On 29 June 2006 section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure was amended by Law no. 5530, which provided that time in custody shall not exceed twenty-four hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court, and that the time necessary for transfer could not be more than twelve hours.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that his detention had been unlawful and excessively long and that the authorities had failed to initiate an investigation into the matter. He relied on Articles 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 and 13 of the Convention.\n22. The Court considers that these complaints should be examined solely from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (b), (c) and 3, which provide as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...\n(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non- compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\n3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n23. The Government maintained that the applicant had not been deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. In this connection, they submitted that he had been kept under surveillance in the Izmir Military Recruitment Office for the sole purpose of ensuring his transfer ", "001-82750": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PI\u0104TKIEWICZ v.

The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS FOR PAYMENT\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings for payment had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 May 1991. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 16 December 1999. It thus lasted 6 years, 7 months and 17 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government raised a preliminary objection that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies available to him under Polish law, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that from 17 September 2004, the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act, the applicant had a possibility of seeking compensation for damage resulting from the excessive length of proceedings before the Polish courts, under section 16 of the 2004 Act read in conjunction with Article 417 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the applicant had lodged such a civil claim which had been examined on the merits at two instances and is pending before the Supreme Court.\n22. The applicant contested that argument and submitted that he had exhausted all available domestic remedies. In addition he argued that a claim for compensation under Article 417 of the Civil Code was not an effective remedy; nevertheless, he had attempted to make use of it, to no avail.\n23. The Court has already examined whether after 18 December 2001 and prior to the entry into force of the 2004 Act a compensation claim in tort as provided for by Polish civi", "001-79415": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF AKINTI AND OTHERS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 4 August 2006.\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the censorship of correspondence is stated in the Court\u2019s in the cases of Matwiejczuk v. Poland, no 37641/97, 2 December 2003, and Drozdowski v. Poland, no. 20841/02, 6 December 2005.\n#### B. Relevant statistical data\n18. In the framework of the procedure before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below) the Polish Government supplied statistical data concerning the number and the length of pre-trial detentions ordered in the years 2005-2006 by the domestic courts. A more detailed rendition of the relevant statistical data can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, \u00a7 28, 3 February 2009).\n### III. MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION\n#### A. Recent amendments to the relevant legislation\n19. A number of amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), designed to streamline criminal proceedings, entered into force on 20 June 2007 (Law of 9 May 2007 on amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure; Journal of Laws of 2007, No. 99, item 664; Ustawa o zmianie ustawy - Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw). Those amendments strengthened the powers of the authorities to discipline the parties. A more detailed rendition of the recent amendments to the legislation can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 30-31).\n#### B. Other measures\n20. According to the information supplied by the Polish Government to the Committee of Ministers (see paragraph 23 below), in addition the Polish trial courts and prosecution authorities have undertaken a series of practical measures in order to organise criminal proceedings in a more efficient manner, i.e. by scheduling time-limits for hearings well in advance, holding hearings on Saturdays or severing charges against co-accused to separate proceedings under Article 34 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the joint examination proves difficult and time-consuming.\n21. On 17 May 2007 the Cabinet (Rada Ministr\u00f3w) adopted the \u201cPlan of Actions of the Government for the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland\u201d (Program Dzia\u0142a\u0144 Rzqdu w sprawie wykonywania wyrok\u00f3w Europejskiego Trybuna\u0142u Praw Cz\u0142owieka). By virtue of that document the Minister of Justice was obliged to disseminate among judges and prosecutors on a regular basis information on the standards concerning the length of pre-trial detention stemming from the Convention and the case-law of the Court in Polish cases and to include this topic in the programmes of workshops and seminars for judges.\n### IV. RELEVANT COUNCIL OF EUROPE DOCUMENTS\n#### A. The Committee of Ministers\n22. On 6 June 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted an Interim Resolution concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in 44 cases against Poland relating to the excessive length of detention on remand (\u201cthe 2007 Resolution\u201d). It concluded that the number of the Court\u2019s judgments finding Poland in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on account of the length of pre-trial detention revealed a structural problem. A more detailed rendition of the 2007 Resolution can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7 34)\n#### B. The Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights\n23. On 20 June 2007 the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights released the Memorandum to the Polish Government concerning, among other issues, the use of the pre-trial detention in Poland. The Commissioner referred to the fact that the Court had repeatedly found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of Poland and stressed that examples of cases brought to the Court where pre-trial detention had lasted between 4 to 6 years were not uncommon. The Commissioner urged the Polish authorities to review the application and functioning of pre-trial detention in Polish law. A more detailed rendition of the relevant parts of the memorandum can be found in the above-mentioned Kauczor judgment (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 35).\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n24. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died after the introduction of his application. Subsequently, his mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application introduced by her son. She explained that her son had lived with her in her apartment until his death. She had taken care of him since he had suffered from nervous depression after his stay in detention facilities. She also supported him financially as he had lost his job, home and wife after his arrest. She submitted that her son had needed continual care until his death. Therefore, she had suffered frustration and distress caused, in particular, by her son\u2019s almost three\u2011year\u2011long detention on remand and its consequences.\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s mother cannot be considered a person entitled to pursue the proceedings before the Court on the applicant\u2019s behalf and invited the Court to strike the application out of its list of cases.\n26. The Court recalls that when an applicant dies during the proceedings, the next\u2011of\u2011kin of the applicant has a legitimate interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case (see, for example, Lukanov v. Bulgaria, 20", "001-77991": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OSUCH v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nThe relevant provisions of the domestic law relating to preventive measures are set out in several judgments (see, among others, Jaworski v. Poland, no. 25715/02, \u00a7\u00a7 20-27, 28 March 2006).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and under Article 3 of the Convention that the length of his pre-trial detention was excessive. The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n17. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention lasted from 10 March 1999 to 16 January 2002, when the first-instance judgment was given. Accordingly, the period of his detention amounts to approximately 2 years and 10 months.\n##### 2. The reasonableness of the length of detention\n(a) The parties\u2019 arguments\n18. The Government maintained that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention was not excessive. They stated that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for justifying his detention during the entire period at issue. It was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings, especially in view of the gravity of the charges and the severe penalty that could be expected. The Government drew attention to the fact that the applicant had been charged with membership of an organised criminal group. There was therefore a serious risk that, if released, he would attempt to put pressure on witnesses or obstruct the proceedings.\n19.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n12. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that the length of his detention on remand had been excessive. He further contended under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention that there were no remedies in domestic law to challenge the length of his detention on remand.\n13. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, began when he was taken into police custody on 19 January 1994 and continued until he was convicted by the trial court on 30 July 1997. From 30 July 1997 until his conviction was quashed by the Court of Cassation on 1 March 1999, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and therefore that period of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see Cahit Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 34623/03, \u00a7 34, 14 June 2007 and the cases cited therein). From 1 March 1999 until his conviction by the trial court again on 9 March 2007, however, the applicant was once more in pre-trial detention for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It follows that the applicant spent a total of over eleven years and six months as a remand prisoner.\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n14. The Government argued that there had been a genuine requirement of public interest for the continued detention of the applicant, who had been charged with a serious offence. There had also been a high risk of him escaping and committing further crimes.\n15. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n16. The Court observes that the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court failed to indicate to what extent the applicant\u2019s release would have posed a risk, after \u2013 by then \u2013 well over eleven years of detention (including the periods of imprisonment after conviction),", "001-73360": "\ufeff\nFORMER\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DICKSON v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving regard to the observations of the parties,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n13. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by Section 47 of the Prison Act, 1952, which, in so far as material, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein...\u201d\n14. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n15. The long standing policy of the prison service, set out above in the letter of Secretary of State of 28 May 2003 was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 of age. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n16. They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The Government argued that the policy was justified: (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single parent families.\n17. The Court of Appeal considered, while the first reason did no more than restate the policy, the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy. In giving judgment for the court, Lord Phillips said (at paragraphs 44 ff):\n\u201c[The Secretary of State] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy. I agree. Penal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system.\nFurthermore, [the applicants\u2019] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201cjustified\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustified public concern\u201d. A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern...\n... [the applicants] submitted that [the disadvantage of single parent families] was not a material consideration when formulating prison policy... Again, I do not agree. By imprisoning the husband the State creates the situation where, if the wife is to have a child, that child will, until the husband\u2019s release, be brought up in a single parent family. I consider it legitimate, and indeed desirable, that the State should consider the implications of children being brought up in those circumstances when deciding whether or not to have a general policy of facilitating the artificial insemination of the wives of prisoners or of wives who are themselves prisoners.\nFor those reasons [the applicants have] failed to make out his case that the Secretary of State\u2019s policy only to facilitate artificial insemination in exceptional circumstances is irrational. [The applicants] accepted that there were in this case no exceptional circumstances, and [they were] right to do so.\u201d\n18. For those reasons the court concluded that the policy was not a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 8. Lord Phillips remarked that, for any applicant claiming exceptional circumstances, the normal \u201cstarting point\u201d should be the need to demonstrate that, if facilities for artificial insemination were not provided, conception would not just be delayed but prevented altogether.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained about the refusal of access to artificial insemination facilities and argued that that refusal breached their right to respect for private and family life under Article 8. That Article, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, ... .\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n20. They maintained that the aim of the restriction had to be punishment (as there was no security or other physical or financial barrier) but that, if that was the objective, it would be incoherent to admit of any exceptions to this punitive policy.\n21. In any event, it required considerable justification to take away a fundamental right. Indeed, the starting point of the policy was all wrong: it should be that they had a right to conceive children unless there were compelling reasons against. The applicants relied on the Chamber\u2019s judgment in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) (no. 74025/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 44, ECHR 2004 ...). They maintained that the social factors (the interests of the putative child and of society) underlying the policy and the response to their request by the Secretary of State were not factors contemplated by the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.\n22. In any event, there were insufficient reasons to justify the impugned restriction. A request for artificial insemination did not pose a threat to security. There was no rational link between the offence and the punishment: a person convicted of offences against children could coherently be deprived of parental rights whereas the refusal of the requested facilities indiscriminately (except in exceptional cases) was unjustifiable.\n23. As to the application of the policy in their case, the applicants underlined that a refusal of artificial insemination to them meant that their right to found a family would be extinguished: they could not have a child together given the second applicant\u2019s age, the accepted point of departure for the consideration of a request for artificial insemination. Even if it could be said that the first applicant forfeited some of his rights when he was imprisoned, the same could not be said of the second applicant, a point with which the Court of Appeal and the Government failed to grapple. They disputed the Secretary of State\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient financial provision: the second applicant owned a property worth 200,000 pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d), she was following a course in counselling and, on qualification, she would be able to command an hourly rate of 30 GBP. It was unfair to state that their relationship had not been tested: the strength of any relationship (prisoner or other) was uncertain, there was no link between imprisonment and dissolution of relationship and, indeed, the first applicant\u2019s imprisonment had not weakened their relationship. In any event, this latter argument was circuitous as it could automatically negate any request for artificial insemination from long term prisoners such as the first applicant. It was equally unjust and circular to argue that the first applicant would be initially absent: it was absence for the foreseeable future that rendered the request for artificial insemination necessary \u2013 if the first applicant was to have been shortly released, he would not have needed to make the request.\n24. The Government submitted that the restriction was a punishment the consequences of which were not disproportionate to the aim of maintaining a penal system designed to punish and deter.\nThe policy was consistent with relevant Convention case-law namely, five Commission decisions (No. 6564/74, Dec. 21.5.75, 2 Decision and Reports (\u201cDR\u201d), p. 105; No. 8166/78, Dec. 3.10.78, 13 DR, p. 241; Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Commission report of 13 December 1979, 24 DR, p. 5; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Commission report of 10 July 1980, 24 DR, p. 72; and ELH and PBH v. the United Kingdom, nos. 32094/96 and 32568/96, Commission decision of 22 October 1997, 91A DR, p. 61). The Court of Appeal in the above-cited Mellor case accurately summarised that case-law as containing five principles: the qualifications on the right to respect for family life applied equally to Article 12; imprisonment was incompatible with the exercise of conjugal rights and consequently involved an interference with the right to respect for family life; this restriction was ordinarily justifiable under the provisions of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention; in exceptional circumstances it might be necessary to relax the imposition of detention in order to avoid a disproportionate interference with a particular human right; and there was no Convention jurispru", "001-84379": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OPA\u0141KO v.

The Government did not comment on the merits of the applicant's complaint.\n23. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 January 1992. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 19 April 2006.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained that the domestic proceedings were not concluded within a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, so far as material:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations (...), everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n28. The Government accepted that the relevant period for the purposes of the \u201creasonable time\u201d aspect of the complaint ran from 4 July 1984 until 19 April 1999, a total of fourteen years and nine and a half months. However, they submitted that, although the proceedings were unusually long, only a small proportion of the total delay could be attributed to the State.\nThus, they highlighted the fact that the proceedings were both factually and procedurally complex; the factual complexity was illustrated by, inter alia, the length of the trial, while the insolvency of the defendant companies during the appeal proceedings led to much greater procedural complexity before the Court of Appeal.\n29. The Government also argued that the applicant did not show sufficient diligence in his conduct of the proceedings. In the High Court, he caused delay by entering judgment in default despite knowing that the defendants were in the course of formulating their defence. The claim was vaguely drafted, necessitating a request for Further and Better Particulars, to which the applicant failed to respond in a timely manner. The Summons for Directions was served more than four years late, and the plaintiffs manifestly failed to fulfil their discovery obligations. Furthermore, there were periods in which the applicant took no steps at all to progress the case to trial, and he failed to avail himself in a timely manner of means provided to ensure that the defendants fulfilled their obligations in connection with the proceedings. The trial had to be adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s illness.\nIn the Court of Appeal, there was a delay of one year in providing the court with transcripts of evidence from the trial; to the extent that that delay was attributable to the court reporters, the Government submitted that the State could not be held responsible. The Government also pointed to the fact that the applicant consented to the appeal being stood out of the list following the entry into receivership of Ferranti plc.\n30. The Government referred to the applicant\u2019s allegations of use by the defendants of \u201cdelaying tactics\u201d in the proceedings, and submitted that the State\u2019s obligations in this regard were discharged by the presence of mechanisms allowing the applicant to take action to counter such tactics. The defendants\u2019 applications for security for costs, and their failure to apply to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution, also caused delay for which the Government could not be held responsible.\n31. As for the competent authorities, the Government contended that the High Court made provision for the various hearings required without significant or undue delay, while the Court of Appeal was blameworthy only for the period of delay between 25 March 1997 and 8 April 1998. They accepted that some files in connection with the action were lost by the CAO but submitted that the loss in no way delayed the hearing of the appeal.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 September 1999 and 10 January 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n9. Section 4 of the Bail Act 1976 as amended (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) provided that a person accused of a criminal offence should be granted bail except as stated in Schedule 1 to the Act. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 provided that a defendant need not be granted bail if the court was satisfied that there were substantial grounds for believing that the defendant, if released on bail, would fail to surrender to custody, commit an offence while on bail or\ninterfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to himself or any other person.\n10. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, in taking the above decision, the court was to have regard to such of the following considerations, as well as to any other considerations, as appeared to that court to be relevant:\n\u2013 the nature and seriousness of the offence or default (and the probable method of dealing with the defendant for it);\n\u2013 the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant;\n\u2013 the defendant\u2019s record as regards the fulfilment of his obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; and\n\u2013 except in the case of a defendant whose case was adjourned for inquiries or a report, the strength of the evidence of his having committed the offence or having defaulted.\n11. According to paragraph 9A of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, if a defendant (who had been charged with murder, manslaughter, rape, attempted murder or attempted rape) was granted bail and representations had been made as regards the matters mentioned in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1, the court had to state its reasons for granting bail and cause those reasons to be included in the record of the proceedings.\n12. Section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) came into force on 10 April 1995 and provided as follows:\n\u201c(1) A person who in any proceedings has been charged with or convicted of an offence to which this section applies and in circumstances to which it applies shall not be granted bail in those proceedings.\n(2) This section applies, subject to subsection (3) below, to the following offences, ... \u2013\n(a) murder;\n(b) attempted murder;\n(c) manslaughter;\n(d) rape; or\n(e) attempted rape.\n(3) This section applies to a person charged with or convicted of any such offence only if he has been previously convicted by or before a court in any part of the United Kingdom of any such offence or of culpable homicide and, in the case of a previous conviction of manslaughter or culpable homicide, if he was then sentenced to imprisonment or, if he was then a child or young person, to long-term detention under any of the relevant enactments.\n\u2026\u201d\n13. Section 25 of the 1994 Act has been amended by section 56 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which entered into force on 30 September 1998. Section 56 of the 1998 Act reads as follows:\n\u201cIn subsection (1) of section 25 of the 1994 Act (no bail for defendants charged with or convicted of homicide or rape after previous conviction of such offences), for the words \u2018shall not be granted bail in those proceedings\u2019 there shall be substituted the words \u2018shall be granted bail in those proceedings only if the court or, as the case may be, the constable considering the grant of bail is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances which justify it\u2019.\u201d\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n14. Mr Caballero applied to the Commission on 28 June 1996. He alleged that the automatic denial of bail prior to his trial constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention both taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13. He also claimed that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3.\n15. The Commission declared the application (no. 32819/96) admissible on 1 December 1997. In its report of 30 June 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion, by nineteen votes to twelve, that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and that it was not necessary also to consider the complaint under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. It also expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been no violation of Article 13. The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n16. The Government in their memorial conceded that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. The Government also submitted that, for the reasons set out in the Commission\u2019s report, they considered that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention and that no separate issue arose under Article 14.\n17. The applicant maintained his complaints under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention and under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3.

The Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n15. The Government submitted that the case should be struck out of the Court's list of cases on the ground that the applicant's family were not affected by the alleged violations and could therefore not claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.\n16. The Court reiterates that in a number of cases in which an applicant died in the course of the proceedings, it has taken account of the statements of the applicants' heirs or close family members expressing their wish to pursue the case before the Court (see, among many other authorities, Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Latif Fuat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey, no. 54673/00, \u00a7 27, 2 February 2006; Mutlu v. Turkey, no. 8006/02, \u00a7\u00a7 13\u201314, 10 October 2006). In the present case the Court considers that, apart from having explicitly expressed their wish to do so, the applicant's family have sufficient legitimate interests in obtaining a ruling that the length of the applicant's detention pending trial and the criminal proceedings against him was excessive, in breach of Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. In view of the above, the Court holds that the applicant's family has standing to continue the present proceedings in the applicant's stead. Consequently, the Government's objection that the case should be struck out is dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so\u2011called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 5 provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning the prolongation of detention on remand.\n27. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000\u2011XI, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23, 4 May 2006.\n28. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that the length of his detention on remand had been unreasonable. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n30. The Government refrained from expressing an opinion on whether the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3. The Government submitted, however, that his pre-trial detention was duly justified and that during the entire period the authorities had given relevant and sufficient reasons for prolonging it. Moreover, the Government argued that the domestic courts had acted diligently and speedily, particularly in view of the complexity of the case, which had involved several co\u2011accused.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n32. Under the Court\u2019s case-law, the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in abstracto. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254\u2011A, p. 15, \u00a7 30, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000\u2011XI)\n33. The presumption is in favour of release. As established in Neumeister v. Austria (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 37, \u00a7 4), the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give the judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-...).\n34. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts mentioned ", "001-150778": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HUTCHINSON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, 9 July 2013.\n10. As regards the discretion of the Secretary of State for Justice to release a prisoner sentenced to a whole life order, section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201csection 30\u201d) provides that he may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds. The criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued by the Secretary of State as Prison Service Order 4700 in April 2010.\nChapter 12 of the Lifer Manual, where relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe criteria for compassionate release on medical grounds for all indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISP) are as follows:\n\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stroke;\nand\n\u2022 the risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\n\u2022 further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\n\u2022 there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\n\u2022 early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family.\u201d\n[underlining in the original]\n11. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State, as a public authority, is bound to act compatibly with the scheduled Convention rights, including Article 3. Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act, legislation is to be interpreted so far as it is possible to do so compatibly with the Convention.\n12. A summary of the existing domestic case-law relating to the compatibility of the whole life order scheme with Article 3 of the Convention, notably the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes and Others and the House of Lords judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, was set out in Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58.\n13. The Grand Chamber delivered its judgment in Vinter and Others on 9 July 2013. For reasons discussed in more detail below, it held that there had been a violation of Article 3 in relation to the whole life orders imposed on the applicants because, given the lack of clarity in domestic law concerning the existence of an Article 3-compliant review mechanism, it appeared that the sentences were irrreducible. Following the Vinter and Others judgment, a special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge, to consider three appeals by defendants on whom whole life orders had been imposed and a reference by the Attorney-General in a case where it was contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in this case, R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim 188 was delivered on 18 February 2014. On the question whether whole life orders were reducible and thus compliant with Article 3, the Court of Appeal held:\n\u201c25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of s.30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under s.30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u2018At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u2019\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of s.30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u2018The fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his s.30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to s.30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u2019\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that s.30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u2018At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under s.30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional rel", "001-58409": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MOORE AND GORDON v.

The relevant provisions of the Air Force Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the Coyne case (the Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1848-52, \u00a7\u00a7 20-44).\n10. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n11. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n12. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n13.

There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Government submitted a preliminary objection that the applicant had failed to exhaust the required domestic remedies. They stressed that the applicant had failed to appeal against the decisions of 5 October 1995, 27 November 1997 and 7 January 2005.\n39.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 April 2004 and 11 July 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. National Insurance\n11. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory national insurance (\u201cNI\u201d) contributions into the National Insurance Fund (NIF). This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n12. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NI scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NI contributions fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paras. 25-26).\n13. Primary Class 1 contributions to NI cease to be payable on attainment of the State retirement age (section 6(3) of the SSCBA).\n14. The NIF is currently the sole source of funding for payment of state retirement pensions as well as a number of other benefits, including IB. Topping up into the fund by way of Treasury Grant is possible in times of shortfall but has not occurred since 1997/1998.\n##### 2. Invalidity Benefit (IB)\n15. The Social Security (Incapacity for work) Act 1994 amended the 1992 Act so as to include provision for the payment of IB from April 1995. Section 1 provides, as relevant:\n\u201c... (1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, a person who satisfies either of the following conditions is entitled to short-term incapacity benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of incapacity for work.\n(2) The conditions are that -\n(a) he is under pensionable age on the day in question and satisfies the contribution conditions specified for short-term incapacity benefit in Schedule 3, Part 1, paragraph 2;\n...\n(4) In any period of incapacity for work a person is not entitled to short-term incapacity benefit for more than 364 days.\n(5) Where a person ceases by virtue of subsection (4) above to be entitled to short-term incapacity benefit, he is entitled to long-term incapacity benefit in respect of any subsequent day of incapacity for work in the same period of incapacity for work on which he is not over pensionable age.\u201d\n16. IB is a contributory benefit funded out of NI contributions, designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or disability. It is therefore available throughout the assumed working life. As a result the period of entitlement is directly linked, for men and women, to the period of entitlement (if any) to receive the State retirement pension. When an individual reaches State pension age any entitlement to such a pension takes the place of IB. A full basic retirement pension pays GBP 77.45 per week, while the standard rate of IB is GBP 72.15.\n##### 3. State retirement pension\n17. At the relevant time, section 122 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 defined \u201cpensionable age\u201d as:\n\u201c(a) the age of 65, in the case of a man; and\n(b) the age of 60, in the case of a woman\u201d.\n18. Women in the United Kingdom therefore become eligible for a State pension at the age of 60, whereas men are not eligible until 65.\n19. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The State pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in the State pension age.\n#### C. European Union law\n20. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d.\n21. In its judgment in Case C-328/91 Thomas and Others [1993] ECR I-1247, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that where, pursuant to Article 7(1)(a), a Member State prescribed different pensionable ages for men and women for the purpose of granting old-age and retirement pensions the scope of the permitted derogation defined by the words \u201cpossible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under other benefits schemes which were necessarily and objectively linked to the difference in pensionable age. That was the position where such forms of discrimination were objectively necessary to avoid disturbing the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure coherence between the retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes.\n22. In Case C-92/94 Secretary of State for Social Security v. Graham [1999] ECR I-2521, the ECJ considered the predecessor of IB, namely invalidity allowance and invalidity pension (both contributory benefits paid from NI contributions until pen", "001-67071": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF PEDERSEN AND PEDERSEN v.

The applicants complained that the proceedings in their cases had exceeded a reasonable time, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ...any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal...\u201d\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n35. The Government maintained that based on an overall assessment and in the light of the specific circumstances of the cases, the criminal charges against the applicants were determined within a reasonable time as prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention. They agreed that the cases were uncomplicated as concerned the facts, but found that they were to some extent complex due to problems in law as well as procure. In this respect the Government referred inter alia to the involvement of EU-law issues, notably the question whether the relevant provision of the 1989 Act should have been notified to the European Commission and the question whether the cases should have been referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Moreover, the Government found that the applicants to a very considerable extent had been a contributory cause to the length of the proceedings. Finally, the Government maintained that it could not give rise to criticism that the city courts decided to adjourn the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the \u201ctest-cases\u201d as these decisions were reasonably motivated. All in all the Government found it inappropriate that the applicants on the one hand requested adjournments of the proceedings; extensions of time-limits for submission of pleadings; were unable to appear before court hearings before certain dates; raised questions of principles, including a request for a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice; requested an expert witness; and a special counsel assigned, and on the other hand claimed that the length of the proceedings were excessive.\n36. The applicants contested that the proceedings were complex. On the contrary, it was very simple cases and the only unusual initiative was the request to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The latter, however, had been of crucial relevance and the applicants could not be blamed for making use of remedies available under Danish law. Furthermore, the applicants found that there were several periods of unacceptable inactivity during the proceedings for which only the Government were to blame, including the delay caused by the applicants\u2019 claim that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority. In any event the applicants found that the duration of the proceedings before the Supreme Court had been excessive. Two other factors had caused an unreasonable delay of the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 opinion; the adjournment of their cases pending the outcome of corresponding cases and the lack of resources in the Danish court system. Finally, the applicants pointed out that they had not in any way been compensated for the lengthy proceedings e.g. by having been imposed a mo", "001-78427": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BURDEN and BURDEN v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 September and 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance tax\n12. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person's property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 275,000 for transfers between 5 April 2005 and 5 April 2006; GBP 285,000 for transfers during the tax year 2006-2007; and GBP 300,000 for 2007-2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n13. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the tax-payer's election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (1984 Act, section 227(1)-(4)).\n14. Section 18(1) of the 1984 Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005, this exemption was extended to a deceased's \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d)\n15. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n16. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n17. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The 2004 Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering inter alia pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n18. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was passed in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had co-habited for at least 12 years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n19. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour Peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Caithlin [the Conservative Peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times\u2014at Second Reading and in Grand Committee\u2014and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, Liberal Democrat Peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith MP, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill\u2014granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law, with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings.\nWe heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that the Civil Partnership Bill is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives, not because those concerns are not important, but because the Bill is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them.\u201d\n#### C. The Human Rights Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1998 Act\u201d)\n20. The 1998 Act entered into force on 2 October 2000. Section 3(1) provides:\n\u201cSo far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\u201d\nSection 4 of the 1998 Act provides (so far as relevant):\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. ...\n(6) A declaration under this section ... -\n(a) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given; and\n(b) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.\u201d\nSection 6 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if -\n(a) as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted any differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of ... primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions. ...\u201d\nSection 10 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) This section applies if \u2013\n(a) a provision of legislation has been declared under section 4 to be incompatible with a Convention right and, if an appeal lies \u2013\n(i) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so; or\n(ii) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time; or\n(iii) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned; or\n(b) it appears to a Minister of the Crown or Her Majesty in Council that, having regard to a finding of the European Court of Human Rights made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against the United Kingdom, a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of the United Kingdom arising from the Convention.\n(2) If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility.\u201d\n21. The Government submitted that the objective of giving the national courts the power under section 4 had been to provide a formal means for notifying the Government and Parliament about a situation in which legislation was found not to comply with the Convention, and to provide a mechanism for speedily correcting the defect. Once a declaration had been made (or once the European Court of Human Rights had found a violation based on a provision of domestic law), there were two alternative avenues for putting right the problem: either primary legislation could be introduced in Parliament, or the Minister concerned could exercise his summary power of amendment under section 10 of the 1998 Act.\n22. When the Human Rights Bill passed through the House of Lords on 27 November 1997, the Lord Chancellor explained that:\n\u201cwe expect that the government and Parliament will in all cases almost certainly be prompted to change the law following a declaration of incompatibility.\u201d\nOne of the Ministers with responsibility for the 1998 Act explained to the House of Commons on 21 October 1998 that:\n\u201cOur proposals [for remedial orders] safeguard parliamentary procedures and sovereignty, ensure proper supervision of our laws and ensure that we can begin to get the ability both to enforce human rights law and to create a human rights culture. They also ensure that we can do it in the context of not having to worry that if something is decided by the Strasbourg court or by our courts that creates an incompatibility, we do not have a mechanism to deal with it in the quick and efficient way that may be necessary.\u201d\nThe most recent report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, published on 4 August 2006, showed that declarations of incompatibility had been made in twenty cases between December 2000 and December 2004. In seven of these cases the declaration had been overturned on appeal, or the judgment on appeal was pending. In ten cases the offending legislation had been amended or repealed (in one case by a remedial order), and in the remaining three cases, amendments to the offending legislation were pending or under consideration.\nTHE LAW\n23. The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, that when one of them died, the survivor would face a significant liability to inheritance tax, which would not be faced by the survivor of a marriage or a civil partnership. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION\n24. The Government contested the admissibility of the application on a number of grounds under Articles 34 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Article 34 provides:\n\u201cThe Court may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. ... \u201d\nArticle 35 \u00a7 1 states:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.\u201d\n#### A. The applicants' victim status\n25. The Government submitted that the complaint was prospective and hypothetical, because no liability to inheritance tax had yet accrued, and might never accrue. The present applicants could not, therefore, claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d of any violation, and their complaint represented a challenge to the tax regime in abstracto, which the Court could not entertain.\nThe present case was on that ground distinguishable from Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, where the applicants had been complaining about certain provisions of Belgian law that applied automatically to the illegitimate child and her mother, and Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, where the complaint concerned rights of inheritance where the parent had already died. In contrast, the requirement to pay inheritance tax did not apply automatically. The applicants were not so affected by the risk of a future liability to tax as to bring them into a comparable position to the applicants in Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1982, Series A no. 48, where the Court found that a th", "001-85728": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SZULC v.

Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002), and \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC] (no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 52\u201154, ECHR 2005-IV).\n32. By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Journal on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n33. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s representative was not duly authorised to introduce the application on behalf of the applicant before the Court and the application should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione personae. In particular, they indicated that the authority form of 15 July 2004 did not contain the representative\u2019s signature.\n34. The applicant contested that argument. He noted that he had signed an authority form for Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent his interests before the Court. He further maintained that Mr A. Cang\u0131 had been representing him since the early stages of the proceedings and that he had not received any instructions from the Court concerning the validity of the submitted authority form.\n35. The Court observes that on 4 August 2004 the applicant\u2019s representative signed and submitted a complete application form on behalf of the applicant along with a power of attorney filled in and signed by the applicant himself.\n36. In these circumstances the Court considers that, by providing the Court with the power of attorney authorising Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent him before the Court, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that he wished Mr A. Cang\u0131 to make an application to the Court on his behalf. It therefore finds that the present application cannot be rejected as incompatible ratione personae pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention, and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. The applicant complained that he had not received a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the presence of a military judge sitting on the bench of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. He further alleged under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that the \u0130zmir State Security Court had sentenced him on the basis of statements obtained in his absence, which he could not challenge during the proceedings against him and that, despite his requests, the court had not heard any witnesses in his favour.\nArticle 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, insofar as relevant, provide:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merit", "001-76453": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KEEGAN v.

Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides for entry and search without a search warrant:\n\u201c(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section ..., a constable may enter and search any premises for the purpose\u2013\n...\n(b) of arresting a person for an arrestable offence;\n...\u201d\n22. Police can also apply to the magistrates\u2019 court for a warrant. The grant of a warrant is subject to the safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 15 provides, inter alia, that the constable must state the ground on which he makes the application and the enactment under which the warrant would be issued; specify the premises to be entered and searched; and identify in so far as practicable the articles or persons sought. Applications are made ex parte and supported by an information in writing. The constable must answer on oath any question put to him by the Justice of the Peace or judge. There is no statutory requirement for the court issuing the warrant to make findings or give reasons for issuing the warrant.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicants complained of the forcible entry by the police to search their home, relying on Article 8 of the Convention which provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his home ....\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder or crime ...\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n24. The applicants asserted that the circumstances in which the police had entered their house and the fact that domestic law permitted that constituted a breach of Article 8. The applicants had contested in the domestic proceedings that the police had been relying on their power under section 17 of the 1984 Act, in respect of which there was no prior judicial control, and, in any event, whether that was the case or not, there was no possibility of bringing a claim for trespass against police officers who entered while in possession of a valid warrant or any possibility of obtaining damages without showing malice on the part of the police. They emphasised that the domestic courts had found that there had been no reasonable and probable cause for obtaining the warrant and it followed that the information supplied to the officers effecting the entry must also have been defective.\n25. The applicants made reference to the lack of judicial supervision of the procedure, drawing attention to the significant gap of time between the alleged offences and the date on which the warrant was obtained and then executed, and submitted that it was clear that there was considerable information which showed that the suspected robber did not live at their address and that they did. Furthermore, they argued that the link between the cash proceeds of the robbery and premises possibly linked to Dean Metcalfe was slight, and that neither was there any urgency preventing recourse to other methods of investigation.\n26. The applicants submitted that the condition of malice was too restrictive a condition in relation to rights as important as the security of the home. It was not the case that every unsuccessful search disclosed a breach of Article 8, but they urged that the proper balancing safeguard should be the consideration of whether there was reasonable and probable cause for the warrant. It was irrelevant that the police executing the warrant acted in good faith as the warrant was sought without adequate investigation.\n##### 2. The Government\n27. The Government submitted that the principles to be found in domestic law struck the right balance between the public interest in the investigation of crime and the rights of those individuals who sought to pursue a private remedy against the police. They argued that the arrest and gathering of evidence against suspects was often difficult, even dangerous, and the courts had to be careful not to impede investigators in the course of their legitimate duties. The absence of a requirement of malice would impose liability for negligence and potentially expose chief constables to the possibility of civil action on almost every occasion when warrants were obtained. The fact that a search proved to be unsuccessful did not in itself give rise to a cause of action. Primary protection was given to a person\u2019s rights in regard to invasion of property by the requirement that a search be on a warrant granted by a judicial officer who must be satisfied that there was reasonable cause. They relied on judicial dicta that this judicial supervision was not merely a rubber stamp, because it was not sufficient for the judge to be satisfied by the officer\u2019s oath that he believed the grounds for the warrant; the cause for the belief also had to appear reasonable to the judge. Further, the grant of warrants was subject to procedural conditions set out in domestic law, warrants could be quashed in proceedings for judicial review, and where the police acted maliciously, they would be liable in damages.\n28.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The Secretary of State is responsible for the management of the prison system in England and Wales (Prison Act 1952, sections 1 and 4).\n23. Until November 2007 each prison was required to appoint a medical officer (Prison Act 1952, section 7(1)). The medical officer was a prison officer who had to be a registered medical practitioner (Prison Act 1952, section 4). This requirement was removed by section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007 which came into force on 1 November 2007. Prison health care is now generally integrated with, and commissioned by, the National Health Service (NHS).\n24. Section 47(1) of the Prison Act 1952 authorises the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of prisons and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein. Such rules are made by statutory instrument, laid before Parliament, and are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (Prison Act 1952, section 52(1) and the Criminal Justice Act 1967, section 66(4)).\n25. Prisoners are classified in accordance with directions of the Secretary of State (Prison Rules SI 1999/728 rule 7(1)). Prisoners are classified in accordance with PSO 0900. Paragraph 1.1.1 of PSO 0900 contains the definitions of the four categories of prisoner (A, B, C and D). Category A is applied to prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or the security of the State, no matter how unlikely that escape might be, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible.

Rule 34 of the Prison Rules is headed \u201cCommunications Generally\u201d It provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) Without prejudice to sections 6 and 19 of the Prison Act 1952 and except as provided by these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any person outside the prison, or such person with him, except with the leave of the Secretary of State or as a privilege under rule 8.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, and except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the Secretary of State may impose any restriction or condition, either generally or in a particular case, upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons if he considers that the restriction or condition to be imposed \u2013\n(a) does not interfere with the Convention rights of any person; or\n(b) (i) is necessary on grounds specified in paragraph (3) below;\n(ii) reliance on the grounds is compatible with the Convention right to be interfered with; and\n(iii) the restriction or condition is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved.\n(3) The grounds referred to in paragraph (2) above are \u2013\n(a) the interests of national security;\n(b) the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime;\n(c) the interests of public safety;\n(d) securing or maintaining prison security or good order and discipline in prison;\n(e) the protection of health or morals;\n(f) the protection of the reputation of others;\n(g) maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary; or\n(h) the protection of the rights and freedoms of any person.\n...\n(8) In this rule \u2013\n...\n(c) references to Convention rights are to the Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998.\u201d\n27. Rule 39 of the Prison Rules deals with correspondence with legal advisers and courts and provides that such correspondence may only be opened, read or stopped by the prison governor in accordance with the provision of that rule, namely when the governor has cause to believe either that the correspondence contains an illicit enclosure or that its contents endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature.\n28. Chapter 36.1 of PSO 1000, which was applicable at the relevant time and which dealt with prisoner communications in connection with those who were in Category A prisons, or who were in prisons which held Category A prisoners, provided as follows:\n\u201cPrison management must provide facilities for prisoners to maintain contact with family and friends. Prisoners\u2019 rights to respect for their private and family life and correspondence are also protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Prison Service\u2019s duty to protect the public allows us to interfere in this privacy in order to minimise the possibility that, in communicating with the outside world, prisoners:\n(i) plan escapes or disturbances;\n(ii) jeopardise the security and good order of the prison;\n(iii) engage in offences against criminal law or prison discipline;\n(iv) jeopardise national security;\n(v) infringe the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n29. Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000 read:\n\u201cAll correspondence, other than correspondence protected by PR39 [that is correspondence with legal advisors] or that with the Samaritans, must be read as a matter of routine in the following cases:\n(i) all prisoners of whatever security category, held in a unit which itself holds Category A prisoners.\u201d\n30. Chapter 36.22 continued as follows:\n\u201cRoutine reading is necessary in these cases in order to prevent escape and, in the case of Category A prisoners, in the interests of public safety. It is also necessary in preventing crime and disorder, for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and, in some cases, necessary in the interests of national security or the economic well being of the country.\u201d\n31.

The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the above-cited Findlay case (at pp. 272-276, \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n11. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n12. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n13. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n14. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Widow's Pensions 1925-2001\n15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30:\n\u201c[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance: 'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.\nThe secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons' and widows' pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at a reduced rate), whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of WMA.\nIn 1985 the government published a Green Paper on Social Security Reform which pointed out (in paragraph 10.9) that the current system of benefits dated from days when far fewer married women worked:\n'Today two thirds of all married women with children over school age, and over a half of widows between 40 and 60, go to work. The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows' other income, in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children. The Government's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support, and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work.'\nDespite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions, the Social Security Act 1986 made relatively modest adjustments to the system. The 26 week transitional widow's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [Widow's Payment: 'WPt'] of \u00a31,000 substituted. The age at which WP became payable, whether on bereavement or cessation of WMA, was raised to 45 and entitlement to the full rate postponed until 55. These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the 1992 Act.\nThe 1986 changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows. But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that WP should be extended to men. It is true that Cruse, a non-governmental organisation for 'the widowed and their children', which had taken widowers on board in 1980, said in their 1986-87 annual report:\n'We ... continued to press for a widower's pension, based on his wife's national insurance contributions, and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers.'\nBut this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of WP for widowers in Parliament. The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from the European Commission. There had been a Council Directive 79/7/EEC in 1978 on 'the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security' which expressly excluded survivors' benefits. In 1987 the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive (Com (87) 494 Final). It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of the Court of Justice in Razzouk and Beydoun v Commission of the European Communities (Cases 75/82 and 117/82), [1984] ECR 1509, 1530, para 16 (a case concerning survivors' pensions under the Community's own Staff Regulations) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women 'forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure.' Article 4 of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits:\n'and to this end:\n(a) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows;\n(b) or the replacement of widows' benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex.'\nThe House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities (Sub-Committee C) held an inquiry into the proposal in 1989. Miss Joan C. Brown, a writer on social security matters, said in evidence to the Committee that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows. The only way to produce equality was to level down. But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen many years earlier to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children:\n'the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through. This suggests the need to phase out the older widow's pension over a long period\u2014in the order of 10-15 years. Without this, there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of their day and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result.'\nThe Select Committee accepted Miss Brown's evidence and reported (Session 1988-89, 10th Report, HL Paper 51):\n'In the United Kingdom...there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme, irrespective of her earnings, if she is aged 45 or more when her husband dies. This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re-establishing herself in the labour market\u2014whereas a widower's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way.\nThe Committee consider that, despite these difficulties, the concept of equal treatment must require that, eventually, men and women should be provided with survivors' benefits on the same terms. Employment patterns are changing and, if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives, it will make sense for equal survivors' benefits to be available. There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother, rather than the father, becomes the principal breadwinner. It would, however, be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality. To reduce this danger, a substantial period should be allowed\u2014at least 15 years\u2014before Member States are obliged to equalise survivors' benefits. Community law recognises a principle of 'legitimate expectation' which would support this approach.", "001-83335": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF STEFF v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The United Kingdom\n##### 1. General provisions on voting in parliamentary elections\n7. Section 1(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if on the date of the poll he is, inter alia, registered in the register of parliamentary electors for a constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Pursuant to section 4(1), a person is entitled to be registered if on the relevant date he is, inter alia, resident in the constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.\n##### 2. Provisions regarding persons with a service qualification\n8. Sections 14-17 of the 1983 Act allow certain categories of persons otherwise eligible to vote who do not fulfill the normal residence requirements to continue to register to vote by making a \u201cservice declaration\u201d. A service declaration can be made by a person who is (a) a member of the forces, (b) employed in the service of the Crown in a post outside the United Kingdom of any prescribed class or description, (c) employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom, or (d) the spouse or civil partner of a person falling within categories (a), (b) or (c) above.\n9. Section 17 provides that where a person\u2019s service declaration is in force, he shall be regarded for the purposes of section 4 of the 1983 Act as a resident on the date of the declaration at the address specified in it (current or former address in the United Kingdom).\n##### 3. Provisions regarding overseas voters\n(a) Current legislation\n10. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 as amended (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d) provides that a person who is a British citizen is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if he qualifies as an overseas elector on the date on which he makes an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d (see paragraph 14 below). A person qualifies as an overseas elector if he is not resident in the United Kingdom and he satisfies one of the sets of conditions set out in the legislation.\n11. The relevant set of conditions for the purpose of the present case is set out in section 1(3):\n\u201cThe first set of conditions is that\u2014\n(a) he was included in a register of parliamentary electors in respect of an address at a place that is situated within the constituency concerned,\n(b) that entry in the register was made on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at that address,\n(c) that entry in the register was in force at any time falling within the period of 15 years ending immediately before the relevant date [i.e. the date on which the applicant makes a declaration under section 2], and\n(d) subsequent to that entry ceasing to have effect no entry was made in any register of parliamentary electors on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at any other address.\u201d\n12. Section 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to be registered pursuant to an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d in the constituency where he was last registered to vote or last resided and the registration officer concerned is satisfied that he qualifies as an overseas elector in respect of that constituency. Where the entitlement of a person to remain registered as an overseas voter terminates, the registration officer concerned shall remove that person\u2019s entry from the register (section 2(2)).\n13. Section 2(3) requires that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration state the date of the declaration, that the declarant is a British citizen, that the declarant is not resident in the United Kingdom, and the date on which he ceased to be so resident.\n14. Section 2(4) stipulates that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration must show which set of conditions in section 1 of the Act the declarant claims to satisfy and, in the case of the first set of conditions, specify the address in respect of which he was registered.\n(b) History to the current legislation\n15. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 Act, no British citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary, i.e. general, election in the United Kingdom, other than members of the armed forces or Crown servants.\n16. In 1982 a parliamentary committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee, published a report on the Representation of the People Acts which recommended that British citizens living in what were then Member States of the European Economic Community should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period. The Government\u2019s response to that report recommended a seven-year limit for all overseas voters, expressing the view that a person\u2019s links with the United Kingdom were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for as long as ten years.\n17. The 1985 Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to British citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous five years. The bill originally proposed a seven-year period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short. Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time-limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with the United Kingdom were also raised.\n18. The five-year period was extended to twenty years by virtue of section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1989. The bill which led to the Act was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time-limit to twenty-five years. During parliamentary debates, the Secretary of State acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut-off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who, although resident abroad for some time, had retained close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and those who had \u201ccut adrift\u201d from such links much earlier. Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views, with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum.\n19. Section 1 of the 1989 Act was subsequently repealed and replaced, with retention of the twenty-year period, by section 8 and Schedule 2 of the Representation of the People Act 2000.\n20. In September 1998 the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on Electoral Law and Administration. It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced. The relevant extract of its report reads:\n\u201c113. The Representation of the People Act 1985 introduced a right for British citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and European elections for up to five years following their move overseas. This period was increased to twenty years under the Representation of the People Act 1989. The peak year for actual registrations under the Act was in 1991 when 34,500 registered; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in 1997, when the total stood at 23,600, followed by a further fall in 1998 to 17,300. Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged as high as three million.\n114. It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote. Professor Blackburn argued that the system meant that \u2018an expatriate living hundreds or thousands of miles away, for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation, carrying memories of British politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live, can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019. Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrat representatives both suggested that 20 years was perhaps too long. Professor Blackburn suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the UK or to an intention to return.\n115. On the other hand, it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue. It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the UK and are those most likely to be planning to return. A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home. The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be lowered but from people who had been resident overseas for more than twenty years arguing for it to be increased.\n116. On balance, we take the view that the twenty year maximum period within which a British citizen overseas may retain the right to vote is excessive and that the earlier limit \u2013 five years \u2013 should be restored.\u201d (emphasis in original; references omitted)\n21. The twenty-year period was subsequently reduced to fifteen years pursuant to section 141(a) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The bill preceding the Act proposed a reduction to ten years. During parliamentary debates, the relevant Government minster explained that the proposed ten-year period struck a balance between the various strongly-held views expressed. During the bill\u2019s passage through the House of Lords, the Government minister proposed an increase to fifteen years in response to concerns aired during the debate. While the minister accepted that the amendment represented a broad-brush approach, he considered it to be the most equitable approach that could be adopted.\n(c) Recent legislative and policy developments\n22. On 6 May 2009, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, an amendment was proposed to raise the period for overseas voting from fifteen to twenty years. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe first is that we live in an era of increasing globalisation and internationalisation of economic activity, a process which has gathered pace since the reduction of the qualifying period in 2000. Secondly, we need to reflect the different nature of modern society and the mobility of populations. Thirdly, I seek to reflect the fact of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union.\u201d\n23. The Government minister defended the fifteen-year period, noting the absence of any compelling argument or evidence that would justify a change. He considered that the focus should be instead on raising the registration rate of overseas voters, noting that fewer than 13,000 overseas voters were registered in England and Wales as of 1 December 2008. The amendment was not passed.\n24. During a short debate in the House of Lords on 2 March 2011 regarding voting arrangements for overseas electors, some members called on the Government to reconsider the fifteen-year period. Attention was drawn to the fact that those who worked abroad for international organisations did not have the same voting rights as members of the armed forces, Crown servants and employees of the British Council, who were not subject to the fifteen-year limit. The Government minister acknowledged that the Government ought to address the issue of overseas votes, noting that of an estimated 5.5 million British citizens resident abroad, only about 30,000 actually voted.\n25. On 27 June 2012, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, an amendment was proposed in the House of Commons to remove the fifteen-year rule. The reasons for the proposed amendment were explained as follows:\n\u201cAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 5.6 million British citizens currently live abroad. The shocking truth is that although, as of last December, about 4.4 million of them were of voting age, only 23,388 were registered for an overseas vote, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 electoral statistics. Out of 4.4 million potential overseas voters, only 23,000-odd are actually registered! ...\n...\nIn most other countries, both developed and emerging, voting rights for parliamentary elections depend solely on nationality, not on an arbitrary time limit. For example, US nationals can vote in presidential, congressional and state elections, regardless of where they reside in the world. Similarly, Australian nationals can vote in the equivalent elections there, no matter where they live. However, the most startling example comes from our nearest neighbour. French citizens in the UK have just elected a new President and taken part in parliamentary elections for one of the 11 Members of Parliament whose job it is solely to represent French people abroad ....\nThe right of Spaniards abroad to vote is enshrined in article 68 of the Spanish constitution. ...\n...\n[A]ll Portuguese citizens living abroad have the same right to vote in Assembly elections as fellow citizens living in their home country. The simple fact is that the citizens of the US, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and all these other countries have better voting rights for their citizens abroad than we do for British citizens living abroad.\nFor a democracy as ancient as ours, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a stain on our democratic principles that our citizens are placed at such a disadvantage when they have moved abroad compared with citizens from those other countries. Her Majesty\u2019s Government is very happy to collect tax from most of the enormous number of people involved, but denies them the vote.\u201d\n...\n\u201cThe states in which these British citizens reside do not allow them to vote as residents, because voting rights are based on nationality and not residence, and they cannot vote in the UK on the basis of the current rule, for which there is no obvious rationale. I challenge the Deputy Leader of the House to state where there would be any disadvantage in abolishing the rule. The consequence of the rule is that many British citizens living abroad are in a state of electoral limbo, unable to participate in any election whatsoever. That seems to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.\u201d\n26. The Government minister replied that the Government would give the issue \u201cserious consideration\u201d. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn.\n27. A similar amendment to the bill was proposed at the Committee stage in the House of Lords on 14 January 2013. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe fundamental issue at stake here is the complete exclusion of so many British citizens living abroad for more than 15 years from the right to vote here. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 55% of those who moved abroad in 2008 did so for work-related reasons, 25% for study and 20% for life in retirement. With an ageing population, and increased opportunities for work and study abroad, people are likely to continue to leave the United Kingdom in substantial numbers. Many of them will reside abroad for more than 15 years. In the countries to which they move, voting rights rest overwhelmingly on nationality, not residence. Apart from some nine Commonwealth countries \u2013 mainly islands in the West Indies \u2013 I understand that no state permits British citizens to vote in its principal national elections. They therefore exist in an electoral limbo.\n...\nWithin the European Union, Britain compares unfavourably with most of its partners. Of the 27 EU members, 22 countries allow their expatriate citizens the right to vote, without any restriction on the period of residence outside the home country. That is apart from Germany, which restricts it to 25 years for expatriates living outside the EU. Just two countries, Denmark and the United Kingdom, restrict the period for voting rights: the UK to 15 years and Denmark to four. In three countries \u2013 Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland and Malta \u2013 expatriates have no right to vote.\nThe world has become much smaller. Britons overseas can listen to our radio via their computer, they can watch British television and read British newspapers just as rapidly as anyone living here, if they subscribe to them electronically. I make a confident prediction that this debate in our House today will attract one of the largest television online audiences abroad that your Lordships have had. I have met many British overseas residents who are as well, if not better, informed about British political affairs than the average voter here. So the old argument about expatriates\u2019 inability to make an informed judgment about the great issues in our political life no longer holds.\u201d\n28. The Government minister responded that the question whether the time limit was appropriate was a wider question which remained under consideration within Government. He noted that there were valid arguments on both sides which needed to be carefully considered alongside any practical issues before any informed decisions could be taken. The amendment was withdrawn but it was subsequently reintroduced on 23 January 2013 during the Report stage of the bill, with further debate taking place. Again, the Government minister indicated that the issue was under consideration by Government and the amendment was withdrawn.\n(d) Judicial review proceedings in Preston ([2011] EWHC 3174 (Admin) and [2012] EWCA Civ 1378)\n29. On 1 December 2011, the High Court handed down judgment in the case of Preston v Wandsworth Borough Council and Lord President of the Council. The claimant was a long-term resident of Spain who sought judicial review of the fifteen-year rule under section 1(3) of the 1985 Act. He argued that he had a directly effective right under European Union law to move to and reside in other Member States and that the fifteen-year rule operated unjustifiably to interfere with the exercise of that right.\n30. The court found that there was no evidential basis for the contention that the fifteen-year rule created a barrier of any kind to free movement. The matter therefore did not fall within the scope of EU law. That being so, the issue of justification did not arise. The court nonetheless indicated that it considered the rule to be a proportionate interference with the right to free movement. It was of the view that the Government were entitled to hold that there was a legitimate objective which the rule was designed to achieve, namely to remove the right to vote from those whose links with the United Kingdom had diminished and who were not, for the most part at least, directly affected by the laws passed there. It observed:\n\u201c44. ... [T]he 15 year rule is designed to establish a test to identify when the absence of residence can fairly be said to have diluted the link with the UK sufficient to justify the removal of the right to vote. The fact that some residence tests do not properly or proportionately measure the strength of commitment does not mean that the adoption of a non-residence test cannot legitimately measure the weakening of commitment. This rule does not fix on non-residence at some particular point in time; it requires a consistent period of non-residence. In my judgment that is a justified way to measure the dilution of commitment. Thereafter the choice of a bright line rule is inevitable. It would in my view be wholly impracticable to adopt a rule which required consideration of the personal circumstances of all potential expatriate voters ...\u201d\n31. The court found that decisions of this Court upholding residence rules were \u201chighly material\u201d (referring to Hilbe v. Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2004\u2011X; and Doyle v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30158/06, 6 February 2007).\n32. Finally, the court considered that the exceptions to the fifteen-year period for certain categories of citizens were justified as the individuals concerned were resident in other States at the request of the United Kingdom in order to look after its national interests.\n33. In its judgment of 25 October 2012, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the High Court on both the question of the existence of an interference with free movement rights and the question of justification. Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment for the court and, on the latter issue, noted in particular:\n\u201c89. First, the Divisional Court was entitled to hold ... that the 15 year rule had a legitimate aim, i.e. to test the strength of a British citizen\u2019s links with the UK over a significant period of time by measuring past commitment to the UK and seeing whether it was sufficiently diminished or diluted to justify removal of the right to vote in parliamentary elections. That aim was legitimate for the purpose of confining the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with an ascertainable, continuing, close and objective connection with the UK, whose government made decisions and whose Parliament passed laws that most directly affected those British citizens resident in the UK.\n90. Secondly, the residence of a citizen is not ... an arbitrary measure of connection with a country: far from it, residence is a relevant, rational and practicable criterion for assessing the closeness of the links between a British citizen and the UK.\n91. Thirdly, the 15 year rule is proportionate to the aim. The length of the period represents three Parliamentary terms. It provides a substantial opportunity for continued voting by British citizens who have moved to reside in another EU country.\n92. Fourthly, it is impracticable for the franchise criteria to be other than bright line rules capable of reasonably consistent practical application. It would be unworkable and disproportionate for the electoral authorities to have to make individual merits assessments of the particular circumstances of each resident in another EU country on a case-by-case basis in order to determine how close a connection there is between that particular individual and the UK despite prolonged absence.\n93. Fifthly, there is no objectionable inconsistency of treatment arising from the excepted categories of overseas residents, such as members of the armed services and Crown employees. In general, they do not move to reside overseas as a voluntary exercise of the right to free movement ... [T]heir circumstances are distinguishable from those of the claimant and others who, like him, have chosen, for their own personal reasons, to live in another Member State.\u201d\n#### B. Italy\n34. A foreign national may acquire Italian citizenship after having been resident in Italy and enrolled in the register of the population of a municipality for four years in the case of nationals of European Union Member States. Citizenship may also be acquired after two years of marriage to an Italian citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted.\n35. A foreign national wishing to acquire Italian citizenship must pay a fee of 200 euros plus a notarial fee of around 15 euros. Application forms are available on the website of the Ministry of Interior. An oath of allegiance to the Italian Republic must be sworn.\n36. All Italian citizens are entitled to vote in Italian parliamentary elections (unless excluded for such things as conviction for certain offences etc.).\n### III.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Land Code\n15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code.\n16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations.\n17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service.\n18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence.\n19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides:\n\u201cWhen using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...\u201d\nDisturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42.\nSpecial provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement. A tenant's refusal to abide by such provisions and regulations may also constitute a failure to fulfil the requirements for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition.\n20. It follows from section 46 that if the landlord has given notice of cancellation of the tenancy agreement, the tenant may still be entitled to have the agreement extended. However, subsection 1 of section 46 lists a number of situations in which the tenant loses the right to renewal. The first situation, laid down in subsection 1(1), is the forfeiture of the tenancy. Section 42 stipulates the conditions in which a tenancy agreement is deemed to be forfeited, including residential disturbances and failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. The second situation, regulated in subsection 1(2), was relied on by the landlord and applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. It concerns the tenant's neglect of their obligations. If the obligations are neglected to such an extent that it is not reasonable for the tenancy agreement to be extended, the tenant may lose the right to such renewal.\nThe preparatory works to the latter provision state that the requirements of orderliness must be high in order to make it possible for the landlord to maintain the property in good order and condition (SOU 1961:47, pp. 84-85). The interests of the landlord shall be weighed against the reasonableness of the tenancy being terminated. Distressing personal circumstances may be taken into account. The possibility of another flat in the same area should also be considered (Government Bill 1968:91, Appendix A, p. 91).\nExamples of negligence are, for example, failure to pay rent, subletting without permission, refusing to grant the landlord access to the flat, depositing rent without valid reasons, residential disturbances, a failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition, and a breach of clauses in the tenancy agreement.\n#### B. Proceedings in tenancy disputes\n21. A large number of tenancy disputes are examined by the eight regional rent review boards, whose task it is, under section 4 of the Lease Review Boards and Rent Review Boards Act (Lagen om arrenden\u00e4mnder och hyresn\u00e4mnder, 1973:1988), to examine disputes concerning, for example, the terms of a tenancy and disputes relating to the renewal of a tenancy agreement. A decision by a Rent Review Board in a renewal dispute, as in the present case, can be appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal, in accordance with the Land Code, Chapter 12, section 70 in conjunction with section 49. No appeal lies against the court's decision, as provided for in section 10 of the Svea Court of Appeal Rent Cases Judicial Procedure Act (Lagen om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i vissa hyresm\u00e5l i Svea hovr\u00e4tt, 1994:831).\n#### C. Constitutional provisions on freedom of expression and freedom of information\n22. Chapter 1, section 3, subsection 3 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) states the following:\n\u201cSubject to any contrary provision of this Constitutional Law neither public authorities nor other public bodies shall prohibit or prevent the possession or employment of such technical aids as are necessary to receive radio programmes or to view or hear the content of technical recordings on grounds of the content of a radio programme or technical recording,.The same shall apply to any ban on the construction of landline networks for the transmission of radio programmes.\u201d\n23. Chapter 2, section 1, subsection 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201cEvery citizen shall be guaranteed the following rights and freedoms in his relations with the public institutions:\n1. freedom of expression: that is, the freedom to communicate information and express thoughts, opinions and sentiments, whether orally, pictorially, in writing, or in any other way;\n2. freedom of information: that is, the freedom to procure and receive information and otherwise acquaint oneself with the utterances of others;\n...\u201d\nSection 12 provides that the enumerated rights and freedoms may be restricted only to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society. The restriction may never go beyond what is necessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free formation of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy. Furthermore, no restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious, cultural or other such opinion. Under section 13, freedom of expression and information can only be restricted on grounds of national security, national provisio", "001-90200": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF MOESGAARD PETERSEN v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n27. The Government contested that argument and maintained that the proceedings began on 2 July 1996, when the police had carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises.\n28. The applicant was of the view that the proceedings had begun on 6 May 1994, but agreed with the Government that he had certainly been substantially affected as from 2 July 1996. The applicant also pointed out that the High Court had mistakenly found that the proceedings had begun only on 12 February 1998, which was part of the applicant\u2019s argument for bringing the case before the Supreme Court.\n29. The Court considers that the applicant was not substantially affected by the proceedings until 2 July 1996, when the police carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises. The proceedings ended on 21 June 2006, when the Leave to Appeal Board refused the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court\u2019s judgment. Thus, the criminal proceedings lasted almost ten years.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of the proceedings\n30. From a general point of view the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed with reference to the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the authorities before which the case was brought (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n##### 1. Complexity of the case\n31. The Government submitted that the criminal proceedings were extraordinarily complex as concerns the facts, law and procedural issues.\n32. The applicant disputed that the case was highly complex and emphasised, among other things, that in his case very few foreign company structures were used and almost all the banks were based in Denmark, thus a very limited part of the investigation had to be carried out abroad.\n33. The Court reiterates that the scale and complexity of a criminal case concerning fraud, which is often compounded further by the involvement of several suspects, may justify the extensive length of proceedings (see, among other authorities, ", "001-57874": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF STANFORD v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. In England and Wales, the right of an accused to be present in court at his trial is a matter of common law. The general rule was stated by Lord Reading CJ in R. v. Lee Kun (1916) 1 Kings Bench Reports 337, at 341, as follows:\n\u201cThere must be very exceptional circumstances to justify proceeding with the trial in the absence of the accused. The reason why the accused should be present at the trial is that he may hear the case made against him and have the opportunity ... of answering it. The presence of the accused means not only that he must be physically in attendance, but also that he must be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings.\u201c\n18. A trial judge may, if he considers that the accused in the dock may intimidate a witness, remove the accused from the presence of the witness, though not out of hearing (R. v. Smellie (1919) 14 Criminal Appeal Reports 128).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n19. The applicant lodged his application (no. 16757/90) with the Commission on 8 January 1990. He complained under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention that as he could not hear the proceedings which resulted in his conviction he did not receive a fair trial.\n20. On 10 February 1992 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint admissible.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n7. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007.\n8. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) introduced various new social-security payments, inter alia, Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance.\n9. Bereavement Payment is payable both to men and women in place of Widow\u2019s Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001. However, the amount is double the sum offered under the previous scheme. Bereavement Allowance replaced Widow\u2019s Pension. It is an allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the time of the spouse\u2019s death and where there are no dependent children. It is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement.\nTHE LAW\n### I.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 June 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At the material time, following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, an applicant had a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cthe AIT\u201d). Section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as inserted by section 81(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004) provided that a party to an appeal to the AIT could apply for an order that the AIT reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law.\n28. Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted, an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) stated that:\n\u201cWhen a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\n29. Where a person was not granted leave to enter the United Kingdom, he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State also had power to deport any person who was not a British citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d.\n### III. RELEVANT EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n30. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (\u201cthe Qualification Directive\u201d) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n31. On 17 October 2007 the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) asking, inter alia, whether article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.\n32. The ECJ held that article 15(c) protection went beyond that of Article 3 of the Convention, which was covered by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive. The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows:\n\u201cArticle 15(c) of the Directive, in conjunction with article 2(e) of the Directive, must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country or as the case may be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.\u201d\n33. In QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 620 the Court of Appeal observed that the ECJ in Elgafaji had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality, but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article 15(c). A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article 15(c) where the level of violence was such that, without anything to render them a particular target, civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety.\n34. More recently, in the case of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat, whether permissible under the laws or not, that seriously endangered non-combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive.\n### IV. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n35. It is a well-established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country. This principle is reflected both in article 8 of the Qualification Directive and paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay.\n36. In the cases of Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords held that the decision-maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so. In this regard, the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality, including in his former place of habitual residence. If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation, judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally, and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there. However, the more closely the persecution was linked to the State, and the greater the control of the State over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf, the more likely (other things being equal) that a victim of persecution in one place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same State.\n### V. RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMALIA\n#### A. Factual background\n37. The factual background to the conflict in Somalia, as described in the country reports at paragraphs 80 \u2013 188 below and subsequently agreed by the parties, is as follows.\n38. Somalia is comprised of three autonomous areas: the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the north west, the state of Puntland in the north east, and the remaining southern and central regions. Somali society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families, which are subdivided into clans and sub-clans. The four majority clans are Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq and Dir. In addition there are a number of minority groups, which are also divided into sub-groups. The Digli and Mirifle take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups.\n39. Somalia has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President Siad Barre by opposing clans in 1991. The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness, civil conflict and clan warfare followed. Mogadishu was fragmented into rival, clan-based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords. The Transitional Federal Government was established in October 2004 but a combination of internal divisions within the Transitional Federal Government and insecurity in central and southern Somalia hindered it from becoming a functioning Government. In June 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts, a union of various Sharia courts, took control of Mogadishu. Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of most of central and southern Somalia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 (2006) authorised the deployment of an African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development force to protect the Transitional Federal Government. Ethiopian ground and air forces also moved into Somalia to support the Transitional Federal Government and by late December 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts had been ousted from Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. Remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops.\n40. After the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts, the semblance of order and security that it had created in Mogadishu deteriorated. Roadblocks and checkpoints returned, as did banditry and violence. Furthermore, attacks by anti-government elements on Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces continued in Mogadishu, with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting. Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced. The fall of the Union of Islamic Courts also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra-clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued.\n41. In 2007 the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia was created when Somali Islamists and opposition leaders joined forces to fight the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces.\n42. On 20 August 2008 the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia signed a ceasefire agreement in Djibouti. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, the Islamic insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement, and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia.\n43. By late 2008 Islamist insurgents, including a group called al\u2011Shabaab, had regained control of most of southern Somalia.\n44. Somalia\u2019s Parliament met in Djibouti in January 2009 and swore in 149 new members from the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. The Parliament also extended the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government for another two years and installed moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as the new President.\n45. Ethiopia pulled its troops out of Somalia in January 2009. Soon after, al-Shabaab took control of Baidoa, formerly a key stronghold of the Transitional Federal Government. In May 2009 Islamist insurgents launched an attack on Mogadishu, prompting President Ahmad to appeal for help from abroad.\n46. In October 2009 al-Shabaab consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival, Hizbul Islam, out of the southern port city of Kismayo. Since then it has openly declared its alliance with al-Qaeda and has been steadily moving forces up towards Mogadishu.\n47. In December 2010 Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab merged.\n#### B. Parties to the conflict\n##### 1. The Transitional Federal Government\n48. The Transitional Federal Government is recognised by the United Nations and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of Somalia. However, it currently controls only a small section of Mogadishu centred on the port, the airport and the presidential palace. It is largely dependent on African Union troops for its survival.\n##### 2. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\n49. AMISOM is an African Union force authorised by the UN Security Council and deployed to Mogadishu to support the Transitional Federal Government. It currently consists of 5,300 Ugandan and Burundian troops.\n##### 3. Ethiopian forces\n50. Ethiopian forces joined the conflict in 2006 to help drive out the Union of Islamic Courts. They remained in Somalia until their withdrawal at the beginning of 2009.\n##### 4. Al-Shabaab\n51. Al-Shabaab began as part of the armed wing of the Union of Islamic Courts. When the 2006 Ethiopian military intervention sent the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts into exile, a hard core of al-Shabaab fighters remained in Somalia to fight. In their April 2010 report, \u201cHarsh War, Harsh Peace\u201d, Human Rights Watch indicated that al-Shabaab was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity, but the group\u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda: defeating AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government and extending Sharia law across Somalia. Some of its leaders have links with al-Qaeda although the extent of al-Qaeda\u2019s influence over al-Shabaab remains unclear.\n52. Al-Shabaab has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground, especially in southern Somalia. They have received material support from the Eritrean government, which is eager to undercut Ethiopia\u2019s interests in the region. By the end of 2009 al-Shabaab controlled more territory than any other faction in Somalia, including Baidoa, the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament, Jowhar, which had been one of the Transitional Federal Government President\u2019s most reliable strongholds, and the strategic port of Kismayo.\n53. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala on 11 July 2010, which killed 79 people watching the World Cup soccer final on television. It was al-Shabaab\u2019s first attack outside Somalia and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond.\n##### 5. Hizbul Islam\n54. Hizbul Islam is another armed group which has both a Sharia agenda and the goal of driving AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government from Mogadishu. In early 2009 it entered into an alliance with al-Shabaab but the alliance came to an end in October 2009 during the fight for Kismayo. In December 2010, however, it once again merged with al\u2011Shabaab.\n##### 6. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca\n55. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca is an Islamist group which professes to support a more moderate agenda. The group exists primarily in central Somalia, where it has maintained control over large strips of territory, predominantly in Galgadud and Hiran regions.\n56. In February 2010 Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca signed a power-sharing and military unification pact with the Transitional Federal Government, although at times relations between the two groups were strained.\n### VI. RELEVANT CASE LAW\n#### A. NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076\n57. In NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076 the AIT found that conditions in southern Somalia and particularly in and around Mogadishu were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of Article 3 ill-treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them. Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection, although individual circumstances required separate consideration. Although women were at greater risk than men, they would not be able to show that, simply as lone female returnees from the United Kingdom, they had no place of clan safety. Finally, the AIT held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in Somalia did not engage the obligations of the Refugee Convention or engage Article 3 of the Convention for all female returnees. A differential impact had to be shown. Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator.\n58. The AIT observed in passing that, on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing, it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an IDP camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under Article 3, if not under the Refugee Convention.\n#### B. HH and Others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022\n59. In HH and others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that for the purposes of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a situation of internal armed conflict existed in Mogadishu. The AIT held, however, that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians, they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and, as a consequence, a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area.\n60. The AIT found that although clan support networks were strained, they had not yet collapsed. Majority clans continued to have arms, even though their militias no longer controlled the city. A person from a majority clan, or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with, or acceptance by, a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance, including at times of displacement. A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at real risk of serious harm of being targeted by criminal elements, both in any area of former residence and in the likely event of being displaced. Members of minority groups found it harder to flee and move around to escape fighting, because they were not so easily accepted in new surroundings. The AIT found that persons displaced from their home in Mogadishu without being able to find a place elsewhere with clan members or friends would likely have to spend a significant period of time in a makeshift shelter, such as those along the road to Afgooye, or in an IDP camp, and could well experience treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention.\n61. Finally, the AIT held that the issue of whether a person from a minority clan would be able to find majority clan support would often need specific and detailed consideration. The evidence suggested that certain minority groups could be accepted by the majority clan of the area in question, so as to call on protection from that clan. On the current evidence, it might not be appropriate to assume that a finding of minority group status in southern Somalia was in itself sufficient to entitle a person to international protection, particularly where a person\u2019s credibility was otherwise lacking.\n#### C. AM and AM (armed conflict: risk categories) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00091\n62. In its most recent Somali Country Guidance determination, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal found that since its decision in HH there had been a number of significant changes in Somalia.\n63. First, the AIT found that by mid-2008 the armed conflict had spread beyond Mogadishu and its environs. The AIT therefore found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout central and southern Somalia. In respect of the intensity of the violence, the AIT noted that \u201cmanifestly all significant armed parties to the conflict have engaged in indiscriminate attacks\u201d. In particular, it noted that the Ethiopians were reported to have used means of war (firing inherently indiscriminate Katyusha rockets in urban areas) and methods of warfare (using mortars and indirect weapons without guidance in urban areas) that violated International Humanitarian Law. The TGF were reported to have engaged in aggression against civilians and to have acted \u201cas if they believe that they are immune from accountability, investigation or prosecution, including for crimes under international law\u201d. Moreover, reports indicated that insurgents had perpetrated raids, robberies and other abuses against civilians, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. The AIT referred to information received from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (\u201cIASC\u201d) which expressed concerns about:\n\u201cindiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas; indiscriminate use of roadside bombs and mortars from and in civilian areas; indiscriminate shooting in response to roadside bombs; arbitrary arrest and detention of civilians, including children; forced evictions; forced recruitment, including of children; sexual and gender based violence; intimidation and assassination of journalists, aid workers and civilian officials; and extra-judicial killings.\u201d\n64. The AIT also noted that the worsening security situation was coupled with a deteriorating humanitarian situation. It observed that between 400,000 and 750,000 people had been displaced from Mogadishu and that there had been significant displacements from other towns to which armed clashes had spread. The AIT also observed first, that IDPs experienced serious problems while on the move, which included checkpoints, threats, intimidation, looting, rape, abduction and harassment; secondly, that many did not end up in camps or makeshift settlements and consequently struggled to obtain shelter, food, water and sanitation; and thirdly, that the effect of displacement appeared to reduce the ability of IDPs to count on protection from their own clan: even where they fled to a traditional area for their clan, the pressures of numbers and scarce resources could mean that newcomers were not supported or absorbed by the local community.\n65. With regard to the situation in Mogadishu, the AIT considered that:\n\u201cthe movements of population out of Mogadishu in the past two years have been unprecedented. UN sources have estimated (at various times) that 400,000, up to as many as 750,000 (or around one third to a half), of the population of Mogadishu have been displaced. An 8 April 2008 Voice of America report states that two thirds of Mogadishu has been turned into an urban battleground. Since the beginning of 2008 there have been significantly fewer returns. Whatever the precise figures, it is clear that the ongoing violence has forced substantial numbers to flee the city more than once and flight seems an ongoing process: the IRIN report of 29 September 2008 cites Elman estimates that 18,500 people recently fled their homes due to the fighting and shelling (COIS, A 4). The COIS Reply dated 24 October 2008 states that: \u201c[a]ccording to the UNHCR an estimated 5,500 people were displaced from the city during the week and over 61,000 since 21 September 2008\u201d. Armed clashes have increasingly destroyed housing, market areas (Bakara market has been deliberately shelled) and infrastructure and the recent closure of the airport is likely to make matters in Mogadishu worse. According to Grayson and Munk, the aid community has been largely ineffective in providing the necessary aid to those who have stayed in Mogadishu (Nairobi evidence 65). They also state that Mogadishu is a \u201cghost town\u201d and that only the most vulnerable remain there.\u201d\n66. It concluded that since HH the situation in Mogadishu had changed significantly, both in terms of the extent of population displacement away from the city, the intensity of the fighting and the security conditions there. On the available evidence the AIT considered that Mogadishu was no longer safe as a place to live for the great majority of its citizens. It did not rule out that there might be certain individuals who on the facts might be considered to be able to live safely in the city, for example if they had close connections with powerful actors in Mogadishu, such as prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs. However, barring cases of this kind, in the case of persons found to come from Mogadishu who were returnees from the United Kingdom, the AIT found that they would face on return a real risk of persecution or serious harm and it was reasonably likely, if they tried staying there, that they would soon be forced to leave or that they would decide not to try to live there in the first place.\n67. Nevertheless, the AIT were not persuaded that the situation in central and southern Somalia had reached the threshold where civilians per se or Somali civilian IDPs per se could be said to face a real risk of persecution, serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention. First, although the levels of violence had increased in intensity, the numbers of those killed and wounded was not of great magnitude. Secondly, while the humanitarian situation was dire, it did not appear that civilians per se faced a real risk of denial of basic food and shelter and other bare necessities of life. Thirdly, while there was evidence of attacks on IDPs, in view of the huge numbers of people displaced (over a million according to some reports), it appeared that the great majority of IDPs were able to travel and subsist in IDP camps or settlements without serious setbacks.\n68. Rather, the AIT assessment of the extent to which IDPs would face greater or lesser hardships, at least outside Mogadishu, would vary depending on a number of factors. In particular, the AIT noted that IDPs from more influential clans appeared to have a better chance of being tolerated in the area to which they fled; IDPs with a traditional clan area that they could travel to, especially if they had close relatives or close clan affiliations in that area, appeared to have better prospects of finding safety and support (although not if the area concerned was already saturated with fellow IDPs); those who lacked recent experience of living in Somalia appeared more likely to have difficulty dealing with the changed environment in which clan loyalties had to some extent fractured; persons returning to their home area from the United Kingdom could be perceived as having relative wealth and might be more susceptible to extortion, abduction and the like; those who lived in areas not particularly affected by the fighting and which were not seen as strategically important to any of the main parties to the conflict would appear less subject to security problems; women and girls faced the additional risks of rape, abduction and harassment; the prevailing economic conditions in the area would also be relevant, bearing in mind Somalia\u2019s history of droughts, poor harvests and rising food prices.\n69. The AIT recognised that there had been a significant change in the clan-based character of Somali society since HH was promulgated. Clan protection was not as effective as it had been in the early 1990s and conflicts over scarce resources had complicated the situation and made it unpredictable. This did not mean, however, that the clan or sub-clan had ceased to be the primary entity to which individuals turned for protection.\n70. As regards internal relocation, whether those whose home area was Mogadishu (or indeed any other part of central and southern Somalia) would be able to relocate in safety and without undue hardship would depend on the evidence as to the general circumstances in the relevant parts of central and southern Somalia and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Whether or not it was likely that relocation would mean that they had to live in an IDP camp would be an important but not necessarily a decisive factor.\n71. The AIT considered the safety of en route travel from Mogadishu International Airport, which was the point of return for anyone being removed to central and southern Somalia. The AIT noted that:\n\u201cThe airport is one of the facilities patrolled by AMISON troops (COIS, 27.13). According to Somalia Humanitarian Overview, September 2008, normally at least 5 commercial flights arrive and depart on a weekly basis to and from the rest of Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Dubai. The COIS Reply of 24 October 2008 notes that it is expected in the next month or so that thousands will leave via MIA to perform Haj in Saudi Arabia. At the time of HH, the airport was fully operational with flights arriving and departing regularly. However in 2008 the situation has been unsettled. There were attacks of some kind in January 2008 and the downing of a plane by a missile in March 2008 (COIS, 27.13). The airport was attacked by insurgents on 1 June 2008 as the President\u2019s plane left for talks in Djibouti. On 14 September 2008 a group identifying themselves as Al Shabab threatened to shut the airport down, although a counter-report from Union of Islamic Courts said that the Islamist forces did not intend to close it. It was closed on 16 September. On 28 September there were mortar attacks on it upon the arrival of an AMISON military plane (COIS, A.2). A Press TV cutting dated 2 October 2008 states that 5 heavy mortars landed inside MIA injuring a number of soldiers. The assailants apparently targeted a plane trying to land. A COIS Reply dated 15 October 2008 reports an Al Shabab source as saying that on 9 October a civilian plane carrying 120 Somali deportees from Saudi Arabia managed to land without incident. A 13 October press report refers to several mortar attacks on the airport. We were told by the respondent at the outset of the hearing that removals to Somalia were temporarily suspended because of travel documentation problems, but it may well be, in the light of these recent developments, that for the immediate future at least, there would be difficulties in ensuring safe arrival in any event.\u201d\n72. In HH the AIT had concluded that those moving around Mogadishu and the environs would in general not be at risk of serious harm at checkpoints, although it left open the possibility that the situation might be different if a person were likely to encounter a non-Transitional Federal Government checkpoint alone, without friends, family or other clan members. However, in AM the AIT noted that from the second half of 2007 United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimate of the number of roadblocks/checkpoints in central and southern Somalia showed an increase from 238 in July 2007 to 400 in July 2008 and considerably more than half were under the control of insurgents. Nevertheless, while the AIT found that the Transitional Federal Government appeared by and large to have lost control of many of the roadblocks and checkpoints in central and southern Somalia, the evidence continued to indicate that they retained control of the main road from the airport into Mogadishu. While there was some evidence that the road came under attack from insurgents on a daily basis, there was clearly a great deal of ongoing movement of people along the roads in central and southern Somalia and in and around the airport and the AIT did not consider that the available evidence demonstrated a real risk en route of persecution or serious harm for travellers from the airport to Mogadishu.\n#### D. HH (Somalia), AM (Somalia), J (Somalia) and MA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426\n73. One of the applicants in HH and one of the applicants in AM were granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Their appeals were joined to those of two other Somali applicants.\n74. HH contended that the AIT had erred in its application of the provisions of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive as it had held first, that the notion of an \u201cindividual threat\u201d required a \u201cdifferential impact \u201d and secondly, that article 15(c) did not add anything to Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. Before the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State for the Home Department accepted that the AIT had erred in its interpretation of article 15(c), but submitted that the error was not material. The Court of Appeal held that if the correct (post-Elgafaji) approach to article 15(c) had been applied to the facts found by the AIT, it was inevitable that it would have found that the population of Mogadishu as a whole was not subject to such a high level of indiscriminate violence as to justify the conclusion that merely to be there attracted entitlement to subsidiary protection. Consequently, the Court of Appeal dismissed HH\u2019s appeal on the ground that the error of law was not material.\n75. The AIT had accepted that AM was from Jowhar. It noted that there was no longer any significant fighting there but accepted that there was evidence that en route travel to Jowhar was hazardous. Nevertheless, the AIT held that it was not empowered to consider the risk faced in making the journey: rather, it was for the Secretary of State for the Home Department, in finalising the removal arrangements, to satisfy herself that there would be safe en route travel for AM. AM appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that this was not a lawful approach. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that in any case in which it could be shown either directly or by implication what route and method of return was envisaged, the AIT was required by law to consider and determine any challenge to the safety of that route or method. The AIT therefore fell into error as it had declined to consider AM\u2019s safety on return. The Court of Appeal remitted the case to the AIT to consider this issue.\n76. J had sought judicial review of the Secretary of State for the Home Department\u2019s refusal to accept as a fresh claim her submissions about the situation facing her were she to be returned to Somalia. The Administrative Court had held that if the removal directions had indicated that J was expected to go by road from Mogadishu International Airport to her home town, the evidence would have given her a strongly arguable case for judicial review. However, as the detail or method of return was neither clearly nor necessarily implicit within the immigration decision, the judicial review application had been refused. J appealed to the Court of Appeal. For the same reasons adopted in AM\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. The Court of Appeal indicated (on an obiter basis) that the Qualification Directive and the Asylum Procedures Directive read together required that the issues of safety during return (as opposed to technical obstacles during return) should be considered as part of the decision on entitlement. Only technical obstacles could legitimately be deferred to the point at which removal directions were being made or considered. If there was a real issue of safety on return the Secretary of State had to engage with it in his decision on entitlement to protection. If he failed to do so, the appeal tribunal would have to deal with the issue. In any case, the decision on entitlement had to be made within a reasonable time and could not be left until the Secretary of State was in a position to set safe removal directions.\n77. MA appealed against the rejection of his Article 3 claims by the AIT. In particular, he complained that the AIT had misdirected itself because it had focused on his failure to tell the truth when it should have asked whether there was evidence relating to his own particular situation, even ignoring his own rejected testimony, which would support his contention that there was a real risk on return. The Court of Appeal accepted that the AIT had adopted the wrong approach, apparently considering that the applicant\u2019s lies had disabled it from reaching a conclusion on the Article 3 risk. Had it made an assessment on the basis of the available evidence, it would have had to have concluded that the applicant was at risk of Article 3 ill-treatment on return. The Court of Appeal noted that following AM, the Country Guidance relating to Mogadishu was such that most potential returnees would be entitled to subsidiary protection under article 15 of the Qualification Directive. It therefore followed that only those Somalis who could get without undue risk to a place of safety or who had access to protection against the endemic dangers could properly be deported or returned. It was accepted that MA was from a minority clan, that he had not been in Somalia for 15 years, and that for much of that time he had been in detention. There was therefore sufficient evidence before the AIT to at least establish a real risk that he would not have the necessary contacts in Mogadishu to afford him the necessary protection.\n#### E. AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC)\n78. In AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that the First Tier Tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the applicant could safely reach his home area of Afgooye from Mogadishu International Airport. However, on reconsideration the Tribunal was not satisfied that returning him would give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In particular, it found that travel took place with some degree of frequency from the airport to the city of Mogadishu and into other areas of Somalia; that as the applicant had lived in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, he would be well able to anticipate and comply with the requirements of al-Shabaab; that there was nothing which would put him at any risk were he to encounter a Transitional Federal Government checkpoint; that the evidence did not support a finding that all men or young men were at risk of forced recruitment by al-Shabaab; and, that as the applicant was not found to be a minority clan member, and as his uncle had been able to fund his departure from Somalia, he would be able to avoid foreseeable risks and pay the relatively modest sums demanded at checkpoints.\n#### F. Judgment of 24 February 2011 (UM 10061-09) of the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal (Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen)\n79. The Swedish Migration Court of Appeal, which is the court of final instance in immigration cases, found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout the whole of southern and central Somalia which was sufficiently serious to expose the Somali applicant to a risk of serious harm, even though he could not demonstrate that he would be specifically targeted. The court had regard to many reports which indicated that the fighting had increased in recent months and that the situation had become very unstable and unpredictable. Moreover, due to the worsening security situation, the presence of the United Nations and other international organisations had decreased and, as a consequence, detailed and updated information was hard to come by. Although the safety level in Somaliland and Puntland was considered to be acceptable, a Somali returnee could only gain admittance to those areas if he was seen as belonging or having another connection to them. As that was not the case with the applicant, the court concluded that he could not internally relocate and that he should thus be given a residence permit and subsidiary protection in Sweden.\n### VII. RELEVANT COUNTRY INFORMATION\n#### A. United Kingdom Government Reports\n##### 1. Somalia: Report of Fact-Finding Mission to Nairobi,\n8 \u2013 15 September 2010\n80. The fact-finding mission interviewed a number of anonymous sources, including international NGOs, security advisors and diplomatic sources, about the current security and humanitarian situation in southern and central Somalia. In particular, the mission sought to obtain information on which groups controlled which areas, how easy it was to travel between different areas, the security and human rights situation, and the conditions in the IDP camps.\n81. Sources indicated that control of Mogadishu was divided between the Transitional Federal Government, backed by AMISOM troops, and\nal-Shabaab. Although the sources had different views on which groups controlled which districts, they mostly agreed that the Transitional Federal Government controlled the airport, the seaport, Villa Somalia and the road between the airport and Villa Somalia.\n82. Sources indicated that the security situation in Mogadishu was poor, with thousands of civilians killed in the fighting between AMISOM and\nal-Shabaab. Areas controlled by al-Shabaab were at risk of shelling by AMISOM, while areas controlled by AMISOM were at risk of shelling by al-Shabaab. All parties to the conflict were guilty of indiscriminate shelling. Violence was sporadic and rape was an issue in many areas. Consequently, there was a constant movement of IDPs into and out of the city. However, one diplomatic source suggested that it would be possible to live in\nnon-conflict areas of the city, which were generally considered to be safe.\n83. Sources also indicated that the nature of al-Shabaab violence had become more sophisticated over the past twelve months as foreign fighters had brought with them new tactics and techniques. They not only carried out targeted attacks against AMISOM troops and Transitional Federal Government ministers and MPs, but they also carried out random killings of civilians in Mogadishu in order to create disorder and chaos.\n84. The report noted that there were regular flights into Somalia, most of which were destined for Mogadishu International Airport. The EU Special Representative informed the Mission that 15-18 flights arrived in Mogadishu each day. An airplane captain working for African Express Airways also told the Mission that his airline had carried 12,000 passengers into Mogadishu in the first eight months of 2010.\n85. The road between the airport and Mogadishu was controlled by the Transitional Federal Government with AMISOM support and these groups managed all checkpoints along the route. It would not be particularly dangerous for ordinary Somalis unless they found themselves \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. However, there were reports of a failed attack on the airport on 9 September 2010 and some sources suggested that contacts were required in order to make the journey from the airport. The EU Special Representative for the EU Delegation on Somalia indicated that those members of the diaspora who regularly travelled to Mogadishu were\nwell-connected and that mobility was limited unless the individual was aligned with a militia. Likewise, a representative from an international NGO indicated that \u201cany Somalis returning to Mogadishu International Airport would need a lot of preparation and would need to ensure they had contacts in Mogadishu\u201d.\n86. A representative from one international NGO suggested that al-Shabaab knew who was landing at the airport as they were receiving information from Transitional Federal Government soldiers based there.\n87. Most of the sources interviewed agreed that Somalis were able to move around within Mogadishu without much restriction. Two sources described the checkpoints in the city as \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cvariable\u201d as they tended to change according to fighting areas and the level of control of specific groups. One source suggested that checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government or Hizbul Islam were more difficult to negotiate as they were operated with less discipline and normally demanded money. Al-Shabaab checkpoints normally checked that people were obeying their code of behaviour and would therefore stop women travelling alone. Some individuals operating these checkpoints would punish those who were not acting according to al-Shabaab\u2019s rules.\n88. Contrary to the majority opinion, the EU Special Representative informed the fact-finding mission that all civilians in Mogadishu would either be aligned to a militia or completely unable to get out of the town. The Special Representative even suggested that some Somalis were unable to leave their own district.\n89. There was no consensus on which groups controlled the other regions in southern and central Somalia, although all agreed that al-Shabaab controlled most of the land south of a line drawn between Beletweyne and Dhusarmareb. Militias broadly aligned with the Transitional Federal Government controlled pockets of land on the Ethiopian border. Hizbul Islam was nominally in control of some small areas, including parts of the Afgooye Corridor, but al-Shabaab\u2019s influence in these areas was significant. Finally, the region of Galmudug was controlled by a local clan-based administration which acted under the umbrella of Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca.\n90. Outside Mogadishu, people were generally permitted to travel within the areas controlled by al-Shabaab although they could encounter difficulties at checkpoints if they were not obeying al-Shabaab rules. Although al-Shabaab had endeavoured to remove \u201cillegal\u201d checkpoints, a number of sources indicated that some clan militia checkpoints remained. The evidence appeared to suggest that it was possible to negotiate the various checkpoints, although a certain amount of risk was involved.\n91. A diplomatic source stated that young men travelling in al-Shabaab held areas could be targeted by al-Shabaab for recruitment. This was supported by an international NGO, which advised that forced recruitment was becoming systematic. Young men were asked to register with\nal-Shabaab, including those who were stopped at checkpoints.\n92. A number of sources considered the areas controlled by al-Shabaab to be stable and generally safe for those Somalis who were able to \u201cplay the game\u201d and avoid the unnecessary attention of al-Shabaab. One the other hand, one international NGO believed that there were \u201cno safe areas in southern-central Somalia as long as al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam were present\u201d. Another NGO indicated that everywhere in southern and central Somalia had been affected by violations of international humanitarian law and by a situation of generalised violence and displacement over the past three years on account of the expansion of the insurgency outside Mogadishu. Finally, a diplomatic source stated that \u201ceverywhere is volatile and can change at any time\u201d.\n93. With regard to the human rights situation, forced recruitment of adults and children appeared to be an emerging problem, particularly for those displaced in the Afgooye Corridor. Sources suggested that all parties to the conflict recruited children, although it was not certain that the Transitional Federal Government forcibly recruited them. Child recruitment was, however, very common in al-Shabaab areas, as they would forcibly recruit the eldest son from local families, some of whom were as young as ten years old. Adult males were also forced to register with al-Shabaab in Merca and Doble.\n94. Moreover, the sources indicated that in al-Shabaab areas, human rights were practically non-existent because of the organisation\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law, which was not in accordance with the beliefs of ordinary Somalis. Consequently, people lived in fear as there were serious punishments if al-Shabaab orders were not obeyed. Women in particular were routinely targeted and were not permitted to engage in trade. In addition, al-Shabaab had made a concerted effort to drive NGOs out of its areas by a number of means, including demanding payment of a \u201cregistration fee\u201d of up to USD 15,000, looting warehouses and threatening workers. In some cases al-Shabaab had stolen aid and confiscated the assets of NGOs to sell for profit. There was therefore no international NGO presence in al-Shabaab controlled areas and health and feeding programmes had been stopped, with significant consequences for the civilian population.\n95. Finally, sources were asked about the conditions in IDP camps. They indicated that although those with resources had left Mogadishu, there were some 250,000 people displaced within the city and no humanitarian assistance was available to them. Estimates suggested that there were a further 200,000 to 500,000 people in the Afgooye Corridor, which had become increasingly urbanised. It was difficult to give an exact number of the people based in the corridor because, due to the nature of the fighting, a lot of people were going back and forward to Mogadishu. Moreover, access for NGOs was difficult as the corridor was controlled by \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who controlled who and what moved into and out of the area. These \u201cgatekeepers\u201d tended to be opportunists who were not aligned to any particular group but they were able to make assistance from NGOs very difficult. Two NGOs said that it was incredibly difficult to access the corridor and, where access was possible, aid was often diverted. Moreover, landlords in the area were either selling the land that the IDPs", "001-91088": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BOOTH v.

The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt and WMA constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 6 May and 16 September 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of other serious offences (e.g. manslaughter or rape) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside.\n#### B. Tariffs\n13. Over the years, the Secretary of State has adopted a \u201ctariff\u201d policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 505-507). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The \u201ctariff\u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Secretary of State will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Ex parte V. and T., [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp. 492G-493A).\n14. Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After expiry of the tariff, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board which has the power to order release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public.\n15. A different regime, however, applies under the 1991 Act to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. In relation to these prisoners, the Secretary of State decides the length of the tariff. The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial, as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view (R. v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Walker v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 March 2004 and 11 July 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26).\n16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%.\n17. Section 6(2) of the Act provides that only those under the state pension age are liable to pay NICs from their earnings. The state pension ages are currently set as 65 for men and 60 for women according to section 122.\n18. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The state pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay NICs will gradually increase in line with the increase in the state pension age.\n### III. EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n19. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits\u201d.\n20. In the Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (\u201cthe EOC case\u201d concerning reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that:\n\u2022 Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference;\n\u2022 Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age;\n\u2022 In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 December 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended the disciplinary and court-martial procedures regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955. References below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to the Army Act 1955 as amended. The statutory disciplinary provisions applicable to armed forces personnel are contained in the above-listed three \u201cservice discipline Acts\u201d. Each Act specifies, in virtually identical terms, the offences for which persons subject to that Act can be tried and the punishments applicable. Persons subject to armed forces law are thereby subjected to a common code of offences and punishments.\n#### A. The Offence\n20. The offences triable under the 1955 Act include misconduct in action; offences by or in relation to sentries, person on watch etc; failure to attend for, neglect of, duty; looting; mutiny and related offences; insubordinate behaviour; disobedience of a lawful command or standing order; desertion, absence without leave and related offences; malingering, drunkenness, disorderly conduct and fighting; refusal to submit to drug testing; false statements on entry or enlistment; offences harmful to morale; scandalous or disgraceful behaviour; ill-treatment of persons of inferior rank and conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (see sections 24-68 of the 1955 Act).\n21. In addition to the above, any person subject to armed forces law who commits a civilian offence (any act punishable by the laws of England) is also guilty of an offence against the service discipline Acts (section 70 of the 1955 Act).\n22. Section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cAny person subject to military law who - ...\n(b) uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer\nshall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.\u201d\n#### B. Summary trial: investigations\n23. Section 76 of the 1955 Act provides that an allegation that an accused has committed an offence, including the offence cited above, shall be reported to his commanding officer (\u201cCO\u201d). Regulation 25 of the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Regulations\u201d - enacted under section 83 of the 1955 Act) provides that COs shall investigate the charge by, inter alia, causing such enquiries to be made as appear necessary. Following investigation, the CO may dismiss the charge, refer the charge to a higher authority or deal with it summarily.\n#### C. Summary trial: hearings\n24. Regulation 9 of the 1997 Regulations notes that COs may deal summarily with any charge under section 33 of the 1955 Act. Before dealing summarily with a charge, a CO shall, inter alia, call witnesses whose evidence he considers may be relevant to the charge, allow the accused to question those witnesses, allow the accused to give evidence on his own behalf and allow the accused to call his own witnesses (Regulation 29 of the 1997 Regulations). The CO had to either hear evidence orally himself or cause it to be reduced to writing. The latter was obligatory if it was considered that extended detention could be awarded on any finding of guilt (see \u201cPenalties\u201d at paragraph 28 below).\n25. If, having heard the evidence, the CO finds that the charge has been proved, the CO shall, before so recording, afford the accused the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial (Section 76B of the 1955 Act). If the accused does not so elect, the CO can, inter alia, record a finding of guilty and award penalties.\n26. While an accused cannot be legally represented at the CO hearing, Chapter 62 of the Army General Administrative Instructions (\u201cAGAIs\u201d) describes the Accused\u2019s Adviser procedure. The Adviser acts in the accused\u2019s best interests but is not to be considered a form of defence lawyer and is not legally qualified. An Adviser\u2019s function is limited to advising the accused before and at the hearing (for example, as regards whether to elect trial by court-martial) and making a statement during the trial about the accused\u2019s background and in mitigation. Detailed guidance for the Accused\u2019 Adviser is set out at Annex M to Chapter 62, including on the procedure for electing trial by court-martial and the advice to be given to an accused in that respect.\n#### D. Penalties\n27. The maximum duration of the imprisonment for the offence of using insubordinate language is not defined under the 1955 Act.\n28. By virtue of Regulation 12 of the 1997 Regulations, a CO dealing summarily with an offence can make an award of detention not exceeding 28 days unless he complies with Regulation 31 of the 1997 Regulations. That Regulation provides that a CO may award extended detention (up to 60 days) if he has taken written statements from all the witnesses (Regulation 31(3)), satisfied himself that the accused was not likely to dispute the charge (Regulation 31(4)), obtained permission from a higher authority to award extended detention (Regulation 31(5) and (7)) and informed the accused of his extended powers (Regulation 31(9)).\n29. A district court-martial can award imprisonment of up to two years (section 85(2) of the 1955 Act). There is no upward limit on the awards of imprisonment of a general court-martial.\n#### E. The Pamphlet\n30. All soldiers are provided with a pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Rights of a Soldier Charged with an Offence under the Army Act 1955\u201d. The pamphlet was amended on 1 October 1997 following the entry into force of the 1996 Act.\n31. The post-October 1997 version of the pamphlet submitted by the Government in the present case informs soldiers of their right to have an Accused\u2019s Adviser both before and during the hearing, of the role of the Adviser (see paragraph 26 above), the procedure at the hearing, the penalties available, the procedure for applying for extended detention powers, the means of electing for trial by court-martial (including when and how much time is accorded to decide), the time available to withdraw any such election and the consequences of such an election (including the possibility of being prosecuted on more serious charges).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n32.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 April 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person\u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness.\n23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right:\n\u201cOf more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law.\nThe case of Harrison v. Carswell (1975) 62 D.L.R. 3d 68 in the Supreme Court of Canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre, against the wishes of the owner of the centre. The majority of the Supreme Court held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. However, Laskin C.J.C., in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public, the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner\u2019s whim. He said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and \u2013\n\u2019If it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.\u2019\nI have already said that this was a dissenting judgment. Nevertheless counsel [for the applicants] submitted that we should apply it in the present case. I accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary. However there is no such necessity where Parliament has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by section 18 of the Highways Act 1971 and section 35 of the Highways Act 1980. (Harrison v. Carswell makes no mention of any similar legislation in Canada.) Where Parliament has legislated and the Council, as representing the public, chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides, it is not for the courts to intervene.\nI would allow this appeal ... on the basis that CIN had the right, subject only to the issue under section 20 of the Race Relations Act 1976, to determine any licence the [applicants] may have had to enter the Centre.\u201d\n### III. CASES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS\n24. The parties have referred to case-law from the United States and Canada.\n#### A. The United States\n25. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.\n26. The United States Supreme Court has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places, such as streets and parks, known as \u201cpublic fora\u201d for the exercise of free speech (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organisation, 307 U.S. (United States: Supreme Court Reports) 496 (1939)). In Marsh v. Alabama (326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. (Supreme Court Reporter) 276, 90 L.Ed. (United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers\u2019 Edition) 265 (1946)), the Supreme Court also held that a privately owned corporate town (a company town) having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the First Amendment rights of free speech and peaceable assembly. It has found that the First Amendment does not require access to privately owned properties, such as shopping centres, on the basis that there has to be \u201cState action\u201d (a degree of State involvement) for the amendment to apply (see, for example, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976)).\n27. The United States Supreme Court has taken the position that the First Amendment does not prevent a private shopping-centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations (Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 47 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed. 2d 131 (1972)). This did not however prevent State constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the Federal Constitution to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping-centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions (Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robbins, 447 U.S. 74, 64 L.Ed. 2d 741, 100 S.Ct. 2035 (1980)).\n28. Some State courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their State constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures (see, for example, Batchelder v. Allied Stores Int\u2019l, N.E. (West\u2019s North Eastern Reporter) 2d 590 (Massachussetts, 1983); Lloyd Corp. v. Whiffen, 849 P. (West\u2019s Pacific Reporter) 2d 446, 453-54 (Oregon, 1993); Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., 780 P. 2d 1282 (Washington, 1989)). Some cases found State obligations arising due to State involvement, for example, Bock v. Westminster Mall Co., 819 P. 2d 55 (Colorado, 1991) (the shopping centre was a State actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas), and Jamestown v. Beneda, 477 N.W. (West\u2019s North Western Reporter) 2d 830 (North Dakota, 1991) (where the ", "001-60649": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF BENJAMIN and WILSON v.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 5 September 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Transfer and restriction directions on prisoners under the Mental Health Act 1983\n19. Under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d), the Secretary of State may transfer a person serving a sentence of imprisonment to hospital if he is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment, and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, and, in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition. A transfer under section 47 of the 1983 Act is called a \u201ctransfer direction\u201d, and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under section 37 (1) of the 1983 Act (that is, where a court convicts a person and, instead of sentencing him, orders his detention in hospital).\n20. At the same time as making a transfer direction, the Secretary of State may also make a \u201crestriction direction\u201d under section 49 of the 1983 Act. A restriction direction has the same effect as a restriction order made by a court under section 41 of the 1983 Act on conviction, save that because the person was not given a hospital order by the court, the Secretary of State must consent to his discharge from hospital, as well as to the granting of leave of absence or transfer to another hospital.\n21. A transferred life prisoner subject to restriction directions can be discharged from hospital in three possible ways. Each can be initiated only by the Secretary of State.\n(1) Section 42 (2) of the 1983 Act gives the Secretary of State power, if he thinks fit, by warrant to discharge the patient either absolutely or subject to conditions.\n(2) Section 50 of the 1983 Act provides that where the Secretary of State is notified by the responsible medical officer, and other registered practitioner or a Mental Health Review Tribunal that the person no longer requires treatment in hospital for mental disorder, or that no effective treatment for the disorder can be given in the hospital, the Secretary of State may remit the person to a prison or to a different institution, or he may exercise any power of releasing or discharging him which would have been exercisable if he had been so remitted.\n(3) Under Section 74 of the 1983 Act,\n\u201c(1) Where an application to a Mental Health Review Tribunal is made by a restricted patient who is subject to a restriction direction, or where the case of such a patient is referred to such a tribunal, the tribunal -\n(a) shall notify the Secretary of State whether, in their opinion, the patient would, if subject to a restriction order, be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged under Section 73 ...; and\n(b) if they notify him that the patient would be entitled to be conditionally discharged, may recommend that in the event of his not being discharged under this section he should continue to be detained in hospital.\n(2) If in the case of a patient not falling within subsection (4) below-\n(a) the tribunal notify the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged; and\n(b) within the period of 90 days beginning with the date of that notification the Secretary of State gives notice to the tribunal that the patient may be so discharged,\nthe tribunal shall direct the absolute or, as the case may be, the conditional discharge of the patient.\n...\n(4) If, in the case of a patient who is subject to a transfer direction under Section 48 above, the tri", "001-60736": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SALOMONSSON v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Salomonsson v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr M. Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n23. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK).\n#### B. Procedure\n24. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court.\n25. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n26. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n27. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court had constituted a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n29. The Government claimed that it had been justified to dispense with an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 March, 11 July and 12 December 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Pertinent Constitutional provisions\n17. Article 38(1) of the Irish Constitution provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. By Article 40, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.\n#### B. The Offences Against the State Act 1939\n18. The Offences Against the State Act 1939 (\u201cthe 1939 Act\u201d) is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts.\n19. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act.\n20. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances\u2019 legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date.\n22. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act.\n23. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the [police] may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person\u2019s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.\n2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the [police], fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\u201d\n24. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the Government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has, with Government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The Committee has commenced its work.\n#### C. Relevant case-law\n25. In the case of the People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan (1979 IR 45) the accused had been arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act and had made certain statements to the police. The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest (section 30), the existence of section 52 of the 1939 Act and even though no section 52 requests had actually been made, the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements. Accordingly, the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible. The Court did not find this argument persuasive since no section 52 requests had in fact been made. It went to point out that, even if section 52 had been invoked by the police, the defence submission was not well-founded because of previous Irish case-law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with Irish law, even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer, were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings.\n26. The Garda Siochana (police) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in association with the Garda Siochana. The commentary on section 52 of the 1939 Act in the sixth edition (1991) provides as follows:\n\u201cThe fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section 52 does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence\u201d\nThe judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the above-cited McGowan case and the earlier Irish case-law approved in the McGowan case.\n27. In the case of Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General ([1994] 2 ILRM), two individuals had been sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act for failing to give an account of their movements. The High Court rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of section 52, considering that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with those persons\u2019 right to silence guaranteed by Article 38 of the Constitution: the objective was to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State; the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational; and other legal protections were available to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act which minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act.\nThose protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligatory informing of the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act.\nThe Supreme Court rejected the appeal (Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General [1996] IR 580). It noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the question of the later use of statements made pursuant to requests of the police under that section. While it noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in the above-cited McGowan case that information lawfully obtained under Section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not.\nThe Supreme Court pointed out that the right to silence was a corollary to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. The relevant assessment was, therefore, to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made under section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force.\nAs to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those, with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime, to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order.\n28. In the case of National Irish Bank Ltd (In the matter of National Irish Bank Ltd and the Companies Act 1990, 1999 1 ILRM 321, at 343) the Supreme Court found that a confession of a bank official obtained by Inspectors as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under Section 10 of the Companies Act 1990 would not, in general, be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless, in any particular case, the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary. The Supreme Court considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under section 52 of the 1939 Act would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.\nTHE LAW\ni. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that section 52 of the 1939 Act violated his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. Article 6, in so far as is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...\n2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s submissions\n30. The Government submitted, in the first place, that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. He had, for reasons outlined by the Government, a fair trial in respect of his conviction under section 52 of the 1939 Act. Since Article 6 provides protection of a procedural nature for the determination of a criminal charge, the applicant could not rely on Article 6 to challenge the offence under section 52 itself. In addition, no proceedings were taken against him on charges of membership of an illegal organisation so that he could not, in that respect, complain of a violation of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government also disputed that the applicant could be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 as interpreted by the Serves judgment: the applicant had assumed wrongly that, when he was questioned under section 52, a case existed against him which the police sought to prove as in the Serves case. When questions were put to the present applicant under section 52, no decision had been taken to charge him with any particular crime.\n31.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n35. The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, 18 September 2012.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained of a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because of an alleged failure of the authorities to put in place the necessary resources to enable him to demonstrate to the Parole Board that his risk had reduced and a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on the ground that his Parole Board review in 2011 was, in these circumstances, a meaningless exercise. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 read as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court ....\n...\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n37. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint essentially concerns adequate access to courses and that it is appropriate to examine it from the angle of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention only (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above).\n38. The Government contested the argument that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in the case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n39. The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies since he had not commenced judicial review proceedings alleging a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In the alternative, they invited the Court to declare the applicant\u2019s complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. Citing Hall v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24712/12, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2013, they argued that the applicant had been given access to numerous courses and assessments both pre- and post-tariff and that his post-tariff detention could therefore not be considered \u201carbitrary\u201d.\n40. The applicant maintained that he had satisfied Article 35 \u00a7 1, since any judicial review claim would have failed on account of the House of Lords\u2019 refusal to find a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in James, Wells and Lee. He also refuted the suggestion that his case was similar to the Hall case, emphasising that he had been given no access whatsoever to courses between September 2010 and May 2012.\n41.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201cpending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter\u201d (Schedule 2, paragraph 16). Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention. It is a form of licensed consent to enter the United Kingdom which may be subjected to conditions, including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person\u2019s residence, employment or occupation (Schedule 2, paragraph 21).\n18. In general (that is, in cases other than those involving Oakington), the SSHD\u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding.\n19. On 16 March 2000 Barbara Roche MP, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new Oakington Reception Centre. Oakington asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018quickly\u2019, including those which may be certified as being \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019. To assist immigration officers, lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at Oakington could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with. It was said that Oakington would strengthen the ability of the Home Office to deal quickly with asylum applications.\n20. Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for Oakington detention. Cases in which detention at Oakington would not be suitable included the following:\n- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors;\n- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers;\n- cases in which there was a dispute as to age;\n- disabled applicants;\n- persons with special medical needs;\n- cases involving disputes as to nationality; and\n- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative.\n21. In addition, all persons believed to be at risk of absconding (from Oakington) were not deemed suitable for detention at Oakington.\n22. The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, social visits room and a religious observance room. The following description was used in the present case:\n\u201cAll of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant, medical centre, social visits room, religious observance and recreation. The practical operation and facilities at Oakington are, however, very different from other detention centres. In particular, there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security, reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications. The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space. Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although, in the interests of privacy and safety, there are two areas where only females and families may go.\u201d\n23. The \u2018House Rules\u2019 for Oakington require, inter alia, that detainees must vacate or return to their room when required; that mail may be required to be opened in front of officers; that detainees must eat at set times and that visits can only be received at particular times. Further, detainees must carry identification at all times (to be shown to officers on request); must obey all staff and attend roll-calls. Male detainees are accommodated separately from their spouses and children and cannot stay with them overnight.\nTHE LAW\n### I . ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant contended that his detention at the Oakington Reception Centre from 2 to 9 January 2001 was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. That provision reads, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government accepted that the applicant\u2019s stay at Oakington constituted a \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d for the purposes of Article 5. They considered, however, that the wording of the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) \u2013 detention \u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d - described the factual state of affairs where a person was seeking to effect an entry but had no authorisation, that being a matter under consideration by the State of entry, and that it did not require the additional feature of an attempted evasion of immigration control. If it were otherwise \u2013 that is, if a person who applied for asylum could not be detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because he was seeking to effect an authorised, rather than an unauthorised entry \u2013 States would be required to authorise entry to all who seek it. It would not even be possible to detain for short periods to make arrangements and verify identity.\n26. The Government also contested the applicant\u2019s thesis that asylum seekers may only be detained where detention is \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to prevent the person absconding or otherwise misbehaving. They noted that Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) contains such a provision, but Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not, and underlined that in the context of detention with a view to deportation, the Court confirmed such an interpretation in Chahal (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 112). The Government considered that the conclusion in Chahal, which was confirmed in \u010conka (\u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2002-I), applies equally to detention with a view to preventing unauthorised detention.\n27. Finally, the Government contended that, in any event, the applicant\u2019s detention was not disproportionate in the circumstances: it was only possible to interview large numbers of applicants in a short time-frame if the applicants were available at short or no notice; the use of nationality as a criterion for choosing candidates for Oakington was only one of a number of criteria and was perfectly proper and justified, and the applicant\u2019s contention that the use of detention was influenced by the reaction of local residents and planning committees was not made out, as the domestic courts which considered the point had also found.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant maintained his claim that to detain a person who presented no threat to immigration control simply in order to accelerate a decision concerning their entry did not \u201cprevent\u201d unauthorised entry, and was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f): there was no risk of the applicant absconding, and indeed Oakington was only used to detain those who were not at risk of absconding. Article 5 \u00a71 (f) did not, however, prevent detention, for example, while an assessment was being made of whether an individual presented an unacceptable risk of absconding and thereby effecting an unauthorised entry.\n29. The applicant underlined that the detention in his case was wholly unrelated to whether he was granted entry: he was granted temporary admission both before and after the period of detention in question, and entry at those times was not \u201cunauthorised\u201d. After a person has been assessed not to present a risk of absconding, examination of his claim and immigration control could be carried out without detention.\n30. For the applicant, detention was such a serious measure that it was only justified where other, less severe measures had been considered and found to be insufficient. The applicant cited with approval the first instance judge who said \u201cSurely measures short of detention should be tried first and detention should be regarded as the last resort\u201d.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles of detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f)\n31. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) permits the lawful arrest or detention of a person in two circumstances. The first is arrest or detention to prevent the person effecting an unauthorised entry into the country. The second is the arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\n32. In a number of cases, the Court has had to consider the meaning of the second limb. In the case of Kolompar, it accepted that the applicant\u2019s detention was in principle justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) where an extradition request had been made and the applicant was no longer detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) or (c) (Kolompar v. Belgium, judgment of 24 September 1992, Series A no. 235\u2011C, \u00a7 36). The Court did not consider whether the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary in order to ensure that he could be extradited, or whether a less intrusive measure would have achieved the same aim.\n33. In the above-mentioned case of Chahal, the Court expressly determined (at \u00a7 112) the question whether the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) contained a \u201cnecessity\u201d test:\n\u201c... it is not in dispute that Mr Chahal has been detained with a \u2018view to deportation\u2019 within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (...). Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not demand that ", "001-57886": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF WYNNE v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 February and 22 June 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge. Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside (see, in this connection, the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n#### B. Release on licence and revocation of a licence\n13. Under section 61 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State may release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment only if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.\n14. Under section 62 (7) of the 1967 Act, if a person subject to a licence is convicted on indictment of an offence, the trial court may, whether or not it passes any other sentence on him, revoke the licence.\n15. The effect of revocation of a licence, whether by the Secretary of State or by a court, is that the person is liable to be detained in pursuance of his sentence (section 62 (9) of the 1967 Act).\n16. It is the duty of the Parole Board to advise the Secretary of State with respect to, inter alia, the release on licence under section 61, and the recall under section 62, of persons whose cases have been referred to the Board by the Secretary of State (section 59 of the 1967 Act; see also the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 21-22, paras. 57-58).\n#### C. Procedures for review of life sentences\n17. Prior to 1992, in respect of both mandatory and discretionary life sentences, the Secretary of State would receive the views of the judiciary (the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice) on the period deemed necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence (\u201cthe tariff period\u201c) and of the Parole Board on the question of risk. The Secretary of State would decide when, if at all, it was appropriate to release the prisoner on life licence.\nHe accepted the views of the judiciary, in discretionary life sentence cases, as to the length of the tariff period. However, in mandatory life sentence cases he formed his own judgment on that question, taking into account the views of the judiciary (for the distinction between discretionary and mandatory life sentences, see the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n18. Following the judgment of the European Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (loc. cit.) changes to the procedures for the release of discretionary life prisoners were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201c). Parliament decided, however, not to extend these changes to mandatory life sentences. Under section 34 of this Act discretionary life prisoners are now informed by the trial judge, in open court, of the tariff period appropriate for the offence. After the expiry of that period, the prisoner has a right to be released on life licence if and when the Parole Board decides that it is safe to do so. They are entitled to appear before the Board in person, to see all the reports placed before it, and to call witnesses and submit documentary evidence. When the Board decides that a prisoner should be released the Secretary of State is under a duty to do so (section 34 (3) of the 1991 Act).\nSection 34 (7) (a) of the 1991 Act specifically excludes from eligibility for review under the new procedures a discretionary life prisoner who is also serving a mandatory life sentence.\n19. In the debate in the House of Commons on 16 July 1991 concerning this legislation, the Minister of State for the Home Department made the following statement concerning the differences between mandatory and discretionary life sentences:\n\u201cMandatory life sentence cases ... raise quite different issues and the Government do not agree that it is appropriate to extend a similar procedure to these cases. In a discretionary case, the decision on release is based purely on whether the offender continues to be a risk to the public. The presumption is that once the period that is appropriate to punishment has passed, the prisoner should be released if it is safe to do so.\nThe nature of the mandatory sentence is different. The element of risk is not the decisive factor in handing down a life sentence. According to the judicial process, the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the State for the rest of his days. If necessary, he can be detained for life without the n", "001-57867": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF FREDIN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n11. The 1988 Act was introduced as a result of the European Court\u2019s findings in several cases, notably against Sweden, that lack of judicial review of certain administrative decisions infringed Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (see, for instance, the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 29-31, paras. 78-87; the Pudas v. Sweden and the Bod\u00e9n v. Sweden judgments of 27 October 1987, respectively Series A no. 125-A, pp. 13-17, paras. 28-42, and Series A no. 125-B, pp. 39-42, paras. 26-37). It was enacted as a temporary law to remain in force until 1991; its validity was subsequently extended to the end of 1994.\n12. Pursuant to section 1 of this Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or another public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only judicial instance, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-\u00e0-vis a private individual. The kind of administrative decision covered by the Act is further defined in Chapter 8, sections 2 and 3 of the Instrument of Government, to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decisions which fall outside its scope, none of which is relevant in the instant case.\nIn proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, the Supreme Administrative Court examines whether the contested decision \u201cconflicts with any legal rule\u201c (section 1 of the 1988 Act). According to the preparatory work to the Act, as reproduced in Government Bill 1987/88:69 (pp. 23-24), its review of the merits of cases concerns essentially questions of law but may, in so far as is relevant for the application of the law, extend also to factual issues; it must also consider whether there are any procedural errors which may have affected the outcome of the case.\n13. If the Supreme Administrative Court finds that the impugned decision is unlawful, it must quash it and, where necessary, refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority (section 5 of the 1988 Act, as applicable at the relevant time).\n14.

The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 which regulated court-martial procedures at the relevant time are set out in the above-cited Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n17. Following the Commission's report in the Findlay case (Findlay v. the United Kingdom, no. 22107/93, Commission's report of 5 September 1995), it was decided that, as and from 1 January 1996, all courts-martial would be composed of presidents and members not in the chain of command of the convening officer. Thereafter, the 1955 Act was amended substantially by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) which came into force on 1 April 1997. The new court-martial system for which the 1996 Act provides is summarised in the Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 52-57) and is outlined in more detail in the case of Cooper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 48843/99, \u00a7\u00a7 15-76, ECHR 2003-XII).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicants complained that they had not been afforded a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law: they considered their courts-martial to lack structural independence and objective impartiality and they relied on the above-cited Findlay judgment. The Government disagreed.\n19. Article 6 \u00a7 1, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. Other than arguing that the complaint was manifestly ill-founded, the Government did not raise any other objection to its admissibility.\n21. It is not disputed that the final decision in the applicants' proceedings was that of the CMAC of 13 November 1998. Their complaints were introduced on 11 January 1999 and, therefore, within the six-month time-limit set down by Article 34 of the Convention. In addition, the Court is of the view that, given the nature of the charges (serious criminal charges under domestic law) together with the nature and severity of the penalties imposed (serious sentences of imprisonment), their courts-martial determined criminal charges against them within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83 and, more recently, Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], Nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7 69-130, ECHR 2003-X and the above-cited Cooper v. the United Kingdom judgment, \u00a7 80.)\n22. The Court considers that the applicants' case raises a question of law which is sufficiently serious that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits and no other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established. The Court therefore declares the case admissible.\nIn accordance with its decision to apply Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 3 abo", "001-61680": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HIRST v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ...is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\nThis section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which back dated to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n18. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)c).\n19. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000, which permitted remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the Government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, a statement that in introducing the measure in Parliament the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n20. On 22 February 2001, the Secretary of State gave his reasons for maintaining the policy of disenfranchising convicted prisoners:\n\u201cBy committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender\u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence, such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period. There is more than one element to punishment than forcible detention. Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society, amongst which is the right to vote for one\u2019s representative.\u201d\n21. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d)\n22. Relevant provisions of the ICCPR provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\u201d\n23. In the General Comment (No. 25(57)) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40(4) of the ICCPR dated 27 August 1996, the Committtee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.\u201d\n#### B. European Prison Rules (1987, Recommendation R(87)3 Council of Europe)\n\u201c64. Imprisonment is by the deprivation of liberty a punishment in itself.

Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters\n24. This document adopted by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) at its 51st Plenary Session (5-6 July 2002) and submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 6 November 2002 includes the Commission\u2019s guidelines as to the circumstances in which there may be deprivation of the right to vote or to be elected:\n\u201cd. ...\ni. provision may be made for depriving individuals of their right to vote and to be elected, but only subject to the following cumulative conditions;\nii. it must be provided for by law;\niii. the proportionality principle must be observed; conditions for disenfranchising individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them;\niv. The deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence.\nv. Furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law.\u201d\n#### D. Sauv\u00e9 v. the Attorney General of Canada (No. 2)\n25. Following the decision of the Administrative Court in the present case, the Supreme Court of Canada on 31 October 2002 held by five votes to four that section 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act 1985, which denied the right to vote to every person imprisoned in a correctional institution serving a sentence of two years or more, was unconstitutional, i.e., infringing Articles 1 and 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:\n\u201c1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\u201d\n\u201c3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein.\u201d\n26. The majority opinion given by McLachlin C.J. is summarised as follows in the headnote:\n\u201cTo justify the infringement of a Charter right under s. 1, the government must show that the infringement achieves a constitutionally valid purpose or objective, and that the chosen means are reasonable and demonstrably justified. The government\u2019s argument that denying the right to vote to penitentiary inmates requires deference because it is a matter of social and political philosophy is rejected. While deference may be appropriate on a decision involving competing social and political policies, it is not appropriate on a decision to limit fundamental rights. The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the rule of law and cannot be lightly set aside. Limits on it require not deference, but careful examination. The framers of the Charter signalled the special importance of this right not only by its broad, untrammelled language, but by exempting it from legislative override under s. 33\u2019s notwithstanding clause. The argument that the philosophically-based or symbolic nature of the objectives in itself commands deference is also rejected. Parliament cannot use lofty objectives to shield legislation from Charter scrutiny. Here, s. 51 (e) is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\nThe government has failed to identify particular problems that require denying the right to vote, making it hard to conclude that the denial is directed at a pressing and substantial purpose. In the absence of a specific problem, the government asserts two broad objectives for s. 51(e): (1) to enhance civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law; and (2) to provide additional punishment or \u2018enhance the general purposes of the criminal sanction\u2019. Vague and symbolic objectives, however, make the justification analysis difficult. The first objective could be asserted of virtually every criminal law and many non-criminal measures. Concerning the second objective, nothing in the record discloses precisely why Parliament felt that more punishment was required for this particular class of prisoner, or what additional objectives Parliament hoped to achieve by this punishment that were not accomplished by the sentences already imposed. Nevertheless, rather than dismissing the government\u2019s objectives outright, prudence suggests that we proceed to the proportionality inquiry.\nSection 51(e) does not meet the proportionality test. In particular, the government fails to establish a rational connection between s. 51(e)\u2019s denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives. With respect to the first objective of promoting civic responsibility and respect for the law, denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values. The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote. To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility. The government\u2019s novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness, equality, and citizen participation. That not all self-proclaimed democracies adhere to this conclusion says little about what the Canadian vision of democracy embodied in the Charter permits. Moreover, the argument that only those who respect the law should participate in the political process cannot be accepted. Denial of the right to vote on the basis of attributed moral unworthiness is inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lies at the heart of Canadian democracy and the Charter. It also runs counter to the plain words of s. 3 of the Charter, its exclusion from the s. 33 override, and the idea that laws command obedience because they are made by those whose conduct they govern.\nWith respect to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment, the government offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of state punishment. Denying the right to vote does not comply with the requirements for legitimate punishment - namely, that punishment must not be arbitrary and must serve a valid criminal law purpose. Absence of arbitrariness requires that punishment be tailored to the acts and circumstances of the individual offender. Section 51(e) qua punishment bears little relation to the offender\u2019s particular crime. As to a legitimate penal purpose, neither the record nor common sense supports the claim that disenfranchisement deters crime or rehabilitates criminals. By imposing a blanket punishment on all penitentiary inmates regardless of the particular crimes they committed, the harm they caused, or the normative character of their conduct, s. 51(e) does not meet the requ", "001-58086": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ANNE-MARIE ANDERSSON c.

Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court B0, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr B. Walsh,\nMr J. De Meyer,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr A.N. Loizou,\nSir John Freeland,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nand also of Mr H. Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March and 25 June 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. The general principle of freedom of information\n14. Under sections 1 and 2 of chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act (Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen), which is part of the Swedish Constitution, everyone is entitled to access to public documents, subject to exceptions set out in the Secrecy Act (Sekretesslagen, 1980:100).\n#### B. Confidentiality of medical information\n15. One of the exceptions to this general rule relates to confidentiality of information in the field of health and medical care and is set out in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, which provides as follows:\n\u201cSecrecy applies ... in the field of health and medical care to information on the individual's state of health or otherwise concerning his or her private life, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any harm to the individual or persons closely related to him or her ...\u201d\n#### C. The duty to report to the Social Council\n16. Notwithstanding this rule of confidentiality, in certain circumstances health and medical-care authorities are required to submit information to another authority. Thus, chapter 14, section 1, of the Secrecy Act provides the following:\n\u201cSecrecy does not prevent ... the disclosure of information to another authority, if an obligation to disclose the information is laid down in an act of law or a government ordinance.\u201d\n17. Such an obligation follows from section 71 of the Social Services Act 1980 (Socialtj\u00e4nstlagen, 1980:620), subsections 2 and 4 of which read as follows:\n\u201cAuthorities whose activities relate to children and young persons as well as other authorities within health and medical-care and social services are obliged immediately to report to the Social Council if, in the course of their activities, they receive information which may imply that an intervention by the Social Council is necessary for the protection of a minor. This also applies to the employees of such authorities and to physicians, teachers, nurses and midwives who are not so employed.\n...\nAuthorities, employees and practitioners referred to in subsection 2 are obliged to give the Social Council all information which may be of importance to an investigation of a minor's need of protection.\u201d\n18. At the time of the enactment of the Social Services Act, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Health and Welfare (Riksdagens socialutskott) stated that the reporting obligation was not limited to cases where it was clear that the Social Council would have to intervene. In addition, unconfirmed information or information which was difficult to assess should also be reported, if it implied that a child might be in need of support or assistance from the Council. In such cases it would be for the Council to investigate whether there was any factual basis for the information in question and whether there was a need for any particular measure (see the report of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, SoU 1979/80:44, p. 113).\n19. The obligation to report only concerns information which is of relevance to the Social Council's investigation. It does not extend to other information concerning the persons in question (see Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 132). It is for the reporting authority or practitioner to decide which information is covered by the reporting obligation.\n20. Information which is submitted to the Social Council is protected by the rule of confidentiality provided by chapter 7, section 4, of the Secrecy Act:\n\u201cSecrecy applies within the social services to inf", "001-60309": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DEVENNEY v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 February 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. By virtue of Section 17 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act as amended, a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n18. Section 42 of the 1976 Act provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub\u2011section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the issue of the section 42 certificate deprived him of access to the tribunal to which he was entitled. In consequence of this alleged denial of access to a tribunal or court, the applicant claimed a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n20. The Court notes that the 1976 Act guaranteed persons a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to their employment, inter alia, by dismissing them or subjecting them to any other detriment. The Fair Employment Tribunal is empowered to assess individuals\u2019 financial loss if they are so discriminated against and award compensation when appropriate. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s pecuniary rights were affected by being denied access to the Fair Employment Tribunal.\n21. The operation of section 42(1), which states that the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order, does not define the scope of the substantive right in limine but provides a respondent with a defence to a complaint of unlawful discrimination (cf. the Powell and Rayner v th", "001-79071": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF LILJA v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government left it to the Court to decide whether the relevant proceedings had been concluded within a reasonable time.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration in respect of the criminal proceedings began on 21 October 1996 and ended on 19 March 2004. It thus lasted seven years and five months for one level of jurisdiction. The corresponding period concerning the tax proceedings began on 5 December 1997 and ended on 2 October 2003 and thus lasted five years and ten months for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government questioned whether the applicant could be considered a victim in so far as his complaint concerned the tax proceedings. They referred to the fact that the relevant taxes, contributions and surcharges had been levied not on the applicant himself but on his company and that, similarly, the company had been the party to the proceedings.\n22. The Government further submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not sued the Swedish State for damages on account of the length of the proceedings. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen), pronounced on 9 June 2005, where a plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, the applicant could have tried this avenue before complaining to the Court or, in any event, should now do so", "001-60737": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF D\u00d6RY v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Industrial injury insurance\n25. All gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against industrial injuries in accordance with the 1976 Act. Anyone who is put on the sick-list as a result of an industrial injury and who is insured under the 1962 Act is entitled to the same per diem benefit from the ordinary sickness insurance (social insurance) during the first 90 days as if he or she had been sick for a reason other than an industrial injury. When 90 days have passed, the insured person is entitled to a per diem sickness benefit in accordance with the 1976 Act (industrial injury insurance), if his or her ability to carry on with gainful employment is reduced by at least 25% (50% prior to 1 July 1990). After the period of sickness has come to an end and the insured person is no longer on the sick-list, he or she is entitled to a life annuity if the capacity for gainful employment is reduced by at least one fifteenth.\n#### B. Social insurance\n26. All Swedish nationals and other residents in Sweden are insured in accordance with the 1962 Act. Anyone who is registered with the Social Insurance Office and has an annual income of at least 6,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) has the right to a per diem sickness benefit, if his or her sickness reduces the ability to work by at least 25%.\n#### C. Procedure\n27. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 and 1976 Acts may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and, at the relevant time, subject to leave to appeal being granted, to the Supreme Social Insurance Court. The latter court was the final instance in social insurance matters until 1 July 1995, when it was abolished and its tasks taken over by the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten).\n28. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. It also regulated the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances was not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court.\n29. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. ", "001-75894": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ELAHI v.

The applicant complained that the length of her detention both in police custody and on remand exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Government maintained under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the application must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or, alternatively, for failure to comply with the six-month rule. Under the first limb of their objections, the Government pointed out that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending. As regards the second limb of their objections, the Government argued, firstly, that the applicant should have lodged her complaint regarding the length of her detention in police custody within six months following the date on which she was remanded in custody, i.e. on 1 October 1993. Secondly, they suggested that the applicant should have lodged her complaint pertaining to the length of her remand in custody within six months following the date on which the District Court ruled on the applicant's request for release, i.e. on 20 November 2000.\n20. The applicant disputed the Government's arguments.\n21. As regards the complaint concerning the length of the applicant's remand in custody, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government's similar objections regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies in previous cases (see, in particular, Tutar v.

It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned applications. In so far as the Government suggest that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months rule, the Court recalls that if an applicant submits her complaints to the Court while she is still in detention, the case cannot be dismissed as being out of time (see, in particular, Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IX). In the instant case, the applicant was still in detention when she lodged her complaint before this Court. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government's objections under this head.\n22. Moreover, the Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the \u00c7obano\u011flu and Budak judgment v. Turkey, (no. 45977/99, \u00a7\u00a7 29\u201130, 30 January 2007).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n16. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In this regard, the Government maintained that the applicants failed to object to their continued remand in detention pursuant to Article 298 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). They further submitted that the applicants failed to raise the substance of the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts.\n17. The applicants did not specifically deal with the Government's objections under this head.\n18. As regards the first limb of the Government's objection, the Court reiterates that under the terms of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it can only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law. However, only available and adequate remedies must be tried under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among others, Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v. Turkey, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 64, 27 June 2006).\n19. The Court recalls that, in the area of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the burden of proof is on the Government claiming non\u2011exhaustion to indicate to the Court with sufficient clarity the remedy to which the applicants have not had recourse and to satisfy the Court that this remedy was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants' complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan, cited above, \u00a7 65). Furthermore, the Court notes that the application of the rule of exhaustion must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to establish. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Acunbay v. Turkey, nos. 61442/00 and 61445/00, \u00a7 45, 31 May 2005).\n20. In the instant case the Court notes that the trial court examined the applicants' detention on remand at the end of each hearing, either of its own motion or upon the request of the applicants. It therefore had the opportunity to end the applicants' alleged lengthy detention and to avoid or to redress an alleged breach of the Convention (see Acunbay, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Tamer and O", "001-58095": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ROBINS c.

Legal aid is available to litigants in the English courts subject to various requirements as to means and the merits of the case in question. Financial assessments of a litigant\u2019s disposable income and capital are carried out by specialist staff of the Benefits Agency\u2019s Legal Aid Assessment Office. The resources of the litigant\u2019s spouse are treated as belonging to the litigant unless they are living \u201cseparate and apart\u201d (see the Civil Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989 no. 338), Regulations 4 and 7).\n#### B. Assessment of costs against a legally aided litigant\n19. In the English courts, the award of costs generally (in all cases, including those where one or more parties are legally aided) is a matter for the discretion of the court (see the Supreme Court Act 1981, section 51). However, rules of court lay down certain principles which are normally applied in the exercise of this discretion, including the principle that the\nunsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party (see the Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 62, Rule 3, and the County Court Rules, Order 38, Rule 1 (3)", "001-101231": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KURKAEV v.

A description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning asylum procedures may be found in the case of Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey (no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a7 29-44, 22 September 2009).\n#### B. Relevant CPT reports\n14. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2002)8 - Report concerning the CPT's visit to the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters (referred to as \u201cthe holding facility\u201d or \u201cdetention unit\u201d at \u201cIstanbul Police Headquarters\u201d) from 2-14 September 2001 are as follows:\n\u201c63. The holding facility at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was not overcrowded at the time of the visit (35 persons). Further, some limited renovation work (e.g. painting of walls) had been carried out shortly before the visit, and all the detainees had a bed and mattress. In addition, the ventilation system worked satisfactorily and the cell doors were unlocked, thereby enabling detainees to have ready access to the facilities in the corridor (e.g. drink dispenser, telephone, etc.) as well as to the sanitary facilities. However, in the same way as during the 1999 visit, it would appear that this relatively favourable state of affairs was atypical.\nConsultation of the relevant register indicated that the facility frequently accommodated between 100 and 200 persons; the space available is totally inadequate for such numbers. Further, despite denials from staff, it subsequently became clear that, due to pressure of numbers in early July, detained foreign nationals had also been placed in the basement-level holding areas in building B; conditions in those areas are totally unsuitable for periods of detention exceeding a few hours. In addition, the information gathered indicated that the provision of mattresses and blankets was a very recent development.\nIt should also be noted that cells and sanitary facilities were in a poor state of repair and cleanliness. Moreover, detainees were still not offered any form of occupational activities (e.g. reading material, toys for children, etc.), and the CPT was particularly concerned to learn that no progress had been made as regards offering outdoor exercise.\n64. At the end of the visit, the delegation called upon the Turkish authorities to attach a high priority to the implementation of already existing plans to extend the holding facility at the Foreigners' Department at Istanbul Police Headquarters. In their reply of 19 December 2001, the Turkish authorities informed the Committee of progress made in this respect.\u201d\n15. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2006)30 Report concerning CPT's visit from 7 to 14 December 2005 are as follows:\n\u201c35. As already indicated (cf. paragraph 9), the situation observed by the CPT's delegation in the detention unit for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was the subject of an immediate observation under Article 8, paragraph 5, of the Convention. With a capacity \u2013 according to staff \u2013 of 90, the unit was holding more than double that figure (147 men and 43 women) on the day of the delegation's visit. The outrageous overcrowding and general sordidness of the conditions in the facility beggared belief, a state of affairs which is all the more serious in view of the fact that some of the detainees had been held there for more than six months.\nThe CPT first drew the Turkish authorities' attention to the unacceptable nature of the arrangements for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters as long ago as 1997, and has subsequently reemphasised this point, most recently in the report on the September 2001 visit (cf. CPT/Inf (2002) 8, paragraphs 62 to 66). Some minor improvements have been made over the years. However, the facts found during the December 2005 visit have highlighted once again the fundamental inadequacy of the existing detention unit; above all, it is too small.\n36. A solution to this long-standing problem might finally be in sight. By letter of 23 February 2006, the Turkish authorities confirmed that a much larger facility for this category of detainee, offering far better conditions, would be brought into service towards the end of 2006, once extensive renovation work at the site concerned (in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc District) had been completed.\nThe CPT calls upon the Turkish authorities to give a very high priority to the bringing into service of the above-mentioned facility; every attempt should be made to accelerate the completion of the ongoing renovation work.\nAs regards the material conditions and regime activities to be offered in the new facility and the staffing arrangements, the CPT recommends the Turkish authorities to take fully into account the standards set out in paragraph 29 of the 7th General Report on the CPT's activities (CPT/Inf (97)10).\n37.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n15. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n16. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c). No leave to appeal is required.\n17. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n18. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n19. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### B. Representation of appellants by counsel\n20. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### C. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n21. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n22. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n23. To extend the legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n24.

This judgment is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form.\nIn the case of FOXLEY v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr W. Fuhrmann,\nMr L. Loucaides,\nMr P. K\u016bris,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nSir Nicolas Bratza, Judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 October 1999 and 30 May 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nInterception of correspondence\n24. Section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Where a bankruptcy order has been made, the court may from time to time, on the application of the official receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, order the Post Office to re-direct and send or deliver to the official receiver or trustee or otherwise any postal packet (within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1953) which would otherwise be sent or delivered by them to the bankrupt at such place or places as may be specified in the order.\n2. An order under this section has effect for such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified in the order.\u201d\n25. Trustees in Bankruptcy have other statutory powers, which are more stringent than the power to apply for a re-direction order but which may nonetheless need to be used, in appropriate cases, if Trustees are properly to investigate the bankrupt\u2019s affairs for the ultimate benefit of his creditors. In particular, under section 365 of the Insolvency Act 1986 a Trustee may obtain a warrant authorising him to seize property, books and/or records falling into the debtor\u2019s estate. Furthermore, section 366 of the Act allows the court (on application by a Trustee) to summon a variety of persons before it to give an affidavit and/or produce documents.\n26. A bankrupt owes a statutory duty, pursuant to section 333 of the Insolvency Act 1986, to give to the Trustee such information as to his affairs, attend meetings with the Trustee and do such other things as the Trustee may reasonably require for the carrying out of his relevant functions.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of article 8 of the convention\n27. The applicant complained that his correspondence, including correspondence with his legal advisers, was intercepted over the period 27 September 1996 to 18 January 1997 by the Post Office on behalf of the Trustee in Bankruptcy. The applicant invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n28. The applicant further contended that the failure of the relevant legislation and the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 to protect his correspondence with the European Commission on Human Rights and with the lawyers advising him on his application to that institution must also be considered an inference with the exercise of his right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention.\n##### 1. Whether there was an interference\n29. The Government did not dispute that there was an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. However, in their submission the impugned interference found its justification in application of the provisions of paragraph 2 of that Article.\n30. The Court observes that the following letters were among the correspondence re-directed to the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy before the expiry of the Order of 27 September 1996 (see paragraph 19 above): two letters from the Legal Aid Board, two letters from the Legal Department of the applicant\u2019s representative organisation, a letter from the Police Complaints Authority and a letter from the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence Police. Each of these letters was copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant. Furthermore, there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 when the Order had expired. One delivery was received on 30 December 1996, the other on 10 January 1997. A number of items in these deliveries were read and copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).\nFor the Court, the measures applied to the applicant\u2019s correspondence were an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d, within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2, with the exercise of the right guaranteed to the applicant under paragraph 1 of the provision. Indeed, the Government have not sought to argue to the contrary.\n##### 2. Justification for the interference\n31. Such interference breaches Article 8 unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and is, in addition, \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve those aims.\n(a) Whether the interference was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d\n32. The applicant contended that the Insolvency Act 1986 (\u201cthe 1986 Act\u201d) did not define with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of the exercise of discretion to re-direct and intercept mail. He observed in this connection that neither the 1986 Act nor the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 made any provision for dealing with legally privileged materials. The applicant further stressed that his correspondence continued to be re-directed after the date of expiry ", "001-81110": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF HASAN ERKAN v.

Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that, although he was a minor at the time, he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n13. The Government maintained in the first place that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since at no stage of the domestic proceedings did he rely on the fact that he had been deprived of his right to legal assistance during police custody. In the alternative, they stated that the application was introduced outside the six months time-limit, since the applicant was represented by a lawyer during his trial after 3 September 2001. In the alternative, relying on the Court\u2019s case-law in the Okul v. Turkey decision (no. 45358/99, 4 September 2003), they considered that the six months time-limit should run from 8 July 2002, the date on which the Court of Cassation delivered its decision.\n14. The Court notes that the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, this restriction was applied as a blanket rule and the applicant could not request the benefit of legal assistance during his police custody. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant failed to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, reg", "001-68506": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KILIN\u00c7 v.

The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1.

A description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Da\u015f v. Turkey (no. 74411/01, \u00a7 18, 8 November 2005).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty as there had been no reasonable suspicion for his arrest. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so...\u201d\n16. The Government did not comment on this complaint.\n17. The Court reiterates that having a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned might have committed the offence (Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, \u00a7 32). However, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at a later stage of the process of criminal investigation (Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27 \u00a7 55).\n18. The Court observes that the applicant was arrested during the course of a police operation carried out against the PKK. According to the arrest protocol, which was signed by the applicant, a search warrant had been issued against him and the applicant had attempted to escape when the police officers asked him to show his identity card.\n19. The Court considers that the aforementioned elements are sufficient to support the conclusion that there was \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the applicant\u2019s arrest. The fact that the proceedings against him were subsequently suspended does not of itself call into question the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).\n20. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006 and 16 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Freedom of association\n16. Freedom of association is guaranteed in the Swedish constitution. Chapter 2, section 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is guaranteed:\n1. freedom of expression: the freedom to communicate information and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations or in any other way; ...\n5. freedom of association: the freedom to unite with others for public or private purposes; ...\u201d\nChapter 2, section 2 protects, inter alia, the negative aspect of freedom of association. It reads:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is protected against coercion to divulge an opinion in a political, religious, cultural or other such connection. In relation to the public administration, he is furthermore protected against coercion to participate in a meeting for the formation of opinion or in a demonstration or other manifestation of opinion, or to belong to a political association, religious congregation or other association for opinions referred to in the first sentence.\u201d\n17. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work (Lag om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet, SFS 1976:580, hereinafter \u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) guarantees the right of employers and employees to form, belong to and work for labour market organisations. The right of association is further protected by section 8, which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it.\n#### B. The relationship between employers and employees\n18. Section 10 of the 1976 Act gives employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees. It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees, who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions.\n19. Under section 26 of the 1976 Act, a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s organisations but also on their members, i.e. companies and individual workers. Moreover, in practice, the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect. This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise.\n20. Under section 27 of the 1976 Act, an employer and an employee cannot conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound. This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void. While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers. Consequently, while the contracts in question remain valid, the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union.\n#### C. The monitoring system\n21. Monitoring of wages for hourly work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch. It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union\u2019s representatives to the employer. If a mistake is discovered, clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter. In some cases, formal negotiations are required.\n22. Under the terms of the Construction Agreement, the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work. The fee \u2013 1.5% of the employee\u2019s wages \u2013 is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual worker.\n23. According to the applicants, a member of the Union pays about 3,500 Swedish kronor (SEK)0 per year in monitoring fees in addition to the union membership fee of SEK 3,000. The largest competing trade union, the Syndicalist union, does not have a monitoring system. The Union therefore has a de facto monopoly in this field.\n24. The regulation regarding the monitoring of wages was incorporated in the 1976 Construction Agreement. Previously, workers paid time-based wages had not been subjected to deductions for monitoring fees. According to the applicants, the purpose was that workers paid time-based wages, as an act of solidarity with workers carrying out piecework, should contribute to the whole inspection system. At the material time, the majority of the workers performed piecework, the measurement of which was costly and time-consuming. The fee for monitoring time-based wages was thus not primarily introduced as reimbursement for the service in question, but as a means of supporting the measurement of piecework wages.\n25. Today, approximately 80% of workers are paid time-based wages, which is almost the opposite ratio compared to the situation in 1976. In general, the monitoring of wages is now computerised and based on information provided by the employer.\n26. According to a statement of 24 May 2006 by Mr Lars-G\u00f6ran Bromander, former division manager at Byggettan, a review of the still existing audit material for 1999 showed that, as a result of the monitoring work, wages had been adjusted upwards for 648 workers, of which 250 were not Union members.\n27. The activities of Byggettan, the local union branch, are divided into two parts: branch activities (inter alia, wage negotiations, union agitation and political work) and business activities (i.e. the inspection work, comprised of the monitoring of time-based wages and the measurement of piecework). Branch or non-profit activities are to be paid for by means of union membership fees. Revenue from the business activities, which is subject to value-added tax, should cover the costs of such activities.\n#### D. Figures concerning monitoring and measuring work\n28. The parties have submitted various documents to the Court containing information on the revenue and cost of the activities of the Building Workers\u2019 Union and the Byggettan branch. The following information has been compiled from these documents.\n##### 1. The annual reports of Byggettan\n29. According to the annual report for 1998, Byggettan had 94 permanent employees (54 officials and 40 administrative personnel) on 31 December 1998. Before the Labour Court, the Building Workers\u2019 Union stated that the number of persons involved in inspection work (monitoring and measuring) during the period relevant to the present case, March \u2013 July 1999, was the same as at the end of 1998, and that the 1998 annual report named 21 officials who had been occupied with this activity. However, the annual report only mentions, in addition to the head of the relevant department, 12 officials who were dealing with such work, one of whom had been doing so only until 26 March 1998. It thus appears that, during the relevant period, 12-13 officials were involved in inspection work, i.e. about 22-24% of the total number of officials. Incidentally, the annual report for 1999 indicates that, at the end of 1999, the total workforce of Byggettan remained the same.\n30. Byggettan\u2019s annual reports for 1997-2000 contain statements of accounts where its business activities, i.e. the inspection work, are separated from its branch activities. According to the statement of accounts for 1999, Byggettan\u2019s branch activities showed a loss of SEK 10.3 million, whereas the inspection work recorded a profit of SEK 5 million. The total revenue from the inspection work amounted to SEK 30.9 million, the operational and administrative costs of this sector of activity were SEK 25.2 million and the write-offs of movables came to SEK 0.7 million. Whereas it is shown, in a footnote to the statement of accounts, that, of the revenue from the inspection work, SEK 21.6 million derived from monitoring fees, there is no such differentiation as regards the costs.\nHowever, in another footnote, information is provided on Byggettan\u2019s costs, which are given separately for the branch activities and the inspection work. The total costs for wages and remunerations in 1999 amounted to SEK 25.5 million, of which SEK 12.5 million (i.e. about 49%) were attributed to the inspection work. The total amount of pension payments was SEK 6.9 million, of which SEK 6.346 million (or about 92%) were a burden on the latter activities. The remaining costs, including offices, travels, administration and social contributions, totalled SEK 28 million, of which SEK 12.7 million (about 45%) were attributed to the inspection work.\n31. In submissions by the Building Workers\u2019 Union to the Labour Court and by the Government in the present proceedings, it has been claimed that the result of the inspection work has to be corrected to the extent that a reimbursement was received from the pension fund of the Building Workers\u2019 Union. In the statement of accounts for 1999, a reimbursement of SEK 6.360 million was recorded for the inspection work. As this reimbursement in effect reduced the costs, the amount has to be deducted from the recorded profit of SEK 5 million in order to arrive at the real financial result of the inspection work. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the pension payments should be recorded as a cost, whereas the pension fund reimbursement should not be considered as revenue. Consequently, in 1999, that sector of activity was actually run at a loss of more than SEK 1.3 million.\nThe applicants, however, disagree with the above calculation. They have stated that, throughout the years, the branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union have made contributions to the pension fund, whose accumulated assets are used to honour the Union\u2019s pension commitments towards its retired personnel. Thus, when making pension payments, the Union branches are not the actual payer but are making the payments on behalf of the pension fund, presumably because the fund does not have an administrative division of its own to handle such payments. Accordingly, the applicants claim that, when determining the actual annual result of the inspection work, the pension transactions should only be taken into account to the extent that the fund reimbursements differ from the pension payments. In 1999, the reimbursement received by Byggettan exceeded the pension payments by as little as SEK 14,000. The financial result of that year should thus be reduced by only that amount and the recorded profit of SEK 5 million consequently remains virtually unchanged.\nIn the statements of accounts of the Building Workers Union\u2019s Gothenburg branch for the years 1997-2000, pension fund reimbursements have been recorded as revenue and pension payments as costs. Consequently, only the differences between reimbursements and payments have affected the annual results.\n32. The statements of accounts in the annual reports of Byggettan for 1997, 1998 and 2000 contain figures which give a picture similar to 1999. In 1997, the revenue from the inspection work was SEK 27.9 million (of which the monitoring fees came to SEK 17.3 million) and the recorded profit of that sector of activity amounted to SEK 3.4 million. Byggettan received a pension fund reimbursement of more than SEK 8.3 million. If the result is corrected with this amount, in the manner claimed by the Government, the profit would turn into a loss of SEK 4.9 million. However, the reimbursement exceeded the pens"}
