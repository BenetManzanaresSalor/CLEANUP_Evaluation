RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Impartiality\n39. In a judgment of the House of Lords in Magill v Porter [2001] UKHL 67, Lord Hope of Craighead endorsed a judgment of the Court of Appeal, which took into consideration the jurisprudence of this Court, on the question of apparent bias and concluded that:\n\u201cThe question is whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased.\u201d\n40. In Helow v Secretary of State for the Home Department and Another (Scotland) [2008] UKHL 62, the House of Lords gave further guidance as to the attributes of the \u201cfair-minded and informed observer\u201d. Lord Hope of Craighead explained (at paragraphs 2-3) that:\n\u201cThe observer who is fair-minded is the sort of person who always reserves judgment on every point until she has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument. She is not unduly sensitive or suspicious ... Her approach must not be confused with that of the person who has brought the complaint. The 'real possibility' test ensures that there is this measure of detachment. The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be justified objectively. But she is not complacent either. She knows that fairness requires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. She knows that judges, like anybody else, have their weaknesses. She will not shrink from the conclusion, if it can be justified objectively, that things that they have said or done or associations that they have formed may make it difficult for them to judge the case before them impartially.\nThen there is the attribute that the observer is 'informed'. It makes the point that, before she takes a balanced approach to any information she is given, she will take the trouble to inform herself on all matters that are relevant. She is the sort of person who takes the trouble to read the text of an article as well as the headlines. She is able to put whatever she has read or seen into its overall social, political or geographical context. She is fair-minded, so she will appreciate that the context forms an important part of the material which she must consider before passing judgment.\u201d\n#### B. The presence of an unauthorised person in the jury room\n41. In Goby v Wetherill [1915] 2 KB 674, a civil case, the town sergeant, acting as an usher in the county court, had, through what was described as an excess of zeal, retired into the retiring room with the jury and remained there for about 20 minutes whilst they were considering their verdict. The High Court held that the action vitiated the verdict, which could not stand.\n42. In R v McNeil [1967] Crim LR 540, a criminal case, two uniformed police officers acting as jury bailiffs had retired with the jury and remained there throughout the time when the verdict was being arrived at, apparently in ignorance of the fact that it was something that they ought not to do. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against conviction, holding that the retirement of strangers with the jury during their deliberations was an irregularity which was difficult to cure, even if, as in that case, an assurance had been received from the foreman that the bailiffs had taken no part in the deliberations and had not influenced the members of the jury in their decision.\n#### C. Communication with the jury when retired\n43. In R v Furlong (1950) Cr App R 79, the Court of Appeal upheld a conviction where the clerk of court had been instructed to go to the jury room and ask them to put a question in writing. The court concluded that it was satisfied that the clerk had not, himself, entered the jury room but:\n\u201cEven if he had, we do not think that that would have been in itself an irregularity, because the court always has power to allow somebody to make a communication to the jury, if it is a communication proper to be made, and if it is made by the direction of the court.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Domestic law\n28. The relevant provision of the Spanish Constitution reads as follows:\nArticle 17\n\u201cEveryone has the right to liberty and security. No one may be deprived of his liberty other than in accordance with the provisions of this Article and in the circumstances and form provided by law.\u201d\n29. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the material time stipulated as follows:\nArticle 92\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Articles, convicted persons who have reached the age of 70 or who reach that age while serving their sentence, and who satisfy the requirements laid down [by the law], with the exception of the requirement to have served three quarters or, where appropriate, two thirds of [the sentence], may be granted conditional release.\n...\u201d\nArticle 325\n\u201cAny person who ... causes or produces, directly or indirectly, emissions, discharges ... into ... inland or maritime waters or groundwater ... likely to severely upset the balance of natural systems, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between six months and four years, a day-fine payable for between eight and twenty\u2011four months and a prohibition of between one and three years on carrying out his or her occupation. Where there is a risk to persons\u2019 health the term of imprisonment shall be in the upper half of the range.\u201d\nArticle 326\n\u201cThe commission of any of the acts described in the previous Article shall entail a more severe sentence when accompanied by:\na. illegal operation of an industrial or other activity using facilities which have not obtained the necessary administrative authorisation or approval; or\nb. failure to comply with the express instructions of the administrative authority aimed at remedying or putting an end to the activities referred to in the previous Article; or\nc. falsification or concealment of information on the environmental implications of the activities in question; or\nd. hampering of the administrative authorities\u2019 inspection activities; or\ne. a risk of irreversible or catastrophic damage; or\nf. illegal pumping of water while restrictions are in place.\u201d\nArticle 331\n\u201cThe penalty imposed for an offence referred to in this Chapter shall be in the lower half of the range where the offence was the result of gross negligence.\u201d\n30. The second paragraph of Article 325 of the Criminal Code, as amended in November 2003, provides:\nArticle 325\n\u201c2. Persons who knowingly release, discharge or introduce ionising radiation or other substances into the air, soil or maritime waters ... in quantities such as to cause death or illness ... with irreversible effects, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between two and four years in addition to the penalty for causing personal injury.\u201d\n31. The relevant provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:\nArticle 531\n\u201cIn determining the nature and amount of the security, consideration should be given to the nature of the offence, the social circumstances of the accused and any previous convictions, together with any other circumstance which may increase or reduce the incentive to evade justice.\u201d\n32. The Environmental Liability Act (Law no. 26/2007 of 23 October 2007) regulates operators\u2019 responsibility to prevent and remedy environmental damage in accordance with Article 45 of the Constitution and the precautionary and \u201cpolluter pays\u201d principles.\n#### B. Protection of the marine environment\n33. An increasing tendency has been observed at European level to use the criminal law as a means of enforcing the environmental obligations imposed by European Union law.\n##### 1. Council of Europe instruments\n34. In 1998 the Council of Europe opened for signature the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law (ETS No. 172). To date, however, only thirteen States have signed the Convention and Estonia is the only country to have ratified it. The text includes the following provisions:\nArticle 2 \u2013 Intentional offences\n\u201c1. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law:\na. the discharge, emission or introduction of a quantity of substances or ionising radiation into air, soil or water which:\n(i) causes death or serious injury to any person, or\n(ii) creates a significant risk of causing death or serious injury to any person;\nb. the unlawful discharge, emission or introduction of a quantity of substances or ionising radiation into air, soil or water which causes or is likely to cause their lasting deterioration or death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to protected monuments, other protected objects, property, animals or plants;\nc. the unlawful disposal, treatment, storage, transport, export or import of hazardous waste which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants;\nd. the unlawful operation of a plant in which a dangerous activity is carried out and which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants;\ne. the unlawful manufacture, treatment, storage, use, transport, export or import of nuclear materials or other hazardous radioactive substances which causes or is likely to cause death or serious injury to any person or substantial damage to the quality of air, soil, water, animals or plants,\nwhen committed intentionally.\n2. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law aiding or abetting the commission of any of the offences established in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\u201d\nArticle 3 \u2013 Negligent offences\n\u201c1. Each Party shall adopt such appropriate measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed with negligence, the offences enumerated in Article 2, paragraph 1 a to e.\n2. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, declare that paragraph 1 of this Article, in part or in whole, shall only apply to offences which were committed with gross negligence.\n3. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, declare that paragraph 1 of this Article, in part or in whole, shall not apply to:\n\u2013 sub-paragraph 1.a.ii. of Article 2,\n\u2013 sub-paragraph 1.b. of Article 2, in so far as the offence relates to protected monuments, to other protected objects or to property.\u201d\nArticle 6 \u2013 Sanctions for environmental offences\n\u201cEach Party shall adopt, in accordance with the relevant international instruments, such appropri", "001-100897": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HINCZEWSKI v.

If, no later than on the day of vote, he has attained 18 years of age, a Polish citizen shall have the right to participate in a referendum and the right to vote for the President of the Republic of Poland as well as representatives to the Sejm and Senate and organs of local government.\n2. Persons who, by a final judgment of a court, have been subjected to legal incapacitation or deprived of civic or electoral rights, shall have no right to participate in a referendum or to vote.\u201d\n16. Article 79 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cIn accordance with principles specified by statute, everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed, shall have the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the conformity with the Constitution of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the Constitution.\u201d\n17.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n32. In Austrian law area zoning plans and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees (Verordnungen), even if they only concern one individual's property. Accordingly, the proceedings in which they are issued are not normal administrative proceedings and the persons affected are not parties to them. The lawfulness of decrees can be challenged before the Constitutional Court under Article 139 of the Federal-Constitution Act. However, case-law has established that area zoning plans cannot be directly challenged in proceedings under Article 139 by the individuals affected if it is possible to institute administrative proceedings.\n33. This is the case, in particular, where the area zoning plan is the basis for the granting or withholding of building permits. The persons affected are expected to assert their rights in administrative proceedings concerning the building permit, in which they can allege that the underlying area zoning plan has no legal basis or is contrary to the applicable legislation.\n34. The review of the lawfulness of general legal acts such as decrees issued by administrative authorities as to their lawfulness and of laws (Gesetze) as to their constitutionality is concentrated with the Constitutional Court.

The holding facility at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was not overcrowded at the time of the visit (35 persons). Further, some limited renovation work (e.g. painting of walls) had been carried out shortly before the visit, and all the detainees had a bed and mattress. In addition, the ventilation system worked satisfactorily and the cell doors were unlocked, thereby enabling detainees to have ready access to the facilities in the corridor (e.g. drink dispenser, telephone, etc.) as well as to the sanitary facilities. However, in the same way as during the 1999 visit, it would appear that this relatively favourable state of affairs was atypical.\nConsultation of the relevant register indicated that the facility frequently accommodated between 100 and 200 persons; the space available is totally inadequate for such numbers.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Remedies for the excessive length of proceedings\n68. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the provisions of the 2004 Act as applicable at the material time, are set out in the Court's decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\n#### B. Succession to claims for non-pecuniary damage\n69. Article 445 \u00a7 3 of the Polish Civil Code reads as follows:\n\u201cA claim for non-pecuniary damage can be inherited only when a claim had been acknowledged by the testator, or when a claim had been introduced in the testator's lifetime.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n70. On 30 October 2007 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicants' rights under Articles 6 \u00a7 1 and 13 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the first set of civil proceedings in which the applicants had been involved. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the first applicant PLN 20,000 (the equivalent of approx. EUR 4,400). The Government invited the Court to strike out this part of the application in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n71. The first applicant and the second applicant's heirs did not agree with the Government's proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the case. They maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n72. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government \u2013 even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued.\n73. However, in a letter of 20 July 2009 the Government expressed the opinion that the first applicant could no longer claim to be a victim, as a violation of her rights guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention had been recognised and remedied at the national level. In this respect they referred to the Krak\u00f3w Court of Appeal's judgment (see paragraph 62 above) by which the first applicant was awarded PLN 70,000 in damages.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Constitutional provisions\n16. The Constitution was adopted by the National Assembly on 2 April 1997 and entered into force on 17 October 1997.\nArticle 45 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution reads:\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court.\u201d\nArticle 190 of the Constitution, regarding the effects of judgments of the Constitutional Court, provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final.\n2. Judgments of the Constitutional Court, ... shall be published without delay.\n3. A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from the day of its publication; however, the Constitutional Court may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act. Such a time-limit may not exceed eighteen months in relation to a statute or twelve months in relation to any other normative act. ...\n4. A judgment of the Constitutional Court on non-conformity with the Constitution, an international agreement or statute, of a normative act on the basis of which a final and enforceable judicial decision or a final administrative decision ... is given, shall be a basis for reopening the proceedings or for quashing the decision ... in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings.\u201d\n#### B. The Law on the Organisation of Courts\n17. The Law of 27 July 2001 (as amended) on the Organisation of Courts (Prawo o ustroju s\u0105d\u00f3w powszechnych; hereinafter \u201cthe 2001 Act\u201d) sets out comprehensively all matters related to the organisation and administration of courts of general jurisdiction, the status of judges and their self-governing bodies, and the position of assessors and trainee judges, court employees and officers and lay judges.\nThe 2001 Act stipulates the requirements that have to be fulfilled to assume the office of a district court judge. A candidate for such office is required, among other conditions, to complete a judge's or prosecutor's training (aplikacja) and then pass the relevant examination. Subsequently, he or she has to work a minimum of three years as an assessor in a district court.\nSections 134-136 of the 2001 Act regulate the position of assessors. They provide, in so far as relevant:\nSection 134\n\u201c\u00a7 1. The Minister of Justice may appoint as an assessor a person who has completed a judge's or prosecutor's training and passed the judge's or prosecutor's examination and who meets the requirements specified in section 61 \u00a7 1 (1-4).\n[...]\n\u00a7 5. The Minister of Justice may discharge an assessor having given him notice and subject to approval by the board (of judges) of a regional court.\u201d\nSection 135\n\u201c\u00a7 1. The Minister of Justice may, subject to approval by the board (of judges) of a regional court, authorise an assessor to exercise judicial powers in a district court for a specified period of time, not exceeding four years. [...]\n\u00a7 2. While adjudicating, assessors shall be independent and subject only to the Constitution and statutes.\n[...]\n\u00a7 5. During the period in which an assessor exercises judicial powers he or she remains under the supervision of a judge designated to carry out the function of a consulting judge.\n[...]\u201d\n#### C. Decision of the Constitutional Court of 30 0ctober 2006, case no. S 3/06 (so-called \u201csignal decision\u201d)\n18. In this decision, following the filing of two constitutional complaints challenging the constitutionality of the status of assessors, the Constitutional Court decided to draw the attention of the Sejm (the lower Chamber of the Parliament) to the need to consider a bill on the system of appointing persons who exercise judicial powers. It noted that both the National Judicial Council and the Ombudsman had shared the main arguments of the claimants as to the unconstitutionality. The Constitutional Court noted that the possible finding of unconstitutionality in respect of the provisions governing the status of assessors could have far-reaching consequences for the whole system of the administration of justice, having regard to the number of assessors adjudicating in the district courts.\n#### D. Judgment of the Constitutional Court of 24 October 2007, case no. SK 7/06\n19. The proceedings before the Constitutional Court were initiated by two constitutional complaints. The first of them was made by J.W., who complained that his detention had been imposed by an assessor. The second complaint was lodged by a company, AD Dr\u0105gowski S.A., which complained that a prosecutor's decision discontinuing a criminal investigation had been reviewed by an assessor. Both complainants alleged that various provisions of the 2001 Act which govern the position of assessors were incompatible, inter alia, with Article 45 of the Constitution, providing for the right to have one's case examined by an impartial and independent court.\n20. The Constitutional Court heard the case as a full court (fourteen judges). In the first part of the operative part it held that:\n\u201cSection 135 \u00a7 1 of the Law of 27 July 2001 on the Organisation of Courts was incompatible with Article 45 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d\nIt found that the vesting of judicial powers in assess", "001-102115": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF ANDERSSON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Work Injury Insurance Act\n28. According to Chapter 2, section 1, of the 1976 Work Injury Insurance Act, the term \u201cwork injury\u201d mainly refers to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful factors at a person\u2019s place of work. Under the Act, all gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against work injuries. The insurance scheme is administered by the social insurance offices (as from 2005 the Swedish Social Insurance Agency) and includes, among other things, compensation for loss of earnings. A work injury must be immediately reported to the employer who is required to notify the social insurance office. The office must obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury. A medical doctor is attached to the office to assist it in medical matters. The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as a work injury, as well as the degree of reduction of a person\u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment, shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions, the medical doctor\u2019s assessment of these opinions and any other relevant information.\n29. For an injury to qualify as a work injury, a causal link must be established between the accident or harmful effect in the workplace and the insured person\u2019s health problems. What is meant by \u201charmful effect\u201d is the influence of a factor that is very likely to cause an injury or illness such as that incurred by the insured person (Chapter 2, section 1, of the 1976 Act in its wording from 1 January 1993 until 30 June 2002). At the relevant time, the question of whether a particular injury or illness incurred by the insured person was to be regarded as a work injury was subject to the following special rule of evidence. If the insured person had suffered an accident or had been subjected to some other harmful effect at work, his or her medical problems were presumed to have been caused by the accident or the harmful effect if there were substantial grounds in support of such a conclusion (Chapter 2, section 2, of the 1976 Act in its wording from 1 January 1993 and until 30 June 2002).\n30.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Section 4(2) orders\n13. Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that where legal proceedings are held in public, in any such proceedings the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.\n14. Section 159 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that in England and Wales, where such an order is made, an aggrieved person may appeal such an order to the Court of Appeal. The section does not apply to Scotland. Instead, following the High Court of Justiciary's ruling in Galbraith v. H.M. Advocate 2001 S.L.T. 465, where the question was considered obiter dicta, it appears that the practice of Scottish courts will be to make interim orders for forty-eight hours, to give notice of the interim order to the legal representatives of media organisations and give them the opportunity to address the court on the terms of the interim order. A full copy of any section 4(2) order is intimated to press and media contacts who are listed with the Scottish Courts Service. The names of cases where section 4(2) orders are in place are available from the Scottish Courts Service website.\n#### B. The nobile officium\n15. The concept of nobile officium in Scots law is an extraordinary equitable power vested in, inter alia, the High Court of Justiciary. It was described by the High Court in Anderson v. HMA 1974 SLT 239 as:\n\u201c...a remedy for any extraordinary or unforeseen occurrence in the course of criminal business in any part of the country...In short, the principle is, that wherever the interposition of some authority is necessary to the administration of justice, and there exists no other judicature by whom it can competently be exercised, or which has been in use to exercise it, the Court of Justiciary is empowered and bound to exercise its powers [of nobile officium], on the application of the proper part", "001-102371": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DO\u011eAN AND KALIN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Criminal trials in Northern Ireland\n28. In Northern Ireland, under section 75 of the Terrorism Act 2000, trials on indictment can be conducted by so-called \u201cDiplock courts\u201d (courts without a jury) if the indictment is for a \u201cscheduled offence\u201d (one of the offences listed in Schedule 9 to the same Act). The trial then takes place before a judge sitting alone who hears all the evidence and reaches a verdict. He or she is also responsible for conducting the trial and pronouncing sentence if the defendant is found guilty. The judge must give a reasoned verdict if he convicting the defendant.\n#### B. Disclosure\n29. Disclosure in criminal cases is regulated by Part 1 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) and the Crown Court (Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996) (Disclosure) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Rules\u201d).\nSection 3 of the 1996 Act regulates primary disclosure by the prosecution. Section 3(1)(a) provides that the prosecution must disclose to the defence any material which, in the opinion of the prosecutor, might undermine the prosecution case against the accused. Primary disclosure is followed, where appropriate, by the accused providing a defence statement under section 5(5). This triggers secondary disclosure by the prosecution under section 7(2)(a) which provides that the prosecutor must disclose to the accused any prosecution material which has not previously been disclosed to the accused and which might be reasonably expected to assist the accused's defence as disclosed by the defence statement.\nSection 8 of the 1996 Act allows the accused to apply to the court for an order that the prosecutor provide undisclosed material. Section 9(2) requires the prosecutor to keep under review whether disclosure is required.\nSections 3(6), 7(5), 8(5) and 9(8) of the 1996 Act provide that material must not be disclosed under the foregoing provisions to the extent that the court, on an application by the prosecutor, concludes it is not in the public interest to disclose it.\nSection 14A (covering procedures for trial on indictment for scheduled offences) provides that the accused may apply to the court to review its decision to order non-disclosure on grounds of public interest. Under section 15 (which applies to trials conducted before a judge and jury) where a court has made a non-disclosure order it must keep under review the question whether it is still not in the public interest to disclose material affected by its order. It must do so without the need for an application but the accused may apply to the court for a review of that question.\n30. Rule 2 of the 1997 Rules regulates an application made under section 3(6), 7(5), 8(5) or 9(8) of the 1996 Act. There are three types of application under Rule 2:\n(a) An application by the prosecutor to the judge, to be determined at an inter partes hearing. The accused receives notice of the application and details of the nature of the material to which the application relates.\n(b) An ex parte application by the prosecutor to the judge, of which notice is given to the accused. The accused does not receive information on the nature of the material to which the application relates.\n(c) An ex parte application by the pro", "001-102787": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF SCHUMMER v.

JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS\n44. Given that the present two applications concern two sets of proceedings in both of which a similar subject-matter, namely the applicant's continued preventive detention, was at issue, the Court decides that the applications shall be joined (Rule 42 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n45. The applicant complained in his application no. 42225/07 that his continued preventive detention beyond the period of ten years which had been the maximum for such detention under the legal provisions applicable at the time of his offence and conviction breached Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court; ...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\n(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants; ...\u201d\n46. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n47. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties' submissions\n48. The applicant argued that the retrospective prolongation of his preventive detention from an initial maximum period of ten years to an unlimited period of time, eighteen months before his scheduled release from preventive detention, had rendered his detention arbitrary and failed to comply with Article 5.\n49. The Government took the view that in terms of the temporal course of events, the present applications were parallel cases to the application of M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04. At the time of the applicant's conviction in 1985, a first order of preventive detention was limited by law to a maximum duration of ten years. Following the abolition of the ten-year maximum period in 1998, the applicant kept being placed in preventive detention also after 26 June 1999, when he had served ten years in his first preventive detention.

The statutory provisions on custody and contact are to be found in the German Civil Code (B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch).\n57. Article 1626 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code provides that the father and the mother have the right and the duty to exercise parental authority (elterliche Sorge) over a minor child. Parental authority includes the custody of the child.\n58. Article 1671 of the Civil Code stipulates that where parents exercising joint parental authority are separated not merely temporarily, each parent may make an application to the family court to be awarded sole parental authority or shared parental authority. The application shall be allowed where the other parent agrees, unless the child has reached the age of fourteen and objects to such sharing or if it may be expected that the withdrawal of joint parental authority and its transfer to the petitioner is in the best interests of the child.\n#### B. The Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings\n59. At the time of the decisions of the domestic courts, proceedings in family matters were governed by the Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings.\n60. According to section 12 of that Act, the court shall, of its own motion, take the measures of investigation that are necessary to establish the relevant facts and take such evidence as appears appropriate.\n61. Section 50 b \u00a7 1 of the Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings stipulates that in proceedings regarding custody issues a child shall be heard if its affinities, attachments or its wishes are of relevance for the court's decision or if the determination of the facts requires the court to hear the child.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. The applicant complained about the lack of a proper hearing before the District Court. Furthermore he alleges that the District Court failed to duly hear him in person. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention which, in so far as material, reads as follows.\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n41. The applicant maintained that the Mattighofen District Court had failed to hold a proper hearing in his case. In his view that court should have held a hearing once it had obtained the expert opinion of Dr. B. He emphasised that in custody proceedings the parents of the child must be heard in person and asserted that he had not been given a proper opportunity to make oral submissions.\n42. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s allegation that the courts had failed to hold a proper hearing and to hear him in person was unsupported by the facts of the case. The District Court had held two hearings, namely, on 12 March and 8 July 2002, in which the factual and legal issues of the case were discussed. These hearings gave the applicant an opportunity to make submissions and allowed the court to obtain a personal impression of both parties. Moreover, the applicant made repeated use of the opportunity to file written submissions. Finally, he was given a time-limit to comment on the decisive expert opinion of Dr B. However, he did not make use of this opportunity but limited his submissions to an application for a further hearing. In sum, the proceedings complied with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles\n43. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the right to a public hearing under Article 6 entails an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for instance, Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria, 23 April 1997, \u00a7 51, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011II, and Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, \u00a7 46, Reports 1998\u2011I).\n44. Furthermore, the right to appear in person in a civil case is not, as such guaranteed by the Convention but may, in particular circumstances, be implied in the right to a fair hearing, in particular where the court needs to gain a personal impression of the parties (see, mutatis mutandis, Helmers v.

The applicant complained under Article 2 of the Convention that the gendarmes had acted in complete disregard of the right to life by using explosives and firearms and that it was only by pure chance that he had survived. Under Article 3 of the Convention the applicant further complained that, having been shot at, beaten up and exposed to tear gas, he had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment. Relying on Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention, the applicant submitted that his allegations had not been investigated in an effective manner at the national level.\n40. The Government contested those arguments.\n41. The Court notes at the outset that the Government did not challenge the applicability of Article 2 of the Convention. In any event, the Court considers that the applicant's fortuitous survival does not prevent the Court from examining the complaint under Article 2 of the Convention, since the use of the firearm in a prison setting was potentially fatal and put his life at risk (see, mutatis mutandis, Makaratzis v.

They submitted that there were no documents in the file to show that the Assize Court\u2019s decision had been served on the applicants on 9 February 2005.\n23. The Government also considered that the applicants had failed to make use of a number of civil and administrative remedies in respect of their complaints of ill-treatment.\n24. The Government lastly argued that, according to the medical reports, the second applicant had not been ill-treated. Thus, his allegations of ill-treatment were devoid of any basis.\n25. The three applicants maintained that the decision had been communicated to them on 9 February 2005, and argued that it was up to the Government to provide documentary evidence to the contrary. They also maintained that they had exhausted all domestic remedies.\n26. The second applicant argued that the absence of any mention of injuries in the medical report did not mean that he had not been ill-treated. To that end he argued that ill-treatment did not always result in physical injuries, but sometimes only in psychological problems. After having been ill-treated by the police he had not been examined by a psychologist or a psychiatrist because the hospital to which he had been taken by the police after his arrest did not provide such examinations.\n27.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n24. Article 63 of the Constitution read as follows:\nThe courts have authority to adjudge on any matter concerning the limits to the competence of a public authority. However, anyone wishing to raise such matters cannot avoid temporarily complying with orders issued by the public authorities by bringing them before the courts.\n25. Applications for asylum are determined in the first instance by the Immigration Service and in the second instance by the Refugee Appeals Board under the Aliens Act (Udl\u00e6ndingeloven), the relevant provisions of which at the relevant time read as follows\nSection 7\n1. Upon application, a residence permit will be issued to an alien if the alien falls within the provisions of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (28 July 1951).\n2. Upon application, a residence permit will be issued to an alien if the alien risks the death penalty or being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in case of return to his country of origin. An application as referred to in the first sentence hereof is also considered an application for a residence permit under subsection 1.\n3. A residence permit under subsections 1 and 2 can be refused if the alien has already obtained protection in another country, or if the alien has close ties with another country where the alien must be deemed to be able to obtain protection.\nSection 8\n1. Upon application, a residence permit will be issued to an alien who arrives in Denmark under an agreement made with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or similar international agreement, and who falls within the provisions of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (28 July 1951), see section 7(1).\n2. In addition to the cases mentioned in subsection 1, a residence permit will be issued, upon application, to an alien who arrives in Denmark under an agreement as mentioned in subsection 1, and who risks the death penalty or being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in case of return to his country of origin, see section 7 subsection 2.\n3. In addition to the cases mentioned in subsections 1 and 2, a residence permit will be issued, upon application, to an alien who arrives in Denmark under an agreement as mentioned in subsection 1, and who would presumably have satisfied the fundamental conditions for obtaining a residence permit under one of the provisions of the Aliens Act if he had entered Denmark as an asylum-seeker.\n4. In the selection of aliens issued with a residence permit under subsections 1 to 3, the aliens\u2019 possibilities of establishing roots in Denmark and benefiting from the residence permit, including their language qualifications, education and training, work experience, family situation, network, age and motivation, must be emphasised unless particular reasons make it inappropriate.\n5. Unless particular reasons make it inappropriate, it must be made a condition for a residence permit under subsections 1 to 3 that the alien assists in a special health examination and consents to the health information being transmitted to the Danish Immigration Service and the local council of the municipality to which the alien is allocated, and signs a declaration concerning the conditions for resettlement in Denmark.\n6. The Minister of Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs decides the overall distribution of the aliens to be issued with a residence permit under subsections 1 to 3.\n26.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Administrative Court against judgments of the Regional Administrative Courts are stated in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Subicka v. Poland, no. 29342/06, \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201121, 14 September 2010.\n28. In particular, in its decision no. II FZ 651/07 of 18 January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the time-limit by a legally-aided applicant could be admitted for examination.\n29. When legal aid has been granted and the time-limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired, it is open to the legally-aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time made under sections 86 and 87 of the Law on the Procedure before Administrative Courts (e.g. NSA FZ 754/04 of 31 January 2005 and NSA, I OZ 160/08 of 14 March 2008). In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within seven days from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party, which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist (e.g. the Bia\u0142ystok Regional Administrative Court, II SAB Bk 27/07 of 10 April 2008), or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file (e.g. the Pozna\u0144 Regional Administrative Court, IV SA/Po 865/06 of 13 November 2007).\n30. In a number of its recent decisions the Supreme Administrative Court acknowledged the difficulties which legally-aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first-instance administrative courts. It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough. It analysed relevant case-law of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which the beginning of the time-limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 June 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At the material time, following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, an applicant had a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cthe AIT\u201d). Section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as inserted by section 81(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004) provided that a party to an appeal to the AIT could apply for an order that the AIT reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law.\n28. Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted, an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) stated that:\n\u201cWhen a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\n29. Where a person was not granted leave to enter the United Kingdom, he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State also had power to deport any person who was not a British citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d.\n### III. RELEVANT EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n30. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (\u201cthe Qualification Directive\u201d) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n31. On 17 October 2007 the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) asking, inter alia, whether article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.\n32. The ECJ held that article 15(c) protection went beyond that of Article 3 of the Convention, which was covered by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive. The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows:\n\u201cArticle 15(c) of the Directive, in conjunction with article 2(e) of the Directive, must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country or as the case may be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.\u201d\n33. In QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 620 the Court of Appeal observed that the ECJ in Elgafaji had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality, but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article 15(c). A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article 15(c) where the level of violence was such that, without anything to render them a particular target, civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety.\n34. More recently, in the case of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat, whether permissible under the laws or not, that seriously endangered non-combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive.\n### IV. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n35. It is a well-established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country. This principle is reflected both in article 8 of the Qualification Directive and paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay.\n36. In the cases of Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords held that the decision-maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so. In this regard, the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality, including in his former place of habitual residence. If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation, judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally, and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there. However, the more closely the persecution was linked to the State, and the greater the control of the State over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf, the more likely (other things being equal) that a victim of persecution in one place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same State.\n### V. RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMALIA\n#### A. Factual background\n37. The factual background to the conflict in Somalia, as described in the country reports at paragraphs 80 \u2013 188 below and subsequently agreed by the parties, is as follows.\n38. Somalia is comprised of three autonomous areas: the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the north west, the state of Puntland in the north east, and the remaining southern and central regions. Somali society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families, which are subdivided into clans and sub-clans. The four majority clans are Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq and Dir. In addition there are a number of minority groups, which are also divided into sub-groups. The Digli and Mirifle take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups.\n39. Somalia has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President Siad Barre by opposing clans in 1991. The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness, civil conflict and clan warfare followed. Mogadishu was fragmented into rival, clan-based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords. The Transitional Federal Government was established in October 2004 but a combination of internal divisions within the Transitional Federal Government and insecurity in central and southern Somalia hindered it from becoming a functioning Government. In June 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts, a union of various Sharia courts, took control of Mogadishu. Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of most of central and southern Somalia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 (2006) authorised the deployment of an African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development force to protect the Transitional Federal Government. Ethiopian ground and air forces also moved into Somalia to support the Transitional Federal Government and by late December 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts had been ousted from Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. Remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops.\n40. After the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts, the semblance of order and security that it had created in Mogadishu deteriorated. Roadblocks and checkpoints returned, as did banditry and violence. Furthermore, attacks by anti-government elements on Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces continued in Mogadishu, with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting. Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced. The fall of the Union of Islamic Courts also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra-clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued.\n41. In 2007 the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia was created when Somali Islamists and opposition leaders joined forces to fight the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces.\n42. On 20 August 2008 the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia signed a ceasefire agreement in Djibouti. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, the Islamic insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement, and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia.\n43. By late 2008 Islamist insurgents, including a group called al\u2011Shabaab, had regained control of most of southern Somalia.\n44. Somalia\u2019s Parliament met in Djibouti in January 2009 and swore in 149 new members from the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. The Parliament also extended the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government for another two years and installed moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as the new President.\n45. Ethiopia pulled its troops out of Somalia in January 2009. Soon after, al-Shabaab took control of Baidoa, formerly a key stronghold of the Transitional Federal Government. In May 2009 Islamist insurgents launched an attack on Mogadishu, prompting President Ahmad to appeal for help from abroad.\n46. In October 2009 al-Shabaab consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival, Hizbul Islam, out of the southern port city of Kismayo. Since then it has openly declared its alliance with al-Qaeda and has been steadily moving forces up towards Mogadishu.\n47. In December 2010 Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab merged.\n#### B. Parties to the conflict\n##### 1. The Transitional Federal Government\n48. The Transitional Federal Government is recognised by the United Nations and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of Somalia. However, it currently controls only a small section of Mogadishu centred on the port, the airport and the presidential palace. It is largely dependent on African Union troops for its survival.\n##### 2. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\n49. AMISOM is an African Union force authorised by the UN Security Council and deployed to Mogadishu to support the Transitional Federal Government. It currently consists of 5,300 Ugandan and Burundian troops.\n##### 3. Ethiopian forces\n50. Ethiopian forces joined the conflict in 2006 to help drive out the Union of Islamic Courts. They remained in Somalia until their withdrawal at the beginning of 2009.\n##### 4. Al-Shabaab\n51. Al-Shabaab began as part of the armed wing of the Union of Islamic Courts. When the 2006 Ethiopian military intervention sent the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts into exile, a hard core of al-Shabaab fighters remained in Somalia to fight. In their April 2010 report, \u201cHarsh War, Harsh Peace\u201d, Human Rights Watch indicated that al-Shabaab was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity, but the group\u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda: defeating AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government and extending Sharia law across Somalia. Some of its leaders have links with al-Qaeda although the extent of al-Qaeda\u2019s influence over al-Shabaab remains unclear.\n52. Al-Shabaab has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground, especially in southern Somalia. They have received material support from the Eritrean government, which is eager to undercut Ethiopia\u2019s interests in the region. By the end of 2009 al-Shabaab controlled more territory than any other faction in Somalia, including Baidoa, the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament, Jowhar, which had been one of the Transitional Federal Government President\u2019s most reliable strongholds, and the strategic port of Kismayo.\n53. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala on 11 July 2010, which killed 79 people watching the World Cup soccer final on television. It was al-Shabaab\u2019s first attack outside Somalia and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond.\n##### 5. Hizbul Islam\n54. Hizbul Islam is another armed group which has both a Sharia agenda and the goal of driving AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government from Mogadishu. In early 2009 it entered into an alliance with al-Shabaab but the alliance came to an end in October 2009 during the fight for Kismayo. In December 2010, however, it once again merged with al\u2011Shabaab.\n##### 6. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca\n55. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca is an Islamist group which professes to support a more moderate agenda. The group exists primarily in central Somalia, where it has maintained control over large strips of territory, predominantly in Galgadud and Hiran regions.\n56. In February 2010 Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca signed a power-sharing and military unification pact with the Transitional Federal Government, although at times relations between the two groups were strained.\n### VI. RELEVANT CASE LAW\n#### A. NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076\n57. In NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076 the AIT found that conditions in southern Somalia and particularly in and around Mogadishu were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of Article 3 ill-treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them. Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection, although individual circumstances required separate consideration. Although women were at greater risk than men, they would not be able to show that, simply as lone female returnees from the United Kingdom, they had no place of clan safety. Finally, the AIT held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in Somalia did not engage the obligations of the Refugee Convention or engage Article 3 of the Convention for all female returnees. A differential impact had to be shown. Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator.\n58. The AIT observed in passing that, on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing, it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an IDP camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under Article 3, if not under the Refugee Convention.\n#### B. HH and Others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022\n59. In HH and others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that for the purposes of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a situation of internal armed conflict existed in Mogadishu. The AIT held, however, that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians, they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and, as a consequence, a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area.\n60. The AIT found that although clan support networks were strained, they had not yet collapsed. Majority clans continued to have arms, even though their militias no longer controlled the city. A person from a majority clan, or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with, or acceptance by, a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance, including at times of displacement. A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at r", "001-105777": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF HEINISCH v.

Germany,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nDean Spielmann, President,\nKarel Jungwiert,\nBo\u0161tjan M. Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nMark Villiger,\nIsabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre,\nAnn Power,\nAngelika Nu\u00dfberger, judges,\nand Claudia Westerdiek, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 June 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Relevant domestic law and practice\n1. Dismissal of an employee for having lodged a criminal complaint against the employer\n31. Apart from specific legislation with respect to civil servants exposing suspected cases of corruption, German law does not contain general provisions governing the disclosure of deficiencies in enterprises or institutions, such as illegal conduct on the part of the employer, by an employee (\u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d) and discussions on related draft legislation have for the time being not produced any results.\n(a) The relevant provisions of the German Civil Code and the Unfair Dismissal Act\n32. In the absence of such specific legislation, an extraordinary dismissal of an employee for having lodged a criminal complaint against his or her employer may be based on Article 626 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code, which provides that an employment relationship may be terminated by either party to the contract without complying with a notice period for a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d (wichtiger Grund). Facts must be present on the basis of which the party giving notice cannot reasonably be expected to continue the employment until the end of the notice period or to the agreed end of that relationship, taking all circumstances of the individual case into account and weighing up the interests of both parties to the contract.\n33. Section 1(1) of the Unfair Dismissal Act provides that termination of an employment relationship by the employer is unlawful if it is socially unjustified. Under section 1(2) of the Act, termination is socially unjustified unless it is, inter alia, based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct or continuation of the employment relationship would conflict with compelling requirements for the operation of the enterprise.\n(b) Case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court and Federal Labour Court\n34. In a decision of 2 July 2001 (file No. 1 BvR 2049/00) the Federal Constitutional Court ruled in a case where, at the request of the public prosecutor, an employee had given evidence and handed over documents in preliminary criminal investigations that had been instituted against his employer by the public prosecutor ex officio. The Federal Constitutional Court held that, in accordance with the rule of law, the discharge of a citizen\u2019s duty to give evidence in criminal investigations could not in itself entail disadvantages under civil law. The Federal Constitutional Court further pointed out in an obiter dictum that even in the event that an employee reported the employer to the public prosecution authorities on his or her own initiative, the rule of law required that such exercise of a citizen\u2019s right would, as a rule, not justify dismissal without notice, unless the employee had knowingly or frivolously reported incorrect information.\n35. In the light of the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law, the Federal Labour Court, in a judgment of 3 July 2003 (file No. 2 AZR 235/02), further elaborated on the relation between an employee\u2019s duty of loyalty towards the employer and the exercise of his or her constitutionally guaranteed rights. It reiterated that in reporting a criminal offence an employee had recourse to a means of implementing the law that was not only sanctioned by the legal order but also called for under the Constitution. An employee who exercised that right in good faith could not therefore incur a disadvantage in the event that the underlying allegations proved wrong or could not be clarified in the course of the ensuing proceedings. It held, however, that, taking into consideration the employee\u2019s duty of loyalty, a [criminal] complaint lodged by an employee must not constitute a disproportionate reaction in response to the employer\u2019s conduct. Indications of a disproportionate reaction by the complainant employee could be the justification of the complaint, the motivation of the person lodging the complaint or the failure to have previously drawn attention to the impugned deficiencies internally within the enterprise. In this context the employee\u2019s motives for lodging the complaint were of particular significance. A complaint that was lodged solely to cause damage to the employer or to \u201cwear him or her down\u201d could constitute a disproportionate reaction depending on the charges underlying the complaint. As regards the possibility of previous internal clarification of the allegations, the court stated that it had to be determined in each individual case whether such an approach could reasonably have been expected of the employee. It would not be expected if the latter had obtained knowledge of an offence which, if he or she failed to report it, would render him or her liable to criminal prosecution or in the event of a serious criminal offence or an offence committed by the employer himself. In addition, previous internal clarification of the matter was not required if redress could not legitimately be expected. If the employer failed to remedy an unlawful practice even though the employee had previously drawn his attention to that practice, the latter was no longer bound by a duty of loyalty towards his employer.\n#####", "001-106178": "\ufeff\nGRAND CHAMBER\nCASE OF PALOMO S\u00c1NCHEZ AND OTHERS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n19. The relevant provisions of the Spanish Constitution read as follows:\nArticle 20\n\u201c1. The following rights shall be recognised and protected:\n(a) the right freely to express and disseminate thoughts, ideas and opinions orally, in writing or by any other means of reproduction;\n...\n(d) the right to receive and communicate true information by any means of dissemination. ...\n2. The exercise of these rights may not be restricted by any prior censorship.\n...\n4. These freedoms shall be limited by respect for the rights secured in this Part, by the provisions of the implementing Acts and in particular by the right to honour and to a private life and the right to control use of one\u2019s likeness and to the protection of youth and children.\u201d\nArticle 28\n\u201c1. Everyone shall have the right to associate freely ... Freedom of association shall include the right to form trade unions or to join a trade union of one\u2019s choosing, and the right for trade unions to establish confederations and to set up or join international trade-union organisations. No one shall be obliged to join a trade union.\n...\u201d\n20. The relevant provisions of the Labour Regulations (approved by Royal Legislative Decree no. 1/1995 of 24 March 1995) read as follows:\nArticle 54 \u2013 Dismissal on disciplinary grounds\n\u201c1. The employer may decide to terminate a contract of employment by dismissing the employee for serious and negligent failure to perform his or her obligations.\n2. Non-compliance with contractual obligations shall include:\n...\n(c) Verbal or physical attacks on the employer or persons working in the company, or members of their families living with them.\u201d\nArticle 55\n\u201c...\n7. Justified dismissal shall entail the termination of the contract without any right of compensation ...\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The International Labour Organization\n21. On 23 June 1971 the General Conference of the International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted Recommendation No. 143 concerning workers\u2019 representatives, point 15 of which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Workers\u2019 representatives acting on behalf of a trade union should be authorised to post trade-union notices on the premises of the undertaking in a place or places agreed on with the management and to which the workers have easy access.\n2. The management should permit workers\u2019 representatives acting on behalf of a trade union to distribute news sheets, pamphlets, publications and other documents of the union among the workers of the undertaking.\n3. The union notices and documents referred to in this paragraph should relate to normal trade-union activities and their posting and distribution should not prejudice the orderly operation and tidiness of the undertaking.\u201d\n22. At its fifty-fourth session in June 1970, the International Labour Conference adopted a Resolution concerning trade-union rights and their relation to civil liberties. The Conference explicitly listed the fundamental rights essential for the exercise of freedom of association, in particular: (a) the right to freedom and security of person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; (b) freedom of opinion and expression and in particular freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers; (c) freedom of assembly; (d) the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal; and (e) the right to protection of the property of trade unions.\n23. In 1994 the ILO published a report entitled \u201cFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: Trade-Union Rights and Civil Liberties\u201d. The relevant passages of that report read as follows:\n\u201cPart I. Freedom of association and protection of the right to organise\nChapter II. Trade-union rights and civil liberties\nIntroduction\n...\n24. The Declaration of Philadelphia ... officially acknowledged the relationship between civil liberties and trade-union rights by proclaiming in Article I(b) that freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustained progress and referring in Article II(a) to the fundamental rights which are an inseparable part of human dignity. Since then, this relationship has been repeatedly affirmed and highlighted, both by the ILO\u2019s supervisory bodies and in the Conventions, Recommendations and Resolutions adopted by the International Labour Conference.\n...\n27. The information available, in particular on the nature of the complaints submitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association, shows that the main difficulties encountered by trade-union organisations and their leaders and members relate to basic rights, in particular to the right to security of the person, freedom of assembly, freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the right to protection of trade-union property and premises. ...\n...\nFreedom of opinion and expression\n38. Another essential aspect of trade-union rights is the right to express opinions through the press or otherwise. The full exercise of trade-union rights calls for a free flow of information, opinions and ideas, and workers, employers and their organisations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression at their meetings, in their publications, and in the course of their other activities. In cases in which the issue of a trade-union publication is subject to the granting of a licence, mandatory licensing should not be subject to the mere discretion of licensing authorities, nor should it be used as a means of imposing prior restraint on the subject matter of publications; in addition any application for such a licence should be dealt with promptly. ... Measures of administrative control \u2013 for example, the withdrawal of a licence granted to a trade-union newspaper, the control of printing plants and equipment, or the control of paper supply \u2013 should be subject to prompt and independent judicial review.\n39. An important aspect of freedom of expression is the freedom of speech of delegates of workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 organisations meetings, conferences and reunions, and in particular to the International Labour Conference. ...\n...\nState of emergency\n...\n43. The Committee considers that the guarantees set out in the international labour Conventions, in particular those relating to freedom of association, can only be effective if the civil and political rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international in", "001-106200": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ASHENDON AND JONES v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n26. Section 16(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 provides that where any person is tried on indictment and acquitted of any count in the indictment, the Crown Court may make a defendant\u2019s costs order in favour of the accused. Section 16(6) provides that such an order shall be for the payment out of central funds of such an amount as the court considers reasonably sufficient to compensate him for any expenses properly incurred by the defendant in the proceedings.\n27. The Practice Direction (On Costs in Criminal Proceedings) [2004] 2 Cr. App. R. 26 provides:\n\u201cWhere a person is not tried for an offence for which he has been indicted, or in respect of which proceedings against him have been sent for trial or transferred for trial, or has been acquitted on any count in the indictment, the court may make a defendant\u2019s costs order in his favour. Such an order should normally be made whether or not an order for costs between the parties is made, unless there are positive reasons for not doing so. For example, where the defendant\u2019s own conduct has brought suspicion on himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him was stronger than it was, the defendant can be left to pay his own costs. The court when declining to make a costs order should explain, in open court, that the reason for not making an order does not involve any suggestion that the defendant is guilty of any criminal conduct but the order is refused because of the positive reason that should be identified.\u201d\n28. In Dowler v. Merseyrail [2009] EWHC 558 (Admin), the High Court found that the phrases in the Practice Direction \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s own conduct has brought suspicion on himself\u201d and \u201chas misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him was stronger than it was\u201d had to be read conjunctively. A court could not refuse to make a defendant\u2019s costs order on the ground that a defendant had brought suspicion on himself unless it was also satisfied that he had also misled the prosecution into thinking the case against him was stronger than it was. The High Court also found that there was a duty to give reasons for not making an order.\n29. The High Court reached the same conclusion as to a conjunctive reading of the Practice Direction in R.

He relied on Article 3 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n28. He also complained under Article 8 about monitoring of his correspondence with the Court. The relevant part of the provision invoked reads as follows:\n\u201c1.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n24. Section 122 of the Federal Court Act of 17 June 2005, in force since 1 January 2007, provides as follows:\nSection 122: Breach of the European Convention on Human Rights\n\u201cAn application for review of a judgment of the Federal Court on account of a violation of the Convention of 4 November 1950 for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) may be submitted if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a) the European Court of Human Rights, in a final judgment, has found a violation of the ECHR or its Protocols;\n(b) compensation cannot remedy the effects of the violation;\n(c) the review is necessary to remedy the effects of the violation.\u201d\n25. The relevant provisions of Annex I of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the free movement of persons (the \u201cALCP\u201d) read as follows:\nArticle 1: Entry and exit\n\u201c1. The Contracting Parties shall allow nationals of the other Contracting Parties and members of their family within the meaning of Article 3 of this Annex and posted persons within the meaning of Article 17 of this Annex to enter their territory simply upon production of a valid identity card or passport.\nNo entry visa or equivalent requirement may be demanded save in respect of members of the family and posted workers within the meaning of Article 17 of this Annex who do not have the nationality of a Contracting Party. The Contracting Party concerned shall grant these persons every facility for obtaining any necessary visas.\n...\u201d\nArticle 3: Members of the family\n\u201c1. A person who has the right of residence and is a national of a Contracting Party is entitled to be joined by the members of his family. An employed person must possess housing for his family which is regarded as of normal standard for national employed persons in the region where he is employed, but this provision may not lead to discrimination between national employed persons and employed persons from the other Contracting Party.\n2. The following shall be regarded as members of the family, whatever their nationality:\n(a) his spouse and their relatives in the descending line who are under the age of 21 or are dependent;\n(b) his relatives in the ascending line and those of his spouse who are dependent on him;\n(c) in the case of a student, his spouse and their dependent children.\nThe Contracting Parties shall facilitate the admission of any member of the family not covered by the provisions of this paragraph under (a), (b) and (c), if that person is a dependant or lives in the household of the national of a Contracting Party in the country of provenance\n...\u201d\nArticle 5: Public order\n\u201c1. The rights granted under the provisions of this Agreement may be restricted only by means of measures which are justified on grounds of public order, public security or public health.\n...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

Relying on Article 46 of the Convention, the applicant contended that the interpretation by the Federal Court, in its judgment of 6 July 2009, of the Court\u2019s judgment of 22 May 2008, had not been consistent with the reasoning underlying the Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in that judgment. He further took the view that his exclusion from Switzerland for ten years, ordered by the Federal Court in the same judgment, constituted a fresh breach of his right to respect for his private and family life within the meaning of Article 8.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance\n21. The 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance (Lagen om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag, Act no. 1998:703, as in force at the relevant time), provides that a person who has reached the age of 16 and who, before reaching the age of 65, has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person on a daily basis or needs continuing assistance from another person in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses, may receive disability benefits (section 5, first paragraph). If the disabled person needs assistance either on a daily basis or in order to be gainfully employed and, in addition to this, has extra expenses, the issue of whether he or she is entitled to disability benefits and the amount of compensation shall be decided on basis of the total need of support (section 5, second paragraph). Thus, when making this assessment, it is necessary to look into the person\u2019s whole situation and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses incurred.\n22. It follows from section 6 of the 1998 Act that disability benefits are granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount for social security purposes (prisbasbelopp) depending on the extent to which the person in question is in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability. The basic amount was SEK 36,400 for 1999, SEK 36,600 for 2000 and SEK 36,900 for 2001.\n23. A medical report is required when it comes to the assessment of the functional impairment itself. As to the disabled person\u2019s need of support, regard must be had to the fact that support may be provided naturally to a certain extent by the person\u2019s husband or wife or another person with whom the person is living. If the support amounts to two hours per day, the need for assistance is considered time-consuming and may, for that reason, constitute a basis for granting disability benefits amounting to 36% of the basic amount, even if there are no extra expenses (see Guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board, Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket, AR 1998:5, applicable at the time of the Office\u2019s decision). As far as the assessment of extra costs is concerned, account has to be taken of whether and to what extent the disabled person has access to assistance provided by the municipal social services, such as having his or her own personal assistant or having the possibility of using municipal transport services for the disabled. According to the above-mentioned Guidelines, considerable extra expenses incurred as a consequence of the functional impairment may in themselves result in a right to disability benefits amounting to 36% of the basic amount, provided the extra expenses come to at least 28.5% of the basic amount. It is necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of the basic amount in order to make the individual eligible for disability benefit.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Administrative Offences Act\n42. By virtue of section 51(1) of the Administrative Offences Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz), the accused may lodge an appeal against a penal order with the Independent Administrative Panel.\n43. The administrative authority which has issued the impugned decision is a party to the proceedings before the Independent Administrative Panel (section 51(d)).\n#### B. The Federal Constitution\n44. Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes\u2011Verfassungsgesetz) Independent Administrative Panels are set up in the L\u00e4nder. The function of these panels includes determining both the factual and legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences.\n45. By virtue of Article 130 of the Federal Constitution the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to examine complaints alleging that a decision by an administrative authority or by an Independent Administrative Panel is unlawful.\n46. Article 131 (1) subparagraph (1) entitles a person who alleges that his or her rights have been violated by an administrative decision to lodge a complaint with the Administrative Court following exhaustion of appeals.\n47. Article 131 (1) subparagraph (2) of the Federal Constitution entitles the competent Minister, inter alia, in matters pertaining to the enforcement of federal laws by the L\u00e4nder, to lodge an official complaint with the Administrative Court against an allegedly unlawful decision of an administrative authority, following exhaustion of appeals by the parties.\n#### C. Administrative Court Act\n48. Section 26 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichts-hofgesetz) deals with time-limits for lodging complaints.\nPursuant to section 26(1) subparagraph (1), a complaint under Article 131(1) subparagraph (1) has to be brought within six weeks of the date of service of the decision or, if the decision was only pronounced orally, from the date of pronouncement.\nPursuant to section 26(1) subparagraph (2) an official complaint has to be brought within six weeks of the point when the decision at issue was served on the Federal Minister, or the Federal Minister becomes aware of the decision at issue.\n49. Section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act states that, except where otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision. Section 42(2) lists the grounds of unlawfulness of a decision. Section 42(3) provides that if the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision the proceedings are resumed at the stage they were at before that decision was issued.\n50. If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, \u201cthe administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court\u2019s view of the law\u201d (section 63(1)).\nTHE LAW\n### I.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 13 December 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Statutory provisions on mandatory life sentences\n29. In England and Wales, the mandatory life sentence for murder is contained in section 1(1) of the Murder (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Act 1965.\n30. The power of the Secretary of State to set tariff periods for mandatory life sentence prisoners, as contained in section 29 of the Crime Sentences Act 1997, was found by the House of Lords to be incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention in R (Anderson) v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] 1 AC 837. This led to the enactment of Chapter 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and schedules 21 and 22 to that Act.\n31. Section 269 of the 2003 Act directs a trial judge, in passing a mandatory life sentence, to determine the minimum term which the prisoner must serve before he or she is eligible for early release on licence. By section 269(3), this minimum term must take into account the seriousness of the offence. Section 269(4) allows the trial judge to decide that, because of the seriousness of the offence, the prisoner should not be eligible for early release (in effect, to make a \u201cwhole life order\u201d). Section 269(4) only applies to an offender who is 21 years of age or over when he committed the offence. Section 269(5) directs the trial judge, in considering the seriousness of the offence, to have regard inter alia to the principles set out in schedule 21 to the Act.\n##### 1. Schedule 21 to the 2003 Act\n32. Schedule 21 provides for three different \u201cstarting points\u201d which may be increased or decreased depending on the presence of aggravating or mitigating features in the offence: a whole life order, a minimum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment and a minimum term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\n33. By paragraph 4(1) of the schedule, if the seriousness of the offence is \u201cexceptionally high\u201d the appropriate starting point is a whole life order. Paragraph 4(2) provides that the following cases would normally fall within this category:\n(a) the murder of two or more persons, where each murder involves any of the following\u2014\n(i) a substantial degree of premeditation or planning,\n(ii) the abduction of the victim, or\n(iii) sexual or sadistic conduct,\n(b) the murder of a child if involving the abduction of the child or sexual or sadistic motivation,\n(c) a murder done for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause, or\n(d) a murder by an offender previously convicted of murder.\nBy paragraph 5(1), if the seriousness of the offence does not fall within paragraph 4(1) but is \u201cparticularly high\u201d, the appropriate starting point in determining the minimum term is thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. Paragraph 5(2) provides that the following cases would normally fall within this category:\n(a) the murder of a police officer or prison officer in the course of his duty,\n(b) a murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive,\n(c) a murder done for gain (such as a murder done in the course or furtherance of robbery or burglary, done for payment or done in the expectation of gain as a result of the death),\n(d) a murder intended to obstruct or interfere with the course of justice,\n(e) a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct,\n(f) the murder of two or more persons,\n(g) a murder that is racially or religiously aggravated or aggravated by sexual orientation, or\n(h) a murder falling within paragraph 4(2) committed by an offender who was aged under 21 when he committed the offence.\u201d\nParagraphs 6 and 7 provide that, in all other cases, the appropriate starting point in determining the minimum term is fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment (twelve years for those less than eighteen years of age).\nParagraphs 8 and 9 provide that, having chosen a starting point, the trial judge should take into account any aggravating or mitigating factors which may result in a minimum term of any length (whatever the starting point), or in the making of a whole life order.\nParagraph 10 provides that aggravating factors include:\n\u201c(a) a significant degree of planning or premeditation,\n(b) the fact that the victim was particularly vulnerable because of age or disability,\n(c) mental or physical suffering inflicted on the victim before death,\n(d) the abuse of a position of trust,\n(e) the use of duress or threats against another person to facilitate the commission of the offence,\n(f) the fact that the victim was providing a public service or performing a public duty, and\n(g) concealment, destruction or dismemberment of the body.\u201d\nParagraph 11 provides that mitigating factors include:\n(a) an intention to cause serious bodily harm rather than to kill,\n(b) lack of premeditation,\n(c) the fact that the offender suffered from any mental disorder or mental disability which (although not falling within section 2(1) of the Homicide Act 1957 (c. 11)), lowered his degree of culpability,\n(d) the fact that the offender was provoked (for example, by prolonged stress) in a way not amounting to a defence of provocation,\n(e) the fact that the offender acted to any extent in self-defence,\n(f) a belief by the offender that the murder was an act of mercy, and\n(g) the age of the offender.\u201d\n##### 2. Schedule 22 to the 2003 Act\n34. Schedule 22 enacts a series of transitional measures for those prisoners who were given mandatory life sentences prior to the entry into force of section 269 of the Act and whose minimum terms of imprisonment were set by the Secretary of State. It also applies to those prisoners whom the Secretary of State directed should never be eligible for early release on licence (that is, those prisoners for whom a whole life tariff had been set). Paragraph 3 of the schedule allows both categories of prisoners to apply to the High Court. Upon such an application the High Court must, in the case of a prisoner who is subject to a minimum term of imprisonment set by the Secretary of State, make an order specifying the minimum term that prisoner must serve before he or she is eligible for early release. Under paragraph 3(1)(b), where the Secretary of State notified the prisoner that a whole life tariff had been set, the High Court may make an order that the prisoner should not be eligible for release (\u201ca whole life order\u201d).\nThe minimum term set by the High Court must not be greater than that previously set by the Secretary of State (paragraph 3(1)(a)).\nSimilar provisions apply to sentences passed after the commencement of the Act in respect of murders committed before commencement. Paragraph 10 provides that the court may not make an order which, in its opinion, is greater than that which the Secretary of State would have been likely to have made under the previous practice.\n35. In determining an application under paragraph 3, the High Court must have regard inter alia to the seriousness of the offence and, in so doing, must also have regard to the general principles set out in schedule 21 and any recommendations to the Secretary of State by the trial judge or the Lord Chief Justice as to the minimum term to be served by the offender before release on licence (paragraphs 4 and 5 of schedule 22). The offender may also make representations to the High Court, including representations as to his or her behaviour and progress in prison since the offence, before the High Court determines the application. Representations can also be made by the victim or victims\u2019 families. The High Court may also hold an oral hearing in rare cases.\n#### B. The Secretary of State\u2019s discretion to release\n36. Section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 provides that the Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\nThe criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in Prison Service Order 4700 chapter 12, which, where relevant, provides:\n\u201c\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is ", "001-108663": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF REINER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n42. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, and the making, review and practical execution of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-78, 17 December 2009). The provisions relevant to the present case can be summarised as follows.\n#### A. The ordering of preventive detention by the sentencing court\n43. In accordance with the provisions on preventive detention since its incorporation into the Criminal Code, a sentencing court may, at the time of an offender\u2019s conviction, order the offender\u2019s preventive detention under certain circumstances in addition to a prison sentence if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public.\n44. Pursuant to Article 42e of the Criminal Code, in its version in force before 1 April 1970, preventive detention was to be ordered if, at the time of conviction, the offender had been considered a dangerous habitual offender within the meaning of Article 20a of the Criminal Code and if preventive detention was necessary for guaranteeing public safety. Article 20a of the Criminal Code ordered an increase of the penalty notably if a person was sentenced for an intentional offence to a term of imprisonment, if that person had already been sentenced twice for an intentional offence to at least six months\u2019 imprisonment in each case and if a comprehensive assessment of his offences led to the conclusion that he was a dangerous habitual offender.\n45. Article 42e of the Criminal Code, in its version in force as of 1 April 1970, set stricter conditions for the preventive detention of an offender. The sentencing court ordered preventive detention in addition to the penalty, in particular, if someone was convicted of an intentional offence and sentenced to at least two years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions were satisfied: firstly, the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already, to at least one year\u2019s imprisonment in each case, for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence. Secondly, the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for at least two years. Thirdly, a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the perpetrator presented a danger to the general public (see Article 42e \u00a7 1).\n46. Since 1 January 1975 the conditions for a preventive detention order have been laid down in Article 66 of the Criminal Code. That version of Article 66 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code corresponds to Article 42e \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code in the version in force since 1 April 1970.\n#### B. The order for execution of a preventive detention order\n47. Article 67c of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final. Paragraph 1 of the Article provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention, the court responsible for the execution of sentences (that is, a special chamber of the Regional Court composed of three professional judges \u2013 see sections 78a and 78b(1)(1) of the Court Organisation Act) ", "001-108670": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF KRONFELDNER v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n46. The applicant complained that the retrospective extension of his preventive detention from a maximum period of ten years to an unlimited period of time was unlawful and violated Article 5 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court; ...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\n(e) the lawful detention ... of persons of unsound mind, ...; ...\u201d\n47. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The Government\n48. In their further observations dated 1 December 2010, made in reply to the applicant\u2019s observations, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He had not yet obtained a decision of the Federal Court of Justice on the continuation of his preventive detention in the fresh review proceedings initiated in 2010 (see paragraphs 26 ss. above). Following the development in the domestic courts\u2019 case-law after the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany, this review was an effective remedy for the applicant to obtain his release which he therefore had to exhaust.\n49. In their further observations dated 14 June 2011 the Government objected that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies also for another reason. They argued that in its leading judgment of 4 May 2011 on preventive detention (see paragraphs 41-45 above), the Federal Constitutional Court had introduced a new domestic remedy for review of the ongoing preventive detention of persons concerned by that judgment. In particular, in parallel cases to the M. v. Germany case (cited above), in which preventive detention had been extended beyond the former ten-year maximum duration, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences could only order the continuation of that detention under restrictive conditions. The preventive detention of the persons concerned could only be prolonged if, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, they were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder within the meaning of sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 \u00a7 1. If that was not the case, the detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The applicant had been obliged to exhaust that new domestic remedy.\n50. The Government further took the view that the applicant could no longer claim to be the victim of a violation of his Convention rights. In its above-mentioned judgment, the Federal Constitutional Court had implemented the findings the Court had made in its judgments on German preventive detention. The Convention violations found have thus partly been remedied by the Federal Constitutional Court in its transitional rules, and will partly be remedied as soon as possible.\n(b) The applicant\n51. The applicant took the view that he had exhausted domestic remedies. He was not obliged to await the outcome of the new proceedings for review of the necessity of his preventive detention.\n52. The applicant further considered that he could still claim to be the victim of a breach of Article 5 of the Convention. He stressed that the Court\u2019s findings in its judgment in the M. v. Germany case had not been implemented in his case, neither before nor after the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s leading judgment of 4 May 2011. His situation in preventive detention had remained unchanged.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) Exhaustion of domestic remedies\n53.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n18. Chapter 16, Article 8 of the Penal Code (Brottsbalken, SFS 1962:700) provides that a person who, in a disseminated statement or communication, threatens or expresses contempt for a national, ethnic or other such group of persons with allusion to race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual orientation, should be convicted of agitation against a national or ethnic group. The offence carries a penalty of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. If the offence is considered minor the penalty is a fine, and if it is considered to be aggravated the penalty is imprisonment for no less than six months and no more than four years.\n19. Agitation against homosexuals as a group was made a criminal offence by an amendment of the law that came into effect on 1 January 2003. According to the preparatory work on that amendment, as reproduced in Government Bill 2001/02:59 (pp. 32-33), homosexuals constitute an exposed group which is often subjected to criminal acts because of their sexual orientation, and national socialist and other racist groups agitate against homosexuals and homosexuality as part of their propaganda. The preparatory work also stated that there were good reasons to assume that the homophobic attitude that had caused certain offenders to attack individuals on account of their sexual orientation derived from the hate, threat and inflammatory propaganda against homosexuals as a group that was spread by the majority of Nazi and other right-wing extremist groups in the country.\n20. The Supreme Court, in its judgment of 29 November 2005 (case NJA 2005 p. 805) concerning statements made by a pastor during a sermon which were deemed to have expressed contempt for homosexuals as a group within the meaning of Chapter 16, Article 8 of the Penal Code, considered that the legislation was in accordance with the Convention. However, the Supreme Court found that, the word \u201ccontempt\u201d in the provision regarding incitement against a group had to be interpreted more restrictively than the preparatory work appeared to indicate if an application of the provisions that was in line with the Convention was to be achieved. The Supreme Court then found that an application of the provision that was in line with the Convention would not permit a judgment convicting the defendant, given the circumstances of the case, and rejected the charges.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n21.

Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...\n2.

He further complained that his complaint had not been examined effectively. In this connection, the applicant relied on Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention.\n26. The Government disputed the allegations.\n27. The Court considers that these complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 3 alone, which reads:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n##### 1. Admissibility\n28. The Government asked the Court to dismiss this part of the application for non-compliance with the six-month time-limit. In this connection, they drew the Court\u2019s attention to the lengthy period of time that had elapsed between the date on which the applicant\u2019s police custody had ended, namely, on 30 October 2000, and the date on which the applicant had filed a complaint with the public prosecutor, namely, on 7 June 2007.\n29. The Court takes note of the fact that the applicant waited for more than seven years before lodging a separate complaint with the public prosecutor regarding his allegations of ill-treatment. Nevertheless, following his complaint, an investigation was initiated by the Diyarbak\u0131r Public Prosecutor and the merits of his case were examined both by the prosecutor\u2019s office and by the Siverek Assize Court. Consequently, the final decision regarding the applicant\u2019s allegations of ill-treatment was delivered by the Siverek Assize Court on 26 June 2009.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n38. According to section 1 \u00a7 2 and section 2 of the 1990 Act, compulsory public care is to be provided if there is a clear risk of impairment of the health and development of a person under 18 years of age due to ill-treatment, exploitation, lack of care or any other condition in the home and if the necessary care cannot be provided with the consent of the child\u2019s guardian. The decision to place a child in public care is made by the County Administrative Court following an application from the Social Council (section 4).\n39. Chapter 1, section 2 of the Social Services Act (Socialtj\u00e4nstlagen, 2001:453; hereafter the \u201c2001 Act\u201d) provides that particular attention must be given to the best interests of the child when measures within the social services affect him or her. Likewise, Section 1 \u00a7 5 of the 1990 Act states that the best interests of the young person shall be decisive when decisions are made under the Act. Moreover, Section 1 \u00a7 6 of the 1990 Act prescribes that the young person\u2019s point of view shall, as far as possible, be clarified and that the young person\u2019s will shall be taken into account, with due consideration to his or her age and maturity.\n40. According to section 11 of the 1990 Act, the Social Council decides on the details of the care, in particular, how the care is to be arranged and where the young person is to live. Moreover, under section 14, the council shall ensure that the young person\u2019s need for contact with his or her parents or other guardians is met to the utmost possible extent. If necessary, the council may decide how this contact is to be arranged. In the preparatory works to the 1990 Act (Government Bill 1979/80:1, p. 602), it is noted that the provisions on contact restrictions are to be applied restrictively. The Social Council must have strong reasons to decide on contact restrictions between a young person and his or her parents. However, it can happen that the parents intervene in the care in an inappropriate manner. Their personal situation, for instance serious abuse or a grave mental illness, may be such that they should not see their child for a limited period of time.\n41. According to Chapter 6, section 1 of the 2001 Act, care outside a young person\u2019s home shall be provided either in a family home or in a home for care and residence. Moreover, the care should be designed to promote the affinity between the young person and his or her relatives and others closely connected to him or her, as well as contact", "001-109791": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF RANGELOV v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions governing preventive detention\n39. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, and the making, review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-78, 17 December 2009). The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows:\n##### 1. The order of preventive detention by the sentencing court\n40. The sentencing court may, at the time of the offender\u2019s conviction, order his preventive detention (a so-called measure of correction and prevention) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence (a penalty), if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public (Article 66 of the Criminal Code).\n41. In particular, the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to at least two years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already, to at least one year\u2019s imprisonment in each case, for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence. Secondly, the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for at least two years. Thirdly, a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public (see Article 66 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force at the relevant time).\n2. The order for the execution of preventive detention by the court responsible for the execution of sentences\n42. Article 67c of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final. Paragraph 1 of the Article provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention, the court responsible for the execution of sentences (that is, a special Chamber of the Regional Court composed of three professional judges, see sections 78a and 78b (1)(1) of the Court Organisation Act) must review, before completion of the prison term, whether the person\u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective. If that is not the case, it suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and places the person on probation with supervision of their conduct which commences with the suspension.\n##### 3. Judicial review and duration of preventive detention\n43. Article 67d of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention. Paragraph 2, first sentence, of that Article, in its version in force at the relevant time, provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time-limit has not yet expired, the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release.\n44. Pursuant to Article 67e of the Criminal Code, the court (that is, the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended and a measure of probation applied. It is obliged to do so within fixed time-limits (paragraph 1 of Article 67e). For persons in preventive detention, this time-limit is two years (paragraph 2 of Article 67e).\n#### B. Provision on the execution of sentences in cases of expulsion\n45. Pursuant to Article 456a \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office may dispense with the execution of a prison sentence or a measure of correction and prevention if the convicted person is expelled from German territory. The execution of the sentence or measure may be continued if the expelled person returns to Germany territory (Article 456a \u00a7 2 of the", "001-110246": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF STR\u00d6MBLAD v.

RELEVANT LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The population register\n41. According to the National Registration Act (folkbokf\u00f6ringslagen, 1991:481 \u2013hereafter \u201cthe Act\u201d), the general rule is that a person is registered in the population register at the address where he or she has his or her regular place of residence (Sections 6 and 7 of the Act).\n42. However, Section 20 of the Act states that a person who can be assumed in his or her daily life, regularly to spend the night out of the country for a period of at least one year, shall be removed from the population register as having emigrated.\n43. A change of address or a move abroad of a child shall be reported to the Tax Authority by the child\u2019s guardian (Section 30 of the Act). If the parents have joint custody, both have to consent to the reported change (judgment by the Supreme Administrative Court, R\u00c5 1995 ref. 74). Still, the Tax Authority may decide to register a change of address or move abroad on its own initiative if there are reasons for it (Section 34 of the Act).\n#### B. The Hague Convention\n44. The Articles of the Hague Convention, relevant for the present case, read as follows:\nArticle 3\nThe removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where \u2013\na) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and\nb) at the time of the removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.\nThe rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.\nArticle 11\nThe judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.\nIf the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay. If a reply is received by the Central Authority of the requested State, that Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be.\nArticle 15\nThe judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State may, prior to the making of an order for the return of the child, request that the applicant obtain from the authorities of the State of the habitual residence of the child a decision or other determination that the removal or retention was wrongful within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, where such a decision or determination may be obtained in that State. The Central Authorities of the Contracting States shall so far as practicable assist applicants to obtain such a decision or determination.\n#### C. Domestic practice and ongoing legislative work concerning compensation for violations of the Convention\n45.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n16. Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n17. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n18. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n19. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:\n\u201c353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\nA fresh claim, if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of State, and if refused, gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits. If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim, their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim.\n#### B. Relevant case-law\n20. In J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n21. The Court of Appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test. It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3.

The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure read as follows:\nArticle 2\n\u201cAnyone who has personally suffered damage directly caused by a criminal offence may bring civil-party proceedings to seek compensation for such damage. ...\u201d\nArticle 3\n\u201cCivil-party proceedings may be conducted simultaneously with the public prosecution and before the same court.\nCivil-party proceedings may be brought for any head of damage, whether pecuniary or physical or non-pecuniary, caused by the acts under prosecution\u201d\nArticle 4\n\u201cCivil-party proceedings may also be conducted separately from the public prosecution, before a civil court.\nHowever, judgment in civil-party proceedings brought in a civil court shall be suspended until final judgment has been given in any public prosecution.\nSetting the public prosecution in motion does not suspend the other actions before the civil court, whatever their nature, even if the decision to bring criminal proceedings is likely to directly or indirectly influence the outcome of the civil proceedings.\u201d\nArticle 5\n\u201cA party who has brought proceedings in a civil court may not refer the same complaint to a criminal court unless the prosecution has preferred charges in that court before the civil court has ruled on the merits.\u201d\nArticle 6\n\u201cThe public prosecution for the imposition of a penalty is extinguished by the death of the defendant or by limitation, amnesty, the repeal of the criminal law and res judicata.\u201d\nArticle 10\n\u201cWhen civil action is taken before a criminal court, limitation is governed by the rules of public prosecution. When the action is taken before a civil court, limitation is governed by the Civil Code.\nWhen the court has made a ruling on the public prosecution, the investigative measures ordered by the criminal court on the civil claims alone are governed by the rules of civil procedure.\u201d\n#### B. The case-law of the Court of Cassation\n28. When criminal and civil proceedings are brought simultaneously before the criminal court, the civil action is considered contingent on the outcome of the criminal prosecution (see, for example, Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 19 May 1969, Bull. crim. no. 173).\n29. The public prosecution is extinguished by the death of the accused during the appeal on points of law. When the Investigations Division of the Court of Appeal decides to discontinue the proceedings, the criminal courts can no longer rule on the criminal proceedings and therefore have no authority to examine the civil action (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 5 May 1998, Bull. crim. no. 149). If the accused dies before any decision is reached on the merits, the criminal court has no authority to examine the civil act", "001-110322": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF ERIKSSON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Work Injury Insurance\n18. According to the Work Injury Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, 1976:380, hereinafter the \u201c1976 Act\u201d), as in force at the relevant time, the term \u201cwork injury\u201d mainly refers to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful factors at a person\u2019s work place (Chapter 2, Section 1 of the 1976 Act). Under the 1976 Act, all gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against work injuries. The insurance scheme is mainly administered by the Social Insurance Office and includes, among other things, compensation for loss of earnings such as life annuity. The Office must obtain a medical opinion concerning the injury and has physicians with different areas of medical expertise attached to it to assist in this exercise. The assessment of whether an injury qualifies as a work injury, as well as of the degree of reduction of a person\u2019s ability to engage in gainful employment, shall be made on the basis of the available medical opinions, the insurance office doctor\u2019s assessment of these opinions and all other relevant information.\n19. For an injury to qualify as a work injury, a causal link must be established between the accident or harmful effect in the workplace and the insured person\u2019s health problems. By \u201charmful effect\u201d was meant the influence of a factor that is very likely to cause an injury or illness such as that suffered by the insured person (Chapter 2, Section 1 of the 1976 Act).\n20. Under the amendments entering into force on 1 January 1993, which applied to the applicant\u2019s case, it had to be shown that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d, and not merely \u201cprobable\u201d as prior to the amendment, that a certain factor in the working environment could cause a person\u2019s injuries and, thereby, be considered as having harmful effects (Chapter 2, Section 1\u20112 of the 1976 Act). The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires (Government Bill 1992/93:30, p. 20 and p. 36) state that this implies that the responsible authorities have to consider more extensively than previously whether the exposure to a harmful effect at work has been of such a degree, intensity and duration that, from this, it can be concluded that the existence of harmfulness is highly probable. Furthermore, the collected knowledge must indicate with a considerable degree of probability that a factor in the environment is harmful. The view that a certain factor is very likely to cause an injury has to be relatively generally accepted. This is the case where substantial knowledge exists, within medical or other science, that a certain factor has such harmful effects. If there is a lack of support, as when, for example, there are profound differences in expert opinions, this requirement cannot be considered fulfilled. Thus, the opinion of a specific researcher or medical doctor should not constitute sufficient basis for a positive decision on the issue of harmful effects. The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires also state that the more rigid requirement of harmfulness in many cases presupposes more careful investigations at workplaces regarding the harmful factors invoked and that the question of causes of certain diseases has to be discussed more thoroughly. This, in turn, will result in the authorities basing their decisions more extensively on different assessments of harmfulness within medical science.\n#### B. Procedure before the administrative courts\n21. A decision rendered by the Social Insurance Office regarding work injuries may be appealed against to the administrative courts. However, in these cases leave to appeal is required for the Administrative Court of Appeal to consider an appeal on the merits against a decision or judgment delivered by the County Administrative Court (Sect", "001-110379": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KORGUL v.

It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n##### 1. The AMA Act\n13. The Federal Act Establishing the Market Regulation Institution \u201cAgrarmarkt Austria\u201d, Federal Law Gazette 376/1992 (Bundesgesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung der Marktordnungsstelle \u201cAgrarmarkt Austria\u201d, BGBl 276/1992 \u2013 \u201cthe AMA Act\u201d) defines \u201cAgrarmarkt Austria (\u201cAMA\u201d)\u201d as a corporate body under public law (AMA Act section 2 paragraph 1). Its tasks comprise, inter alia, the promotion of agricultural marketing (AMA Act section 3 paragraph 1 (3)).\n14. According to the AMA Act section 21a AMA collects agricultural marketing charges (Agrarmarketingbeitrag) for the following aims: (i) promoting and securing the distribution of domestic agricultural and forestry products and related processed goods, (ii) opening up and maintaining markets for these products in Austria and abroad, (iii) improving the distribution of these products, (iv) promoting general measures for improving and maintaining the quality of these products (in particular agricultural products) and for providing relevant information to the consumer regarding the quality of the products and (v) promoting other marketing measures (in particular by means of offering its services and bearing personnel costs).\n15. AMA finances its activities by levying charges. Under Section 21c in conjunction with sections 21e of the AMA Act, inter alia, individuals and companies operating establishments for slaughtering and butchery of cattle, calves, pigs, lambs and sheep are liable to AMA for agricultural marketing charges. The duty to pay these charges arises at the time the animals are slaughtered (AMA Act section 21f paragraph 1 (3)).\n16. Section 21g of the AMA Act, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c(1) A debtor in respect of the charge has to submit a declaration of the charge due within the time-limit set out in section 21f para. 2 or 3, making use of a standard form provided for this purposes by AMA, in which he himself has to calculate, ... the charge to be paid ...\n(2) If the debtor has not paid the charge at all, not paid in due time or not in the correct amount, AMA has to make an order for payment of the charge, issuing a formal written decision.\n(3) If AMA establishes that the charge was not paid at all or not paid in the correct amount, it may increase up to double the amount due. In fixing the increased amount, it must be taken into account to what extent the debtor could be expected to be aware of the debt and whether the non-payment or insufficient payment had occurred for the first time or repeatedly. In cases of late payment AMA may impose default interest exceeding the base interest rate (Basiszinssatz) by 3%, unless this would constitute unacceptable hardship in the individual case.\u201d\n17. The collection of the charges is incumbent on the AMA. Appeals against its declaratory decisions can be made to the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n25. The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case, concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in Sweden, are laid down in the Aliens Act (Utl\u00e4nningslagen, 2005:716 \u2013 hereafter referred to as \u201cthe Aliens Act\u201d), as amended on 1 January 2010. The following refers to the Aliens Act in force at the relevant time.\n26. Chapter 5, Section 1, of the Aliens Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden. According to Chapter 4, Section 1, of the Aliens Act, the term \u201crefugee\u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, religious or political beliefs, or on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities cannot be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals. By \u201can alien otherwise in need of protection\u201d is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment, or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 4, Section 2, of the Aliens Act).\n27. Moreover, if a residence permit cannot be granted on the above grounds, such a permit may be issued to an alien if, after an overall assessment of his or her situation, there are such particularly distressing circumstances (synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter) to allow him or her to remain in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 6 of the Aliens Act).\n28. As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order, account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement, an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 12, Section 1, of the Aliens Act). In addition, an alien must not, in principle, be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution (Chapter 12, Section 2, of the Aliens Act).\n29. Under certain conditions, an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force. This applies, under Chapter 12, Section 18, of the Aliens Act, where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing, inter alia, that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced. If a residence permit cannot be granted under this provision, the Migration Board may instead decide to re-examine the matter. Such a re-examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed, on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien, that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in Chapter 12, Sections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so. Should the applicable conditions not have been met, the Migration Board shall decide not to grant a re-examination (Chapter 12, Section 19, of the Aliens Act).\n30. It should also be noted that Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Aliens Act defines a child as a person under 18 years of age.\n31.

Domestic provisions of relevance to the present case are found mainly in the Enforcement Code (Uts\u00f6kningsbalken; 1981:774) and the Enforcement Ordinance (Uts\u00f6kningsf\u00f6rordningen; 1981:981). The Enforcement Authority is responsible for enforcement of judgments or other enforcement titles (exekutionstitel) comprising an obligation to pay or some other obligation. Enforcement cases are dealt with as public cases (allm\u00e4nna m\u00e5l), as in the applicant\u2019s case, or private cases (enskilda m\u00e5l; cf. Chapter 1, Article 6 of the Enforcement Code). Public cases are, for example, imposition of fines, taxes, and other funds to which the State is entitled.\n19. According to Chapter 3, Article 1, of the Enforcement Code, an enforcement title may consist of a court judgment, but also of a decision of an administrative authority that may be enforced in accordance with a special regulation. Moreover, according to Article 23 of the same Chapter, enforcement titles in public cases may be enforced before they have gained legal force, if this has been specially prescribed. In this respect, Chapter 2, Article 19 of the Enforcement Code stipulates that a decision of the Enforcement Authority applies immediately, and the enforcement continues even if the decision is appealed against, unless otherwise prescribed by the Enforcement Code or ordered by a court.\n20. In line with Chapter 4, Article 9 of the Enforcement Code, the Enforcement Authority shall investigate the debtor\u2019s employment and income situation and whether he or she has attachable property. Attachment shall take place as soon as possible after the necessary documents have been received by the Enforcement Authority (Chapter 4, Article 10). With some exceptions, notification shall be sent to the debtor by post or given in an appropriate manner within such time that the debtor can be expected to have sufficient time to protect his or her rights (Chapter 4, Article 12).

Unlawfulness of a final decision can only originate in obvious errors committed by a court, caused by a flagrant breach of the principles of interpretation or application of law. ...

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relating to search and seizure\n19. Articles 139 to 149 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the version in force at the material time concerned the search of premises and persons and the seizure of objects.\n20. Article 139 \u00a7 1 provided, in particular, that a search may be carried out only if there is reasonable suspicion that a person suspected of having committed an offence is hiding on the premises concerned, or that there are objects on the premises the possession or examination of which is relevant to a particular criminal investigation.\n21. Pursuant to Article 140 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, a search should, in general, be carried out only after the person concerned has been questioned, and only if the person sought has not come forward of his or her own volition or the object or objects sought have not been voluntarily produced and if the reasons warranting the search were not eliminated during the questioning. No such questioning is required where delay would be detrimental.\n22. Article 140 \u00a7 3 stated that a search may, as a rule, only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge.\n23. Pursuant to Article 142 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, the occupant of the premises subject to the search or, if he is unavailable, a relative of the occupant, must be present during the search. A report is to be drawn up and signed by all those present.\n24. Article 143 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided that, if objects relevant to the investigation or subject to forfeiture or confiscation are found, they are to be listed and taken to the court for safe keeping or seized.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Caravan Sites Act 1968\n33. Part I of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (\u201cthe 1968 Act\u201d) provides limited security of tenure to certain occupiers of caravans and caravan sites. Section 2 provides that at least four weeks\u2019 notice of termination of a licence to occupy a caravan site must be given.\n34. Section 4(1) provides that when a court makes an order for the removal or exclusion of an occupier from a caravan site, it may suspend the enforcement of that order for up to twelve months at a time.\n35. Section 4(4) provides that in considering whether or how to exercise its powers under this section, the court shall have regard to all the circumstances, and in particular to the questions:\n\u201c(a) whether the occupier of the caravan has failed, whether before or after the expiration or determination of the relevant residential contract, to observe any terms or conditions of that contract, any conditions of the site licence, or any reasonable rules made by the owner for the management and conduct of the site or the maintenance of caravans thereon;\n(b) whether the occupier has unreasonably refused an offer by the owner to renew the residential contract or make another such contract for a reasonable period and on reasonable terms;\n(c) whether the occupier has failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain elsewhere other suitable accommodation for his caravan (or, as the case may be, another suitable caravan and accommodation for it).\u201d\n36. Section 4(6) of the 1968 Act formerly excluded the court\u2019s power to suspend the enforcement of a possession order under section 4(1) in the case of possession proceedings brought by local authorities. However, the exclusion of local authority caravan sites from the ambit of the power to suspend under section 4(1) was removed by the Housing Act 2004, which entered into force on 18 January 2005, in respect of proceedings begun on or after that date.\n#### B. The Mobile Homes Act 1983\n37. The Mobile Homes Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) was enacted, inter alia, to restrict the eviction from caravan sites of occupiers of caravans. It applies to any agreement under which a person is entitled to station a mobile home on land forming part of a \u201cprotected site\u201d and to occupy it as his only or main residence and implies into licence agreements falling within the ambit of its provisions various protective terms.\n38. Section 2(1) and paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the 1983 Act provide that the owner of a relevant site is entitled to terminate the licence only if (i) he satisfies the court that the occupier has breached a term of the licence agreement and has failed to comply with a ", "001-113137": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF FALTER ZEITSCHRIFTEN GMBH v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Kafala\n##### 1. The legal arrangement of kafala in Islamic law\n15. Adoption, emanating from classical Roman law, which based it on the \u201cimitation of nature\u201d (the principle of adoptio naturam imitatur in the Institutes of Justinian) creates, between the adopter and the adoptee, a legal relationship that is identical to that existing between parent and child. Although certain States make a distinction between several levels of adoption (most often between full adoption and simple adoption), this characteristic is always present.\n16. Under Islamic law adoption is prohibited (haraam). However, the right is accorded a special institution: kafala or \u201clegal care\u201d. In Muslim States, with the exception of Turkey, Indonesia and Tunisia, kafala is defined as a voluntary undertaking to provide for a child and take care of his or her welfare, education and protection.\n17. The procedural arrangements for establishing kafala depend on the domestic law of each Muslim State. The relevant provisions of the Algerian Family Code thus read as follows:\nArticle 46\n\u201cAdoption (tabanni) is prohibited by the Sharia and by legislation.\u201d\nArticle 116\n\u201cKafala is an undertaking to assume responsibility for supporting, educating and protecting a minor child in the same manner as a father would care for his son. It is established by a legal act.\u201d\nArticle 117\n\u201cKafala is granted upon appearance before the judge or notary, with the child\u2019s consent when he or she has a father and mother.\u201d\nArticle 118\n\u201cThe holder of the right of kafala (the kafil) must be a Muslim, a sensible and upright person, and be in a position to support the fostered child (the makfoul), with the capacity to protect him or her.\u201d\nArticle 119\n\u201cThe fostered child may be of known or unknown parentage.\u201d\nArticle 120\n\u201cThe fostered child shall retain his or her original legal parent-child relationship if of known parentage. Otherwise, Article 64 of the Civil Status Code shall be applied in respect of the child.\u201d\nArticle 124\n\u201cShould the father and mother, or one of them, request the reinstatement under their guardianship of the fostered child, it will be for the child, provided he or she is of an age of discernment, to choose whether or not to return to his parents.\nIf the child is not of such an age, he may be returned only with the judge\u2019s authorisation, taking into account the interests of the fostered child.\u201d\n##### 2. Reference to kafala in international instruments\n18. Articles 20 and 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, of 20 November 1989, read as follows:\nArticle 20\n\u201c1. A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State.\n2. States Parties shall in accordance with their national laws ensure alternative care for such a child.\n3. Such care could include, inter alia, foster placement, Kafala of Islamic law, adoption, or if necessary placement in suitable institutions for the care of children. When considering solutions, due regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child\u2019s upbringing and to the child\u2019", "001-114097": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF G\u0141OWACKI v.

In the event of infringement [the person concerned] may also require the party who caused the infringement to take the necessary steps to remove the consequences of the infringement ... In compliance with the principles of this Code [the person concerned] may also seek pecuniary compensation or may ask the court to award an appropriate sum for the benefit of a specific public interest.\u201d\n49. Under Article 448 of the Civil Code, a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation. That provision, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201cThe court may grant an appropriate sum as pecuniary compensation for non-material damage (krzywda) to anyone whose personal rights have been infringed.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Employment Rights Act 1996\n23. Under section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer. By section 98(1), an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section 98(2), which includes \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201csome other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held\u201d.\nSection 98(4) deals with fairness:\n\u201cWhere the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection (1), the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to the reason shown by the employer) \u2013\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer\u2019s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.\u201d\n24. However, paragraph 106 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) Section 94 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than one year ending with the effective date of termination.\u201d\n25. Section 108(3) of the Employment Rights Act provides a wide variety of exceptions from the one-year qualifying period, many of which derive from the United Kingdom\u2019s implementation of European Community legislation in the field of employment. These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave, refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998, or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer. Moreover, applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race, sex or religion are also exempt from the one-year qualifying period.\n#### B. The Race Relations Act 1976\n26. Section 1 (1) (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 states the following:\n\u201cA person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-\n(a) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u201d\nSection 1 A of the Race Relations Act 1976 states:\n\u201c A person also discriminates against another if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection (IB), he applies to that other provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but\n(a) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons;\n(b) which puts that other at that disadvantage, and\n(c) which he cannot show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Leave to enter for spouses\n##### 1. The Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended)\n16. At the relevant time paragraph 352A of the Immigration Rules contained the requirements for family reunion for refugees. It provided that:\n\u201cThe requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse or civil partner of a refugee are that:\n(i) the applicant is married to or the civil partner of a person granted asylum in the United Kingdom ; and\n(ii) the marriage or civil partnership did not take place after the person granted asylum left the country of his former habitual residence in order to seek asylum; and\n(iii) the applicant would not be excluded from protection by virtue of article 1F of the United Nations Convention and Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees if he were to seek asylum in his own right; and\n(iv) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the other as his or her spouse or civil partner and the marriage is subsisting; and\n(v) if seeking leave to enter, the applicant holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity.\u201d\n17. Consequently, at the relevant time a refugee could only be joined in the United Kingdom by a spouse pursuant to paragraph 352A if the marriage took place before leaving the country of formal habitual residence.\n18.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n45. The disputed decisions taken by the Immigration Appeals Board on 31 August 2007 in the present case relied notably on section 8, second sub\u2011paragraph, of the 1988 Immigration Act (subsequently replaced by a new Immigration Act in 2008, which entered into force on 1 January 2010). Section 8 read:\n\u201cAny foreign national has on application the right to a work permit or a residence permit in accordance with the following rules:\n1) Subsistence and housing must be ensured in accordance with further rules laid down in regulations issued by the King.\n2) The conditions for work and residence permits laid down in regulations pursuant to section 5, second paragraph, must be fulfilled.\n3) There must not be circumstances which would constitute a ground pursuant to other provisions of this Act for refusing the foreign national leave to enter the realm, to reside or to work there.\nEven if these requirements are not fulfilled a work or a residence permit may be granted if warranted by strong humanitarian considerations, or if a foreign national has a special attachment to Norway.

The applicants complained that their deportation to Pakistan would entail an interference with their rights under Article 8 of the Convention that would be disproportionate and not \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. This Article reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n47. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n48. The Court reiterates that this is the second application brought by the same applicants in relation to the same case-complex.

After the applicants\u2019 request under Rule 39 to stay their deportation to Pakistan was refused, they did not wish to pursue their application. On 6 February 2008, a Committee decided to strike the application out of the Court\u2019s list of cases (see paragraph 16 above).\n49.

During the investigation, the blocking of access may be ordered by the public prosecutor in cases where a delay in acting could have harmful effects. The order must then be submitted to the judge for approval within twenty-four hours. The judge must give a decision within a further twenty-four hours. If he or she does not approve the blocking of access, the measure shall be lifted by the prosecutor forthwith. Blocking orders issued as a preventive measure may be appealed against in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271).\n(3) A copy of the blocking order issued by the judge, court or public prosecutor shall be sent to the [Telecommunications and Information Technology] Directorate for execution.\n(4) Where the content provider or the hosting service provider is abroad ... the blocking order shall be issued by the Directorate of its own motion. It shall then be notified to the access provider with a request for execution.\n(5) Blocking orders shall be implemented immediately or at the latest twenty-four hours after notification.\n...\n(7) If the criminal investigation ends in a decision to discontinue the proceedings, the blocking order shall automatically cease to apply ...\n(8) Where the trial ends in an acquittal, the blocking order shall automatically cease to apply ...\n(9) If the illegal content is removed, the blocking order shall be lifted ...\u201d\n16. The Telecommunications and Information Technology Directorate was established under provisional section 7 of Law no. 2559 on police powers and responsibilities, as amended on 3 July 2005 by Law no. 5397. As an administrative body it is responsible, among other tasks, for recording and monitoring information disseminated using telecommunications tools.\n17. In practice, where a court orders the blocking of access to a specific website, it falls to the T\u0130B to implement the measure. If the content provider or hosting service provider is abroad, the T\u0130B may block all access to the pages of the intermediary service provider under section 8(3) and (4) of Law no. 5651. Therefore, the issuing of a blocking order does not result only in access to the website which is the subject of criminal proceedings being blocked; access to all the content on the Internet domain concerned is also liable to be blocked. Thus, domains such as blogspot.com, blogger.com, Google Groups, myspace.com and youtube.com have been the subject of blocking orders over long periods of time because of the websites which they host.\n18. The notion of what constitutes a \u201cpublication\u201d within the meaning of section 2(1) of Law no. 5651 has also been the subject of debate among legal commentators. In the view of some commentators, sub-paragraph (\u011f), according to which the concept of \u201cInternet publication\u201d denotes \u201cdata which can be accessed via the Internet by an indeterminate number of persons\u201d is in contradiction with the notion contained in subsection (l) of the same section, which states that \u201c[p]ublication [(yay\u0131n) shall mean] publication on the Internet\u201d. The difficulty stems from the reference to \u201cdata which can be accessed via the Internet\u201d, which could apply to all kinds of data transmitted over the Internet.\n### III.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Sentencing of dangerous offenders\n##### 1. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 (\u201cthe 2003 Act\u201d)\n22. IPPs were introduced with effect from 4 April 2005 by section 225 of the 2003 Act. At the relevant time, section 225 applied where an adult was convicted of a serious offence and the sentencing court was of the opinion that there was significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by him of further specified offences. Unless a sentence of life imprisonment was appropriate, the court was required to impose a sentence of imprisonment for public protection.\n23. Section 225(4) defined a sentence of imprisonment for public protection as:\n\u201c... a sentence of imprisonment for an indeterminate period, subject to the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 as to the release of prisoners and duration of licences.\u201d\n##### 2. Amendments to the 2003 Act\n24. The consequence of the entry into force of the legislative provisions introducing IPP sentences was that a large number of individuals were sentenced to an IPP sentence. Although it had been intended that the new provisions would be resource-neutral, it soon became clear that existing resources were insufficient and the large number of IPP prisoners swamped the system in place for dealing with those serving indeterminate sentences (see James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, 18 September 2012 (not yet final) for further details).\n25. The 2003 Act was subsequently amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. In particular, IPP sentences are no longer mandatory. The new provisions apply to all sentences passed on or after 14 July 2008.\n#### B. Release of indeterminate sentence prisoners\n26. The Parole Board is responsible for the release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment and those serving indeterminate sentences for the public protection. Under section 28(5) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d), the Secretary of State is required to release a life or IPP prisoner who has served his tariff period if the Parole Board has directed his release. Section 28(6) provides that the Parole Board will not give a direction for release unless the Secretary of State has referred the prisoner\u2019s case to the Board; and the Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined. Section 28(7) provides that a life prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board at any time after tariff expiry.\n27.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The offence of insulting the President of France (offense) is provided for in section 26 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881, which reads as follows:\n\u201cInsulting the President of the Republic by one of the means set out in section 23 shall be punishable by a fine of 45,000 euros.\nThe penalties provided for in the preceding subsection shall be applicable to insults to a person exercising all or part of the powers of the President.\u201d\nAs in the case of the offence of insulting the head of State, the penalties provided for in sections 30 and 31 of the 1881 Act, which respectively concern damage to the honour and reputation of public authorities (State institutions and administrative authorities) and persons vested with public authority (such as ministry officials), are more severe than those applicable to defamation of private individuals. However, the penalty for the ordinary offence of proffering insults (injure) is the same irrespective of whether the insult was directed at a private individual or a public authority: section 33 of the 1881 Act provides that \u201cinsults proffered in the same manner to private individuals, without prior provocation, shall be punishable by a fine of 12,000 euros\u201d. In a decision of 16 July 2010 the Court of Cassation (Criminal Division, no. 10-90.081), which had been asked for a preliminary ruling on constitutionality in the context of proceedings brought under section 31 of the Act of 29 July 1881, held as follows in response to the question whether section 31 infringed the principle of equality in that it entailed a more severe penalty for defamation of a civil servant than for defamation of a private individual:\n\u201c... The question raised has no serious merit, seeing that firstly, the principle of equality does not prevent the law from being applied differently in different situations; secondly, although the fine applicable for public defamation of a civil servant is higher than that applicable for public defamation of a private individual, it serves as punishment, without being manifestly disproportionate, for the attack not only on the person at whom the offending remarks are directed but also on the function embodied by that person; and lastly, anyone prosecuted under section 31 of the Act of 29 July 1881 has the opportunity to prove that he or she acted in good faith.\nIt follows that it is unnecessary to refer the question to the Constitutional Council ...\u201d\n17. The rationale behind making it a criminal offence to insult the head of State is to protect the latter from certain forms of attack on his or her honour or dignity. The power to bring a prosecution for the offence is vested solely in the public prosecutor\u2019s office, acting of its own motion (section 47 of the Act of 29 July 1881). According to the Government\u2019s explanations, the offence of insulting the head of State, unlike that of criminal defamation and the ordinary offence of proffering insults, is aimed more at protecting the function than the person. It is described in the Act as an \u201coffence against the public good\u201d and is thus set apart from offences against persons, which explains why a prosec", "001-118335": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ABDI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Detention pending deportation\n35. The power to detain a person against whom a decision has been taken to make a deportation order is contained in Paragraph 2 (2) of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (\u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d), which provides:\n\u201cWhere notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section 105 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (notice of decision) of a decision to make a deportation order against him, and he is not detained in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending the making of the deportation order.\u201d\n36. The power to detain an individual in respect of whom a deportation order is in force is contained in Paragraph 2 (3) of Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act. It provides:\n\u201cWhere a deportation order is in force against any person, he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of State pending his removal or departure from the United Kingdom (and if already detained by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) or (2) above when the order is made, shall continue to be detained unless [he is released on bail or] the Secretary of State directs otherwise).\u201d\n37. There are, however, limitations on the power to detain. Four distinct principles emerge from the guidance given in R v Governor of Durham Prison, ex parte Hardial Singh [1984] WLR 704:\n\u201ci. The Secretary of State must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose;\nii. The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances;\niii. If, before the expiry of the reasonable period, it becomes apparent that the Secretary of State will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period, he should not seek to exercise the power of detention;\niv. The Secretary of State should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal.\u201d\n38. In the case of Walumba Lumba and Kadian Mighty v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 12, the Supreme Court briefly considered the Hardial Singh principles. In his leading judgment, which was accepted by the majority of the court, Lord Dyson found that in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the period of detention, the risk of re-offending would be a relevant factor. In this regard, he noted that if a person re-offended, there was a risk that he would abscond either to evade arrest or, if he was arrested and prosecuted, that he would receive a custodial sentence. Either way, his re-offending would impede his deportation. He also considered that the pursuit of legal challenges by the Foreign National Prisoner could be relevant. However, he considered the weight to be given to the time spent on appeals to be fact-sensitive. In this regard, he noted that much more weight should be given to detention during a period when the detained person was pursuing a meritorious appeal than to detention during a period when he was pursuing a hopeless one.\n39. Lord Dyson further noted that while it was common ground that the refusal to return voluntarily was relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness of the period of detention because a risk of absconding could be inferred from the refusal, he warned against the danger of drawing such an inference in every case. On the contrary, he considered it necessary to distinguish between cases where the return to the country of origin was possible and cases where it was not. Where return was not possible for reasons extraneous to the person detained, the fact that he was not willing to return voluntarily could not be held against him since his refusal had no causal effect.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The United Kingdom\n##### 1. General provisions on voting in parliamentary elections\n7. Section 1(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if on the date of the poll he is, inter alia, registered in the register of parliamentary electors for a constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Pursuant to section 4(1), a person is entitled to be registered if on the relevant date he is, inter alia, resident in the constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.\n##### 2. Provisions regarding persons with a service qualification\n8. Sections 14-17 of the 1983 Act allow certain categories of persons otherwise eligible to vote who do not fulfill the normal residence requirements to continue to register to vote by making a \u201cservice declaration\u201d. A service declaration can be made by a person who is (a) a member of the forces, (b) employed in the service of the Crown in a post outside the United Kingdom of any prescribed class or description, (c) employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom, or (d) the spouse or civil partner of a person falling within categories (a), (b) or (c) above.\n9. Section 17 provides that where a person\u2019s service declaration is in force, he shall be regarded for the purposes of section 4 of the 1983 Act as a resident on the date of the declaration at the address specified in it (current or former address in the United Kingdom).\n##### 3. Provisions regarding overseas voters\n(a) Current legislation\n10. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 as amended (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d) provides that a person who is a British citizen is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if he qualifies as an overseas elector on the date on which he makes an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d (see paragraph 14 below). A person qualifies as an overseas elector if he is not resident in the United Kingdom and he satisfies one of the sets of conditions set out in the legislation.\n11. The relevant set of conditions for the purpose of the present case is set out in section 1(3):\n\u201cThe first set of conditions is that\u2014\n(a) he was included in a register of parliamentary electors in respect of an address at a place that is situated within the constituency concerned,\n(b) that entry in the register was made on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at that address,\n(c) that entry in the register was in force at any time falling within the period of 15 years ending immediately before the relevant date [i.e. the date on which the applicant makes a declaration under section 2], and\n(d) subsequent to that entry ceasing to have effect no entry was made in any register of parliamentary electors on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at any other address.\u201d\n12. Section 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to be registered pursuant to an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d in the constituency where he was last registered to vote or last resided and the registration officer concerned is satisfied that he qualifies as an overseas elector in respect of that constituency. Where the entitlement of a person to remain registered as an overseas voter terminates, the registration officer concerned shall remove that person\u2019s entry from the register (section 2(2)).\n13. Section 2(3) requires that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration state the date of the declaration, that the declarant is a British citizen, that the declarant is not resident in the United Kingdom, and the date on which he ceased to be so resident.\n14. Section 2(4) stipulates that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration must show which set of conditions in section 1 of the Act the declarant claims to satisfy and, in the case of the first set of conditions, specify the address in respect of which he was registered.\n(b) History to the current legislation\n15. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 Act, no British citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary, i.e. general, election in the United Kingdom, other than members of the armed forces or Crown servants.\n16. In 1982 a parliamentary committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee, published a report on the Representation of the People Acts which recommended that British citizens living in what were then Member States of the European Economic Community should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period. The Government\u2019s response to that report recommended a seven-year limit for all overseas voters, expressing the view that a person\u2019s links with the United Kingdom were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for as long as ten years.\n17. The 1985 Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to British citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous five years. The bill originally proposed a seven-year period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short. Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time-limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with the United Kingdom were also raised.\n18. The five-year period was extended to twenty years by virtue of section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1989. The bill which led to the Act was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time-limit to twenty-five years. During parliamentary debates, the Secretary of State acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut-off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who, although resident abroad for some time, had retained close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and those who had \u201ccut adrift\u201d from such links much earlier. Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views, with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum.\n19. Section 1 of the 1989 Act was subsequently repealed and replaced, with retention of the twenty-year period, by section 8 and Schedule 2 of the Representation of the People Act 2000.\n20. In September 1998 the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on Electoral Law and Administration. It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced. The relevant extract of its report reads:\n\u201c113. The Representation of the People Act 1985 introduced a right for British citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and European elections for up to five years following their move overseas. This period was increased to twenty years under the Representation of the People Act 1989. The peak year for actual registrations under the Act was in 1991 when 34,500 registered; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in 1997, when the total stood at 23,600, followed by a further fall in 1998 to 17,300. Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged as high as three million.\n114. It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote. Professor Blackburn argued that the system meant that \u2018an expatriate living hundreds or thousands of miles away, for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation, carrying memories of British politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live, can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019. Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrat representatives both suggested that 20 years was perhaps too long. Professor Blackburn suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the UK or to an intention to return.\n115. On the other hand, it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue. It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the UK and are those most likely to be planning to return. A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home. The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be low", "001-119957": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF LEVENTO\u011eLU ABDULKAD\u0130RO\u011eLU v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n34. The Court refers to the Domestic law and Practice in its judgment in the case of McCaughey v. the United Kingdom (no. 43098/09, 16 July 2013). It repeats below the following aspects for ease of reference.\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n35. Section 35(3)-(5) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (amending the Prosecution of Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1972) provides as follows:\n\u201c(3) Where the circumstances of any death which has been, or is being, investigated by a coroner appear to the coroner to disclose that an offence may have been committed against the law of Northern Ireland or the law of any other country or territory, the coroner must as soon as practicable send to the Director a written report of the circumstances.\n#### B. Relevant jurisprudence\n36. In R v Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, Ex p Jamieson ([1995] QB 1, concerning England and Wales) the Court of Appeal ruled that \u201chow\u201d meant \u201cby what means\u201d, a question directed to how the deceased came by his death. While a verdict could properly incorporate a brief and neutral statement, the verdict was to be factual, expressing no judgment or opinion and it was not the jury\u2019s function to prepare detailed factual statements.\n37. In 2001-2003 the Court adopted six similar judgments concerning the investigation of killings by security forces in Northern Ireland (Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, McKerr v. the United Kingdom, Shanaghan v. the United Kingdom, and Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, all four cited above, as well as McShane v. the United Kingdom, no. 43290/98, 28 May 2002; and Finucane v. the United Kingdom, no. 29178/95, ECHR 2003\u2011VIII). A number of domestic judicial review applications followed.\n38. In the case of Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Amin ([2003] UKHL 51) the House of Lords ruled on the requirements of an Article 2 compliant investigation. In R (Middleton) \u03bd West Somerset Coroner ([2004] 2 A.C. 182) the House of Lords reviewed the scope of the Jamieson inquest and found that, since a Jamieson inquest could not examine whether the conduct of State agents might reasonably have prevented death, it was incompatible with Article 2. To comply with that Article, the inquest had to consider \u201cby what means\u201d and \u201cin what circumstances\u201d the deceased came by his death, so that the inquest verdict would be broader in scope.\n39. On 11 March 2004 the House of Lords found that there was no obligation to conduct an inquiry compatible with Article 2 when the death had occurred before the HRA came into force (In re McKerr ([2004] 1 W.L.R. 807).\n40. On 28 March 2007 the House of Lords delivered its judgment (Jordan v. Lord Chancellor and Another and McCaughey v. Chief Constable of the Police Service Northern Ireland [2007] UKHL 14). It relied on the McKerr judgment to the effect that the HRA did not apply to a pre-HRA death or, therefore, to the investigation of any such death. However, Section 8 of the 1959 Act plainly required the police to disclose to the Coroner such information about the deaths as the police was then or thereafter able to obtain, subject to any relevant privilege or immunity.\n41. In a later judicial review action, Hugh Jordan successfully contested a PSNI refusal to disclose to him all documents disclosed by it to the Coroner, except those to which valid professional privilege/immunity attached (In re Jordan\u2019s Application [2008] NIQB 148). The High Court\u2019s decision was informed by:\n\u201c... the confusion that has been created by the fragmented production of documents over the years. There has been duplication of some documents and a failure to produce certain documents on some occasions and then their production on other occasions. It has been acknowledged that the level of redactions have on occasions been excessive.\u201d\nAccordingly, the High Court ordered (section 8 of the 1959 Act) the PSNI to, inter alia, make a full and indexed disclosure to Hugh Jordan.\n42. In 2008 alone there were six judicial review applications as regards Pearse Jordan\u2019s inquest. In 2009 the Court of Appeal made the following comment about the delay in holding the inquest into Pearse Jordan\u2019s death (Hugh Jordan v. the Senior Coroner [2009] NICA 64):\n\u201cThis inquest has taken an extremely long time to reach this point and has been dogged by procedural wrangling, frequent judicial review applications and hearings in the House of Lords and Strasbourg all of which have contributed to the length and complexity of the inquest.\nThe current state of coronial law is extremely unsatisfactory. It is developing by means of piecemeal incremental case law. It is marked by an absence of clearly drafted and easily enforceable procedural rules. Its complexity, confusion and inadequacies make the function of a coroner extremely difficult and is called on to apply case law which does not always speak with one voice or consistently. One must sympathise with any coroner called on to deal with a contentious inquest of this nature which has become by its nature and background extremely adversarial. The problems are compounded by the fact that the [PSNI] which would normally be expected to assist a coroner in non contentious cases is itself a party which stands accused of wrong doing. It is not apparent that entirely satisfactory arrangements exist to enable the PSNI to dispassionately perform its functions of assisting the coroner when it has its own interests to further and protect. If nothing else, it is clear from this matter that Northern Ireland coronial law and practice requires a focused and clear review to ensure the avoidance of the procedural difficulties that have arisen in this inquest. What is also clear is that the proliferation of satellite litigation is extremely unsatisfactory and diverts attention from the main issues to be decided and contributes to delay.\u201d\n43. Further to the delivery of this Court\u2019s judgment in \u0160ilih v. Slovenia ([GC], no. 71463/01, 9 April 2009), the Supreme Court reversed McKerr and accepted that an inquest should be compliant with Article 2 even for a pre-HRA death (McCaughey and Another, Re Application for Judicial Review [2011] UKSC 20).\nTHE LAW\n44.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n18. Article 42 of the Turkish Constitution provides that no one may be deprived of the right to education.\n19. Section 10 of the 1981 Higher Education Act (Law no. 2547) states that the Student Selection and Placement Centre (\u00d6SYM) is a body which, under the principles set out by the Higher Education Council and for the purposes of selecting applicants for higher education courses, prepares tests, carries them out, assesses their results and, depending on the preferences expressed by successful candidates, ensures the latter\u2019s admission to universities and other institutions of higher education.\n20. The relevant parts of section 45 of the 1982 Higher Education Reform Act (Law no. 2547) reads as follows:\n\u201cStudents shall be admitted to institutions of higher education on passing a competitive examination, the rules on which shall be determined by the Higher Education Council. Regard shall be had in assessing the results of the examination to the average marks obtained by the students concerned at high school ...\u201d\n21. At the material time, the teaching in vocational high schools specialising in communication of fundamental subjects such as mathematics, the technical sciences (physics, chemistry and biology) and the social sciences (philosophy, literature, history and geography) had gradually decreased to the point of disappearing from the programme for the final two years of the cycle. These schools provided their students, particularly during the last two years of the cycle, with a programme which comprised courses on the various aspects of journalism and was very similar, in terms of both the form and the content of the courses, to the programmes run in the first year in faculties of communication sciences.\n22. In the appendix to its Recommendation no. R (98) 3 to member States on access to higher education, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe advised the governments and institutions of higher education as follows:\n\u201c2. Aims and objectives\n...\n2.1. All who are able and willing to participate successfully in higher education should have fair and equal opportunities to do so.\n...\n##### 4. Admissions\n...\n4.1. Admissions criteria and procedures should recognise the different starting points and cultural backgrounds of applicants, and seek to include all those with the potential to benefit.\n4.2. The range of access routes should be widened by extending admissions criteria to include alternatives to the conventional high school diploma. In particular:\n- high-level vocational qualifications should be accepted as appropriate preparation for higher education;\n- appropriate credit should be given to experiential learning;\n- applicants who are generally well-qualified but suffer from specific educational gaps should have opportunities to follow bridging courses, provided by higher or by further education.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

If a person sexually touches a child under 15 years of age otherwise than as previously provided for in this Chapter, or induces the child to undertake or participate in an act with sexual implications, a fine or imprisonment of a maximum period of two years shall be imposed for sexual molestation.\n2. A sentence for sexual molestation shall also be imposed on a person who by coercion, seduction or other improper influence induces a person who has attained the age of 15 but not 18 to undertake or participate in an act with sexual implications if the act is an element in the production of pornographic pictures or constitutes pornographic posing in circumstances other than those relating to the production of a picture.\n3. This shall also apply if a person exposes himself or herself in such a manner that the nature thereof gives offence or otherwise manifestly behaves indecently by word or deed towards a person in a way that flagrantly violates a sense of propriety.\u201d\n28. On 1 April 2005 that provision was incorporated into Article 10 of Chapter 6 and reads as follows:\n\u201c1. A person who, otherwise than as previously provided in this Chapter, sexually touches a child under 15 years of age or induces the child to undertake or participate in an act with sexual implications shall be sentenced for sexual molestation to a fine or to imprisonment of a maximum period of two years.\n2. This also applies to a person who exposes himself or herself to another person in a manner that is likely to cause discomfort or who otherwise by word or deed molests a person in a way that is likely to violate that person\u2019s sexual integrity.\u201d\n29. It should be noted that a person cannot be held responsible for an uncompleted act of sexual molestation, such as attempting or preparing to commit such a crime (see, by converse implication, Chapter 23, Article 1, of the Penal Code).\n30. Subsequently, based on the statements in the preparatory works to the provision, the 2008 Sexual Offences Commission stated the following.\n\u201cIn our view, it is ... quite clear that the second paragraph of the provision on sexual molestation should also include actions directed at persons who are unconscious or asleep. The provision therefore belongs to the category of sexual offences, not offences against integrity. Using this as the starting point for how the offence of sexual molestation should be handled, it may also be possible to assess situations in which a person has covertly filmed or photographed another person in a sexually intrusive way as sexual molestation.\u201d\n#### B. Attempted child pornography\n31. The relevant provisions of the Penal Code read:\nArticle 10a of Chapter 16 on crimes against public order\n\u201cA person who\n##### 1. portrays a child in a pornographic picture;\n2. disseminates, transfers, grants use of, exhibits, or in any other way makes such a picture of a child available to some other person;\n##### 3. acquires or offers such a picture of a child;\n4. brings about contact between a buyer and a seller of such pictures of children or takes any other similar step to facilitate dealing in such pictures; or\n##### 5. possesses such a picture of a child\nshall be sentenced for the crime of child pornography to imprisonment for a maximum period of two years, or, if it is a petty offence, to a fine or imprisonment for a maximum period of six months.\nA child is held to be a person whose pubertal development is not complete or who is under 18 years of age. If a person\u2019s pubertal development is complete, liability shall be imposed for deeds committed under points 2 to 5 above only if it is apparent from the picture or its circumstances that the depicted person is under 18 years of age.\n...\u201d\n32. Before 1 January 2011, the second paragraph of the above Article read:\n\u201cA child is held to be a person whose pubertal development is not complete or who, where this is apparent from the picture and its circumstances, is less than 18 years of age ...\u201d\n33. The term \u201cpornographic picture\u201d is not defined in the text of the law. In the preparatory works it was stated that the provision about pornographic crimes applied only to pictures, but to pictures of all kinds, such as, inter alia, pictures in publications, photographic pictures, including films and pictures distributed by TV-technique or video recordings (Governmental Bill 1978/79:179, p. 9). Moreover it was stated that:\n\u201cA certain prudence was called for, so that the criminalised area would not become too wide or difficult to assess. It was not the intention to criminalise every exposure of naked children or all pictures in which a child\u2019s genitals may be perceived, even if such pictures may stimulate some people\u2019s sexual instincts. In order for the handling of a picture to be illegal, it is a condition that it be pornographic according to common parlance and general values.\u201d\n34. In a review of the legislation (Law no. 2010:1357), which led to the amendment of the second paragraph of Chapter 16, Article 10a, as from 1 January 2011, as set out above, the following was stated, among other things, as regards the definition (Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2007:54, p. 77):\n\u201cA picture may be regarded as pornographic when, without any real scientific or artistic merits, and in a blatant and alluring manner, it displays a sexual motive (Gov. Bill 1970:125, pp. 79 et seq.). Not only do pictures in which children are involved in acts which obviously have a sexual connotation fall within the provision regarding child-pornography crimes, but also pictures in which children appear together with one or several adults who are performing such actions. Pictures in which a child appears in a manner which is designed to appeal to sexual instincts without the child being considered to have participated in sexual behaviour during the picturing may fall within the criminalised area ... A picture may be presented in different ways, inter alia, by a real child being pictured, filmed or drawn. By using different techniques, more or less realistic artificial pictures may also be created. For criminal liability to be incurred it is not necessary that the picture depicts a real child; pictures of fictive children are also included.\u201d\n35. With regard specifically to attempt, the Penal Code reads:\nChapter 16, Article 17\n\u201cA person preparing or conspiring to commit mutiny ... shall be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23. The same shall also apply ... to the crime of attempting to commit the crime of child pornography described in Article 10a, first paragraph ...\u201d\nChapter 23, Article 1\n\u201cA person who has begun to commit a crime without bringing it to completion shall, in cases where specific provisions exist for the purpose, be sentenced for attempting to commit a crime if there was a danger that the act would lead to the completion of the crime or such danger was precluded only because of fortuitous circumstances.\nPunishment for attempt shall not exceed the sentence applicable to a completed crime and shall not be less than imprisonment if the least stringent punishment for the completed crime is imprisonment of two years or more.\u201d\n#### C. Other relevant legal provisions\n36. The Code of Judicial Procedure (R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken 1942:740) provides in so far as relevant:\nChapter 17, Article 3\n\u201cA judgment shall not be given for anything other or more than that properly requested by a party. In cases amenable to out-of-court settlement, the judgment shall not be based on circumstances other than those pleaded by a party as the foundation of his or her action.\u201d\nChapter 22, Article 7\n\u201cIf an action for private claims in consequence of an offence is brought in conjunction with the prosecution and it is found that the offence charged is not punishable, the action may nonetheless be adjudicated in the case.\u201d\nChapter 29, Article 6\n\u201c...Where a private claim is joined to the prosecution, the court\u2019s finding of criminal liability shall be binding for the adjudication of the private claim.\u201d\nChapter 30, Article 3\n\u201cThe judgment may relate only to an act for which a prosecution was properly instituted or to a matter referred by statute to the court\u2019s criminal jurisdiction. The court is not bound by the legal characterisation of the offence or applicable provisions of law stated in the claim.\u201d\n37. The Tort Liability Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslag 1972:207) provides in so far as relevant:\nChapter 2, section 1\n\u201cAnyone who deliberately or negligently causes personal injury or damage to property shall compensate the injury or damage caused.\u201d\nChapter 2, section 3\n\u201cAnyone who seriously violates another person through a crime involving an attack against the person or the freedom, serenity or honour of that person shall compensate the damage caused by the violation.\u201d\n#### D. Domestic practice concerning covert filming\n38. In a Supreme Court judgment of 16 October 1992 (NJA 1992, p. 594) concerning a person who had secretly filmed sexual intercourse between himself and his girlfriend and who had subsequently shown the film to several persons, the Supreme Court noted that it was not prohibited under Swedish law to film another person without his or her consent. This was so, the court continued, even in situations where the deed in question seriously violated the personal integrity of the person concerned. Apart from certain exceptional situations, the only protection available was under the criminal provisions on defamation in conjunction with Chapter 1, section 3", "001-138892": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF TANBAY T\u00dcTEN v.

No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. ...\n3(1) Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.\n(2) The constitution, powers, jurisdiction and procedure of such special courts shall be prescribed by law. ...\u201d\n#### B. The Offences Against the State Act 1939, as amended (\u201c1939 Act\u201d)\n38. The Court refers to the description of the matters leading to the adoption of the 1939 Act in its judgment in Lawless v. Ireland ((no. 3), 1 July 1961, \u00a7\u00a7 1-7, Series A no. 3). The 1939 Act allowed for the establishment of the Special Criminal Court (\u201cSCC\u201d, section 38) to try offences not amenable to trial in the ordinary courts. The SCC remains in being as long as the Government proclamation is in force and can be re-established at any time by proclamation. Unlike the ordinary criminal courts, the SCC is a non-jury court comprised of three judges from the ordinary courts.\n39. Section 21(1) of the 1939 Act prohibits membership of an unlawful organisation. The Irish Republican Army (\u201cIRA\u201d) was declared unlawful by a suppression order pursuant to section 19 of the 1939 Act. In 1983 a suppression order prohibited the Irish National Liberation Army (\u201cINLA\u201d).\n40. Section 36 of the 1939 Act allows for certain scheduled offences to be tried before the SCC. The Offences Against the State (Scheduled Offences) Order 1972 defined scheduled offences and includes the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.\n#### C. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972, as amended (\u201cthe 1972 Act\u201d)\n41. Section 3 of the 1972 Act, entitled \u201cEvidence of membership of unlawful organisation\u201d, reads as follows:\n\u201c3(1)(a) Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member.\n(b) In paragraph (a) of this subsection \u2018conduct\u2019 includes-\n(i) movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused person, and\n(ii) omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.\n(2) Where an officer of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence under the said section 21, states that he believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member..\u201d\n#### D. The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1998 Act\u201d)\n42. Section 2 of the 1998 Act is headed \u2018Membership of an unlawful organisation: inferences that may be drawn\u201d and provides:\n\u201c2. (1) Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence under section 21 of the Act of 1939 evidence is given that the accused at any time before he or she was charged with the offence, on being questioned by a member of the [police] in relation to the offence, failed to answer any question material to the investigation of the offence, then the court in determining whether to send forward the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer and the court ... in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of such inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence in relation to the offence, but a person shall not be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.\n(2) Subsection (1) shall not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language when being questioned what the effect of such a failure might be.\u201d\n#### E. Relevant judicial dicta\n##### 1. O\u2019Leary v. the Attorney General [1993] 1 I.R. 102\n43. In this case the High Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of section 3(2) of the 1972 Act and, in so doing, it noted:\n\u201cWhat this section does is to make admissible in evidence in certain trials statements of belief which would otherwise be inadmissible. The statement of belief it proffered at the trial becomes \u201cevidence\u201d by virtue of this section in the prosecution case against the accused. Like other evidence it has to be weighed and considered and the section cannot be construed as meaning that the court of trial must convict the accused in the absence of exculpatory evidence. The accused need not give evidence and he may ask the court to hold that the evidence does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that he is a member of an unlawful organisation. Should the court agree he must be acquitted.\u201d\n##### 2. DPP v. Ward [1999] 1 I.R. 60\n44. The Supreme Court held in this case that informer privilege was of ancient origin and was essential for the prevention and detection of crime. The privilege was subject only to the \u2018innocence at stake\u2019 exception. Members of a trial court, it held, had full discretion to decide how a trial was to be conducted and, in particular, how an issue with regard to the question of privilege was to be decided. Although not mandatory, it was within the discretion of a trial court as to whether or not it should review documentation over which privilege is asserted - the court being required to balance, on the one hand, the public interest in prosecuting serious crime and protecting confidentiality and, on the other, the fair trial rights of an accused.\n##### 3.

The appeal in the present applicant\u2019s case before the CCA was adjourned pending the delivery of the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the above-cited case of DPP v. Kelly. In that case, the Supreme Court dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim that the restrictions on his ability to cross-examine the Chief Superintendent giving belief evidence violated his right to a fair trial.\n46.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The State Immunity Act 1978\n39. Part I of the State Immunity Act 1978 deals with the extent of State immunity in civil proceedings. Section 1 provides:\n\u201c(1) A State is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom except as provided in the following provisions of this Part of the Act.\n(2) A court shall give effect to the immunity conferred by this section even though the State does not appear in the proceedings in question.\u201d\n40. The remainder of Part I of the Act identifies exceptions from immunity including: submission to the jurisdiction (section 2); commercial transactions and contracts to be performed in the United Kingdom (section 3); contracts of employment (section 4); personal injuries and damage to property \u201ccaused by an act or omission in the United Kingdom\u201d (section 5); ownership, possession and use of property (section 6); patents and trade marks (section 7); membership of bodies corporate (section 8); arbitrations (section 9); ships used for commercial purposes (section 10); and value-added tax and customs duties (section 11).\n41. Section 14 provides:\n\u201c(1) The immunities and privileges conferred by this Part of this Act apply to any foreign or commonwealth State other than the United Kingdom; and references to a State include references to\u2013\n(a) the sovereign or other head of that State in his public capacity;\n(b) the government of that State; and\n(c) any department of that government,\nbut not to any entity (hereafter referred to as a \u2018separate entity\u2019) which is distinct from the executive organs of the government of the State and capable of suing or being sued.\n(2) A separate entity is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom if, and only if\u2013\n(a) the proceedings relate to anything done by it in the exercise of sovereign authority; and\n(b) the circumstances are such that a State ... would have been so immune.\u201d\n#### B. Propend Finance Pty Ltd v. Sing and another (1997) 111 ILR 611 (\u201cPropend\u201d)\n42. In Propend, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales considered the application of the State Immunity Act 1978 to the Head of the Australian Federal Police. The court considered that the defendant benefited from State immunity, explaining:\n\u201cThe protection afforded by the Act of 1978 to States would be undermined if employees [or] officers ... could be sued as individuals for matters of State conduct in respect of which the State they were serving had immunity. Section 14(1) must be read as affording to individual employees or officers of the foreign State protection under the same cloak as protects the State itself.\u201d\n43. The court observed that this proposition had wide support in Commonwealth and foreign jurisdictions, citing German, Canadian and US cases.\n#### C. Regina v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate and Others, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 3) [2000] 1 AC 147 (\u201cPinochet (No. 3)\u201d)\n44. Pinochet (No. 3) concerned a request by Spain for the extradition of Senator Augusto Pinochet from the United Kingdom to stand trial for crimes, including torture, committed primarily in Chile while he was Head of State there. Senator Pinochet and the government of Chile argued that the Senator enjoyed immunity ratione materiae in respect of the alleged offences. The House of Lords handed down its judgment in March 1999 and held unanimously that the respondent did not benefit from immunity from prosecution in respect of the torture charges.\n45. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that if the respondent was not entitled to immunity in relation to the acts of torture, it would be the first time that a local domestic court had refused to afford immunity to a former Head of State on the grounds that there could be no immunity against prosecution for certain international crimes. He explained that the adoption of the Convention against Torture was intended to provide for an international system under which the torturer could find no safe haven. He noted the following points of importance: (1) \u201ctorture\u201d in this context could only be committed by a public official or other person acting in an official capacity, which included a Head of State; (2) superior orders provided no defence; (3) there was universal criminal jurisdiction; (4) there was no express provision dealing with State immunity; and (5) Chile, Spain and the United Kingdom were all parties to the Convention and were therefore bound by its provisions.\n46. Turning to the facts of the case, he said:\n\u201cThe question then which has to be answered is whether the alleged organisation of state torture by Senator Pinochet (if proved) would constitute an act committed by Senator Pinochet as part of his official functions as head of state. It is not enough to say that it cannot be part of the functions of the head of state to commit a crime. Actions which are criminal under the local law can still have been done officially and therefore give rise to immunity ratione materiae. The case needs to be analysed more closely.\u201d\n47. He was of the view that there was strong ground for saying that the implementation of torture as defined in the Convention against Torture could not be a State function, although he had doubts whether, before the entry into force of the Convention against Torture, the existence of the international crime of torture as jus cogens was enough to justify the conclusion that the organisation of State torture could not constitute the performance of an official function for immunity purposes. He continued:\n\u201c... Not until there was some form of universal jurisdiction for the punishment of the crime of torture could it really be talked about as a fully constituted international crime. But in my judgment the Torture Convention did provide what was missing: a worldwide universal jurisdiction. Further, it required all member states to ban and outlaw torture: Article 2. How can it be for international law purposes an official function to do something which international law itself prohibits and criminalises?\u201d\n48. Lord Browne-Wilkinson considered that if the implementation of a torture regime was a public function giving rise to immunity ratione materiae, this produced bizarre results. Since such immunity extended to all State officials involved in carrying out the functions of the State, and since the international crime of torture under the Convention against Torture can only be committed by an official or someone in an official capacity, all perpetrators of torture would be entitled to immunity. It would follow that there could be no case outside Chile in which a successful prosecution against the respondent for torture could be brought unless Chile were prepared to waive immunity. He concluded:\n\u201c... Therefore the whole elaborate structure of universal jurisdiction over torture committed by officials is rendered abortive and one of the main objectives of the Torture Convention \u2013 to provide a system under which there is no safe haven for torturers \u2013 will have been frustrated. In my judgment all these factors together demonstrate that the notion of continued immunity for ex-heads of state is inconsistent with the provisions of the Torture Convention.\u201d\n49. Lord Hope of Craighead addressed the question whether the concept of official functions included acts of the kind alleged in the case, which were not private acts but acts done in the exercise of State authority. He said:\n\u201c... I consider that the answer to it is well settled in customary international law. The test is whether they were private acts on the one hand or governmental acts done in the exercise of his authority as head of state on the other. It is whether the act was done to promote the state\u2019s interests \u2013 whether it was done for his own benefit or gratification or was done for the state ... The fact that acts done for the state have involved conduct which is criminal does not remove the immunity ...\nIt may be said that it is not one of the functions of a head of state to commit acts which are criminal according to the laws and constitution of his own state or which customary international law regards as criminal. But I consider that this approach to the question is unsound in principle. The principle of immunity ratione materiae protects all acts which the head of state has performed in the exercise of the functions of government. The purpose for which they were performed protects these acts from any further analysis. There are only two exceptions to this approach which customary international law has recognised. The first relates to criminal acts which the head of state did under the colour of his authority as head of state but which were in reality for his own pleasure or benefit ... The second relates to acts the prohibition of which has acquired the status under international law of jus cogens ...\u201d\n50. Lord Hope concluded that following the adoption of the Convention against Torture, it was no longer open to any State that was a signatory to it to invoke immunity ratione materiae in the event of allegations of systemic or widespread torture, which amounted to an international crime, committed after that date. He explained:\n\u201cI would not regard this as a case of waiver. Nor would I accept that it was an implied term of the Torture Convention that former heads of State were to be deprived of their immunity ratione materiae with respect to all acts of official torture as defined in article 1. It is just that the obligations which were recognised by customary international law in the case of such serious international crimes by the date when Chile ratified the Convention are so strong as to override any objection by it on the ground of immunity ratione materiae to the exercise of the jurisdiction over crimes committed after that date which the United Kingdom had made available.\u201d\n51. Lord Hutton concluded that the clear intent of the Convention against Torture was that an official of one State who had committed torture should be prosecuted if present in another State. He therefore considered that the respondent could not claim that the commission of acts of torture after the Convention\u2019s entry into force were functions of the Head of State. While the alleged acts of torture by the respondent were carried out under the colour of his position as Head of State, they could not be regarded as functions of a Head of State under international law when international law expressly prohibited torture as a measure which a State could employ in any circumstances whatsoever and had made it an international crime.\n52. Lord Saville of Newdigate agreed that, after the entry into force of the Convention against Torture, State immunity ratione materiae for acts of torture could not exist consistently with its terms. It therefore followed that an agreement to an exception to the general rule of State immunity ratione materiae existed between Spain, Chile and the United Kingdom from the date on which the three States became party to that Convention.\n53. Lord Millett held that the definition of torture in the Convention against Torture was entirely inconsistent with the existence of a plea of immunity ratione materiae. He concluded:\n\u201c... [T]he Republic of Chile was a party to the Torture Convention, and must be taken to have assented to the imposition of an obligation on foreign national courts to take and exercise criminal jurisdiction in respect of the official use of torture. I do not regard it as having thereby waived its immunity. In my opinion there was no immunity to be waived. The offence is one which could only be committed in circumstances which would normally give rise to the immunity. The international community had created an offence for which immunity ratione materiae could not possibly be available. International law cannot be supposed to have established a crime having the character of a jus cogens and at the same time to have provided an immunity which is co-extensive with the obligation it seeks to impose.\u201d\n54. He saw a difference between civil and criminal proceedings, explaining:\n\u201c... I see nothing illogical or contrary to public policy in denying the victims of state sponsored torture the right to sue the offending state in a foreign court while at the same time permitting (and indeed requiring) other states to convict and punish the individuals responsible if the offending state declines to take action. This was the very object of the Torture Convention. It is important to emphasise that Senator Pinochet is not alleged to be criminally liable because he was head of state when other responsible officials employed torture to maintain him in power. He is not alleged to be vicariously liable for the wrongdoing of his subordinates. He is alleged to have incurred direct criminal responsibility for his own acts in ordering and directing a campaign of terror involving the use of torture ...\u201d\n55. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers also commented that the principles of the law of immunity that applied to civil litigation would not necessarily apply to a criminal prosecution. He said that had the Pinochet proceedings been civil in nature, Chile could have argued that it was indirectly impleaded; but that argument did not run where the proceedings were criminal and where the issue was the respondent\u2019s personal responsibility, not that of Chile. On the question posed in this case, Lord Phillips, like Lord Saville, considered that State immunity ratione materiae could not coexist with the notion of international crimes. Since, in the case of torture, the only conduct covered by the Convention against Torture was conduct which would be subject to immunity ratione materiae if it applied, the Convention was incompatible with the applicability of such immunity.\n56. Lord Goff of Chieveley, dissenting, considered it clear that if State immunity in respect of torture was excluded in the case, then it could only have been done by the Convention against Torture itself. He did not consider that the well-established principle that a State\u2019s waiver of immunity had to be express could be circumvented by finding that torture did not form part of the functions of a State and that no immunity ratione materiae therefore applied to such acts. He highlighted that there was no evidence of any consideration being given to a waiver of State immunity in the negotiations leading to the Convention against Torture. He further pointed out that if immunity ratione materiae were excluded, former heads of State and senior public officials would have to think twice about travelling abroad, for fear of being the subject of unfounded allegations", "001-140015": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF LILLO-STENBERG AND S\u00c6THER v.

If there is more than one authorised representative, only one of them need be notified. If persons who are authorised to receive the notification are not present at the office of the legal entity for any reason or are not available to receive the notice at that time, the notification must be served on the officer or employee who is present at the office of the legal entity.\n29. Under Article 274 \u00a7 2 of the Commercial Code, in force at the material time, the Ministry of Industry and Trade could bring an action for the dissolution of any company proven to be responsible for acts and operations that were against law, public order and its articles of association, without prejudice to the provisions of private laws.\nTHE LAW\n### I. VICTIM STATUS OF THE FIRST APPLICANT\n30. At the outset the Court notes that, in the instant case, the parties to the domestic proceedings were Mesopotamia Publishing and the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The first applicant, even though he became director general of the company on 24 December 2001, was not a party to those proceedings, and the contested decision concerned the applicant company rather than the first applicant as a private individual. In this connection, the Court further observes that, since both in the application form and the subsequent observations submitted to the Court the applicants\u2019 complaints centred essentially on the dissolution of the company, the first applicant has not been shown to have been subjected to any separate or further interference with his rights (see, Kaya and Diri v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Primary education in Ireland\n##### 1. Background\n49. The Court refers to the description of the history and structure of the national-schools system of primary education provided by the Supreme Court in O\u2019Keeffe v. Hickey, ([2008] IESC 72) and, notably, by Hardiman J and Fennelly J (see paragraphs 30-35 and 42\u201144 above).\n50. Section 4 of the School Attendance Act 1926 required parents to ensure their children attended a national school or another suitable school, unless there was a reasonable excuse for not so doing, for example if the child was receiving suitable primary education elsewhere, if there was no national school accessible to which the parent did not object on religious grounds, or if the child was prevented from attending by some other sufficient cause. Attendance in full-time education was therefore compulsory for all children between 6 and 14 years of age until 1969 when the official school-leaving age was increased to 16. Primary education has been universally free in Ireland since the nineteenth century.\n51. The vast majority of children attending primary school attended \u201cnational schools\u201d which are State-financed and denominational primary-education establishments. Department reports for 1972/73 and 1973/74 recorded the existence of 3,776 and 3,688 national schools, respectively. The Department\u2019s statistical report for February 1973 indicated that 94% of primary schools were national schools. According to the 1965 Investment in Education Report, 91% of national schools were Catholic-run and catered for 97.6% of national-school pupils while 9% were Protestant-run, catering for 2.4% of such pupils. A 2011 report by the Department notes that approximately 96% of primary schools remained under denominational patronage and management (including 89.65% under Catholic patronage and management).\n52. In 1963/64 there were 192 fee-paying non-State-aided primary schools for approximately 21,000 children which represented about 4 to 4.5% of all primary-school pupils. The vast majority of these schools were in urban areas, the great majority of which were in Dublin.\n53. The \u201cCommission on School Accommodation\u2019s Report on the Revised Criteria for the Establishment of New Primary Schools\u201d in February 2011 confirmed that, until the 1970s, the only choice effectively available to parents was the local national school. It considered that by the end of the 1970s there was evidence of change with the establishment in 1978 of the first multi-denominational school and a growth in Irish language inter-denominational and multi-denominational schools.\n##### 2. The 1937 Constitution\n54. Article 42 is entitled \u201cEducation\u201d and reads as follows:\n\u201c1. The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.\n2. Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.\n3. (1) The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.\n(2) The State shall, however, as guardian of the common good, require in view of actual conditions that the children receive a certain minimum education, moral, intellectual and social.\n4. The State shall provide for free primary education and shall endeavour to supplement and give reasonable aid to private and corporate educational initiative, and, when the public good requires it, provide other educational facilities or institutions with due regard, however, for the rights of parents, especially in the matter of religious and moral formation.\n5. In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.\u201d\n55. In McEneaney v. the Minister for Education ([1941] IR 430), the Supreme Court observed that for \u201cmore than a century it has been recognised that the provision of primary education is a national obligation\u201d. Article 42 \u00a7 4) conferred on children a right to receive free primary education and the words \u201cprovide for\u201d meant that the State did not itself have to educate children but rather had to ensure that appropriate education was provided to them (Crowley v. Ireland [1980] IR 102).\n##### 3. Relevant legislation\n56. The Children Act 1908 governed child protection and contemplated State intervention in the form of taking a child into care in cases of inter-familial abuse. The Education Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d) was the first comprehensive legislation on education since the foundation of the State. It put on a statutory basis the State-funded and privately managed nature of primary education, making no fundamental structural changes thereto.\n4. Rules for national schools (\u201cthe 1965 Rules\u201d) and relevant ministerial circulars\n57. Rules in place before independence in 1922 were applied to national schools until the 1965 Rules were adopted by the Department. While the 1965 Rules were neither primary nor secondary legislation, they have legal force and form part of the relevant statutory regime (Brown v. Board of management of Rathfarnham Parish national school and Others ([2006] IEHC 178). Otherwise, the Department regulated matters within its remit by notes, circulars and other official Department instruments. The Minister could withdraw recognition from a school or withdraw an individual teacher\u2019s licence if the 1965 Rules were not complied with (Rules 30 and 108 of the 1965 Rules, respectively).\n##### 5. Managers and boards of management\n58. Rule 15 of the 1965 Rules provided that the manager was charged with the direct government of the school, the appointment of the teachers and, subject to the Minister\u2019s approval, their removal. A manager was to visit a school and ensure the 1965 Rules were complied with (Rule 16). Subject to the authority of the manager, the principal was responsible for discipline, the control of the other members of the teaching staff and all other matters connected with school arrangements (Rule 123(4)).\n59. Rule 121 set out rules for teachers\u2019 conduct: they had to, inter alia, act in a spirit of obedience to the law; pay the strictest attention to the morals and general conduct of their pupils; take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of their pupils; and carry out all lawful instructions issued by the manager. Rule 130 required teachers to have a lively regard for the improvement and general welfare of their pupils, to treat them with kindness, combined with firmness, and to govern them through their affections and reason and not by harshness and severity.\n60. Most primary schools now have boards of management. A ministerial circular (16/76) set out arrangements until the 1998 Act put the boards on a statutory basis. Section 14 of that Act provides that it is the duty of the patron to appoint, where practicable and in accordance with the \u201cprinciple of partnership\u201d, a board the composition of which is agreed between the Minister and the education partners. As bodies corporate with perpetual succession, the boards could sue and be sued.\n##### 6. Inspectors\n61. The 1965 Rules envisaged that the Minister and persons authorised by him (inspectors) could visit and examine the schools whenever they thought fit (Rule 11). Rule 161 defined inspectors as being agents of the Minister required to supply the Minister with such local information as he or she might require for the effective administration of the system. They were required to call the attention of managers and teachers to any rules which appeared to them to be being infringed. They were entitled to communicate with the manager with reference to the general condition of the school \u201cor to matters requiring the manager\u2019s attention, making such suggestions as they may deem necessary\u201d. An inspector was required to pay frequent incidental visits to the schools in his district and to make obligatory annual visits to assess the work of teachers. Circular 16/59 provided guidance to inspectors as to their role vis-\u00e0-vis managers and teachers, as to the manner in which incidental and general inspections were to be carried out and as regards their assessment of the work of teachers.\n##### 7. Complaints\n62. A Guidance Note of 6 May 1970 outlined the practice to be followed as regards complaints against teachers. The complainant was to be informed that the matter was one for the manager, in the first instance, and asked to clarify whether the complaint had been notified to the manager. The manager had to obtain observations from the relevant teacher and to forward those observations, together with the manager\u2019s own views, to the Department. The Deputy Chief Inspector within the Department would then identify whether an investigation was required. If so, the inspector was to interview the manager, the teacher and parents. If an inquiry led to relevant findings against the teacher, Rule 108 authorised the Minister to take action against a teacher if the latter had conducted him or herself improperly or failed or refused to comply with the 1965 Rules. The Minister could pursue the teacher\u2019s prosecution, withdraw recognition and/or withdraw or reduce the teacher\u2019s salary. As noted above, the manager could dismiss a teacher, subject to the Minister\u2019s approval.\n#### B. Criminal law and related matters\n63. The sexual abuse of a minor was prohibited by sections 50 and 51 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (as amended). The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 (\u201cthe 1935 Act\u201d) was designed to make further provision for the protection of young girls and to amend the law concerning sexual offences. Sections 1 and 2 of the 1935 Act created the offences of defilement of girls under 15 years of age and of girls between 15 and 17 years of age. Section 14 of the 1935 Act also provides:\n\u201cIt shall not be a defence to a charge of indecent assault upon a person under the age of fifteen years to prove that such person consented to the act alleged to constitute such indecent assault.\u201d\nConsequently, any girl under 15 years of age cannot consent to any form of sexual contact and any such contact was (and still is) a crime. In addition to these statutory offences, these acts amounted to ordinary assault.\n64. There was no limitation period applicable to indictable offences in Ireland so that an offender could be prosecuted until the end of his or her life.\n65. A victim can apply for compensation for injury suffered as a result of violent crime under the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. The Scheme is administered by the CICT. The prescription period is three months, but it can be extended. The initial decision is taken without a hearing and a hearing is held in private before a division of the CICT. The appeal decision is final. Compensation is paid on an ex gratia basis. It covers expenses and losses (out-of-pocket expenses and bills less social welfare payments, salary or wages received while on sick leave) and, until 1986, non-pecuniary loss.\n#### C. Civil law and related matters\n66. A tort is a civil wrong which causes someone to suffer loss resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act, the tortfeasor. The tort of negligence requires proof that there was a duty of care between the plaintiff and the defendant (which involves establishing the existence of a relationship of proximity between the parties such as would call for the exercise of care by one party towards the other), that that duty was breached and that that breach was causative of damage (for example, Beatty v. The Rent Tribunal [2005] IESC 66).\n67. Vicarious liability is the attribution of liability to a person or entity who did not cause injury and who may not be at fault but who has a particular legal relationship to the person who did cause the injury, and who himself was at fault, including through negligence. Legal relationships that can lead to vicarious liability include the relationship of employer and employee.\n68. It is also possible to rely on the Constitution to seek redress against an individual for a breach of one\u2019s constitutional rights. In Meskell v. CIE [1973] IR 121), the court stated:\n\u201c... if a person has suffered damage by virtue of a breach of a constitutional right or the infringement of a constitutional right that person is entitled to seek redress against the person or persons who have infringed that right.\u201d\nSuch a resort to constitutionally created torts only occurs if there is a gap in existing tort law which needs to be supplemented.\n#### D. Relevant public investigations and child-protection developments\n##### 1. The Carrigan Report 1931\n69. The Carrigan Committee was appointed in 1930 to consider whether certain criminal statutes needed amendments and to make proposals to deal with \u201cthe problem of juvenile prostitution\u201d. It held seventeen sittings, heard twenty-nine witnesses and considered other written submissions.\n70. On 20 August 1931 the Committee submitted its final report to the Minister for Justice. The report recommended a combination of social and legislative reforms as regards, inter alia, sexual crimes against minors.\n71. The Police Commissioner was an important witness before the Committee. Prior to appearing, he submitted statistical information he had gleaned from responses to a circular issued by him to over 800 police stations about the prosecution of sexual offences from 1924 to 1930 including for the offences of \u201cdefilement, carnal knowledge or rape\u201d of girls under 10 years of age, between 10 and 13, between 13 and 16, between 16 and 18 and over 18 years of age. He submitted a detailed analysis of those statistics noting, inter alia, that there was an \u201calarming amount of sexual crime increasing yearly, a feature of which was the large number of cases of criminal interference with girls and children from 16 years downwards, including many cases of children under 10 years of age\u201d. He was of the opinion that less than 15% of sexual crime was prosecuted for various reasons including the reluctance of parents to pursue matters for various reasons.\n72. On the advice of the Department of Justice (in a memorandum accompanying the report), neither the evidence before, nor the report of, the Carrigan Committee was published. In so advising, the Department of Justice criticised the report in several respects and noted that the obvious conclusion to be drawn from it was that the ordinary feelings of decency and the influence of religion had failed in Ireland and that the only remedy was by way of police action. The debate on the report took place in a parliamentary committee. Several recommendations were implemented including the adoption of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 (see paragraph 63 above). The Department of Justice\u2019s files on this report were published in 1991. Further archival material was released in 1999.\n##### 2. Reformatory and industrial schools\n73. Reformatory schools were established in the 1850s and industrial schools in the 1860s. These schools were mainly denominational and State-funded. The former received young offenders but there were never more than a few of such schools. However, there were fifty or so industrial schools which were schools for the training of children: children were lodged, clothed and fed as well as taught (section 44 of the Children Act 1908). From 1936 to 1970, a total of 170,000 children and young persons (involving about 1.2% of the relevant age group) entered industrial schools. The average stay was approximately seven years. The great majority of children were committed to industrial schools because they were \u201cneedy\u201d and the next most frequent grounds of entry were involvement in a criminal offence or non-attendance at school. Each of these grounds involved committal by the District Court. Section 7 of the Rules and Regulations for Industrial Schools 1933 provided that children\u2019s literary instruction would be in accordance with the national-schools programme and set down recommended hours for both literary instruction and industrial training.\n##### 3. The Cussen and Kennedy Reports on reformatory and industrial schools\n74. The Cussen Report, published in 1936, was commissioned by the State into the running of reformatory and industrial schools. The report endorsed the system contingent on its implementing fifty-one conclusions and recommendations. The system continued largely unchanged until a later committee, set up by the State and chaired by Justice Eileen Kennedy, surveyed these schools. The Kennedy Report was published in 1970, when the reformatory and industrial school system was already in decline. The closure of certain schools was recommended and other proposals for change were made. It found, notably, that the system of inspection had been totally ineffective and it recommended, together with other reporting mechanisms, the establishment of an independent statutory body to ensure the highest standards of child care and to act, inter alia, as a watchdog.\n##### 4. The Ryan Report on reformatory and industrial schools\n75. Following public disclosures and controversies in the late 1980s and early 1990s about, notably, clerical child abuse in Ireland, the Prime Minister issued the following written statement on 11 May 1999:\n\u201cOn behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue.\u201d\n76. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 was adopted (amended in 2005). A Commission (later known as the Ryan Commission) investigated and reported on child abuse (including sexual abuse) primarily in reformatory and industrial schools. Since there were relatively few reformatory schools, the Commission\u2019s work principally concerned industrial schools.\n77. The Commission\u2019s mandate mainly covered the 1930s to 1970s, the period between the Cussen and Kennedy Reports. Evidence was collected over a period of nine years and included voluminous documentation, expert evidence and the testimony of around 1,500 complainants. The \u201cInvestigation Committee\u201d heard evidence from witnesses who wished to have their allegations investigated whereas the \u201cConfidential Committee\u201d provided a private forum for witnesses to recount abuse suffered by them. The evidence to the latter committee was therefore unchallenged.\n78. The Commission reported in May 2009 (\u201cthe Ryan Report\u201d). It found that there had been widespread, chronic and severe physical, including sexual, abuse of children mainly by clergy in the reformatory and industrial schools.

Pursuant to Article 155 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, criminal investigations and related decisions concern only the accused and the charges brought against him or her. Article 264 \u00a7 1 stipulates that a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings shall deal with the offence set out in the bill of indictment as determined in more detail in the light of the outcome of the trial.\n25.

The examination must not be replaced by reading out the record of a previous examination of such witness or by his or her written statement.\n26. Pursuant to Article 337 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an appeal on points of law (Revision) against the judgment of a criminal court may only be lodged on the ground that the judgment was based on a breach of law.\n#### B. The Federal Constitutional Court Act\n27. The relevant provisions of the Federal Constitutional Court Act (Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz) read as follows:\nSection 90\n(1) Any person who claims that one of his basic rights or one of his rights under Articles 20 (4), 33, 38, 101, 103 and 104 of the Basic Law has been violated by a public authority may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court.\n(2) If legal action against the violation is admissible, the constitutional complaint may not be lodged until all remedies have been exhausted. However, the Federal Constitutional Court may decide immediately on a constitutional complaint lodged before all remedies have been exhausted if it is of general relevance or if recourse to other courts first would entail a serious and unavoidable disadvantage for the complainant.\n...\nSection 93a\n(1) A complaint of unconstitutionality shall require acceptance prior to a decision.\n(2) It shall be accepted\n(a) if it raises a constitutional issue of fundamental significance,\n(b) if this is advisable for securing the rights referred to in section 90(1); or also in the event that the denial of a decision on the matter would entail a particularly serious disadvantage for the complainant.\u201d\n#### C. The principle of presumption of innocence\n28. According to the established case-law of the German Federal Constitutional Court (see, for instance, BVerfGE 74, 358, 370 et seq. and 82, 106, 114 et seq.), the principle of being presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law derives from the principle of the rule of law, and in interpreting its content and scope regard must be had to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. The principle of the presumption of innocence is closely linked to the right of a person charged with a criminal offence to defend him or herself in the course of a fair trial. By virtue of that principle, no measures effectively amounting to a penalty may be taken against a defendant without his guilt having been established beforehand at a proper trial. The principle further requires that guilt be proved according to law before it can be held against the person concerned. A finding of guilt will accordingly not be legitimate for this purpose unless it is pronounc", "001-142423": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF SCHATSCHASCHWILI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n40. Article 160 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that as soon as the public prosecution authorities obtain knowledge of a suspected criminal offence either through a criminal complaint or by other means they shall investigate the facts with a view to deciding whether public charges are to be preferred. The public prosecution authorities shall ascertain not only incriminating but also exonerating circumstances, and shall ensure that evidence, the loss of which is to be feared, is taken.\n41. Pursuant to Article 168 (c) (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecutor, the accused and defence counsel shall be permitted to be present during the judicial examination of a witness or expert prior to the opening of the main proceedings. The judge may exclude an accused from being present at the hearing if his presence would endanger the purpose of the investigation, in particular if it is to be feared that a witness will not tell the truth in the presence of the accused (Article 168 (c) (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The persons entitled to be present shall be given prior notice of the dates set down for the hearings. The notification shall be dispensed with if it would endanger the success of the investigation (Article 168 (c) (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n42. Defence counsel may be appointed during preliminary proceedings; the public prosecution office shall request such an appointment if in its opinion the assistance of defence counsel in the main proceedings will be mandatory (Article 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The assistance of defence counsel is mandatory if, inter alia, the main hearing is held at first instance before the Regional Court or the accused is charged with a serious criminal offence (Article 140 (1) nos. 1, 2 and 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\n43. In a leading judgment of 25 July 2000 (published in the official reports, BGHSt, volume 46, p. 96 et seq.) the Federal Court of Justice held that Article 141 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure required, in view of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) of the Convention, the investigative authorities to consider the appointment of counsel for an unrepresented accused if the key witness for the prosecution was to testify before an investigating judge and the accused was excluded from this hearing. In the event such key witness would dispose of a statutory right not to testify at the accused\u2019s possible ensuing trial, the appointment of counsel was, as a rule, necessary in order to counter the danger that the accused would be deprived of his right under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (d) to examine the key witness at any stage of the proceedings.\n44. Article 238 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that the presiding judge shall conduct the hearing, examine the defendant and take the evidence. Article 240 (2) stipulates that the presiding judge shall, upon request, give permission to the public prosecution office, to the defendant, and to defence counsel, as well as to the lay judges to address questions to the defendant, witnesses and experts. According to Article 244 (2) the court, in order to establish the truth, shall, proprio motu, extend the taking of evidence to all facts and means of proof relevant to the decision.\n45. Pursuant to Article 251 (1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure the examination of a witness may be replaced by reading out a record of another examination or a certificate that contains a written statement originating from the witness if the latter has died or cannot be examined by the court for another reason within a foreseeable period of time. Examination of a witness may also be replaced by reading out the written record of his previous examination by a judge if illness, infirmity, or other insurmountable impediments prevent the witness from appearing at the main hearing for a long or indefinite period.\n46. Article 257 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that after each co-defendant has been examined and after evidence has been taken in each individual case the defendant shall be asked whether he or she has anything to add. According to Article 258 of the said Code, the public prosecutor and subsequently the defendant shall further be given the opportunity to present their arguments and to file applications after the taking of evidence has been concluded\n47.

THE JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS\n177. The Court decides, in pursuance of Rule 42 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court, to join the applications in view of their similarity in terms of the facts and the legal issues which they raise, and decides to examine them jointly under one judgment.\n...\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES 10 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. In the two applications examined by the Court, the allegations put forward by the applicant in his capacity as an independent candidate who, as a matter of principle, does not belong to any political party are of two different types: firstly, pursuant to section 94 II a) of Law no. 298, Turkish citizens who have been living outside Turkey for over six months can vote in the polling stations set up at customs posts only for the lists presented by the political parties, not for the independent candidates; secondly, in accordance with section 52 (1) of Law no. 298, in his capacity as an independent candidate, the applicant could not transmit election broadcasts on the TRT on the same basis as the political parties taking part in the 2007 parliamentary elections. The applicant relies on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 in conjunction with Articles 10 and 14 of the Convention.\n39. The Court reiterates that it has already held in an electoral context that it is necessary to consider the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 in the light of the right to free elections protected by Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (see Bowman v. the United Kingdom, 19 February 1998, \u00a7 41, Report of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011I, and TV Vest AS and Rogaland Pensjonistparti v. Norway, no. 21132/05, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2008). That being so, it decides to examine the applicant\u2019s complaints solely from the angle of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 taken on its own or in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in (the) Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 3 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n40. The applicant considered that the difference in treatment between the political parties and, on the one hand, the candidates included in the party lists and, on the other, independent candidates such as himself did not pursue any legitimate aim. He was of the view that such treatment had excluded him from the political debate and had constituted unjustified interference in the citizens\u2019 right to receive information during the parliamentary elections in question.\n41. The applicant pointed out that competition between individual candidates affiliated to a political party and the other unaffiliated independent candidates was distorted. He contested the technical necessity argument put forward by the Government to justify the impugned difference in treatment. He submitted that that did not release the respondent State from the obligation to assiduously take the requisite action to overcome this difficulty, particularly as the Law had been enacted over 27 years previously. Referring to the case-law of the Court, the applicant submitted that in the context of the right to free elections the respondent State had the positive obligation to take all the necessary action, and not only the obligation to refrain from interfering. He took the view that this was not a restriction but a prohibition, inasmuch as the Law made it impossible for electors to vote for unaffiliated independent candidates in the polling stations set up at customs posts or for such candidates to engage in electioneering on TRT. The applicant added that the Court\u2019s case-law suggested that electioneering had a more immediate impact when broadcast on television and radio than when published in the press. Moreover, election broadcasts on the State radio and television were free for political parties. Nor could unaffiliated independent candidates, in fact, engage in any advertising of a political nature. Giving the political parties the opportunity to do so would be incompatible with the respondent State\u2019s duty to remain neutral and its positive obligation to keep the electorate informed about candidates standing in elections.\n42. The applicant submitted that facilities for electioneering on the Internet had been introduced under an amendment of 8 April 2010 incorporated into Law no. 298. Consequently, such facilities were unavailable to the applicant for the 22 July 2007 parliamentary elections.\n43. The", "001-144123": "\ufeff\nFIFTH SECTION\nCASE OF GRAY v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Relevant German law in connection with the criminal proceedings instituted against U.\n52. Pursuant to Article 222 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) a person causing the death of another person through negligence shall be liable to imprisonment of not more than five years or a fine. Article 12 stipulates that unlawful acts punishable by a minimum sentence of less than one year\u2019s imprisonment or by a fine shall be qualified as misdemeanours. Article 56 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code provides that prison sentences which do not exceed two years may be suspended and probation be granted under the conditions specified in that provision.\n53. Articles 5 to 7 of the Criminal Code deal with the jurisdiction of Germany for offences committed abroad. The relevant part of Article 7 stipulates that German criminal law shall apply to offences committed abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence at the place where it was committed and if the offender was a German national at the time he committed the offence.\n54. In accordance with Article 152 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) the public prosecution authorities shall, as a rule, be obliged to take action in relation to all prosecutable criminal offences, provided there are sufficient factual indications that an offence was committed. Article 160 stipulates that as soon as the public prosecution authorities obtain knowledge of a suspected criminal offence either through a criminal complaint or by other means it shall investigate the facts to decide whether a bill of indictment is to be issued.\n55. The rules concerning a conviction of an offender by penal order are to be found in Articles 407 to 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 407, as far as relevant, provides that in proceedings before the criminal court judge a sentence for an offence that qualifies as a misdemeanour may be imposed by a written penal order without a main hearing upon written application by the public prosecution office. The public prosecution authorities shall file such application, if they do not consider a main hearing to be necessary given the outcome of the investigations. The application shall refer to specific legal consequences. It shall constitute the formal bill of indictment. Only certain sentences may be imposed for an offence by penal order, such as, inter alia, a fine or - where the accused is represented by counsel - imprisonment not exceeding one year, provided its execution is suspended on probation. In the case of suspension on probation, it is possible to impose in addition the payment of a certain sum of money for the benefit of a non-profit organisation or the treasury (Article 56b \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code). Article 408 \u00a7 3 stipulates that the judge shall comply with the public prosecutor\u2019s application if he has no reservations about issuing the penal order. He shall set down a date for the main hearing if he has reservations about deciding the case on the basis of a written procedure, if he wishes to deviate from the public prosecutor\u2019s legal assessment in the application to issue the penal order, or if he wishes to impose a legal consequence other than the one applied for by the public prosecutor and the latter disagrees. In accordance with Article 409 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the penal order shall contain information as regards, inter alia, personal data of the defendant and of any other persons involved, the offence the defendant is charged with, the time and place of its commission, the evidence on which the statement of facts and legal assessment are based as well as the legal consequences imposed. It should further advise on the possibility of filing an objection against the penal order and that the latter shall become effective and executable if no such objection i", "001-144354": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF Y\u0130\u011e\u0130TDO\u011eAN v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n34. The applicant alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during his time in police custody in both Izmir and Istanbul. He maintained that although he had been beaten, subjected to electric shocks, hung by the arms and sexually assaulted, he had not had a thorough medical examination. In this connection, he argued that the domestic court had failed to obtain the medical reports which would have proved his allegations, and that the authorities had not conducted any investigation into the matter. He relied on Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention.\nThe Court considers that these complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n35. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged outside the six-month period, in that he must have become aware by 12 September 2008 at the latest that there would not be an effective investigation, when the Istanbul Assize Court delivered its judgment without taking account of his allegations of ill\u2011treatment.\n36. The Court notes that during the criminal proceedings instigated against him the applicant brought his allegations of ill-treatment to the attention of the domestic court several times, but to no avail. In his appeal against the Istanbul Assize Court\u2019s judgment of 12 September 2008, which did not refer to those allegations in any way, the applicant raised the matter once again. However, the higher court did not refer to them either. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s expectation that the Court of Cassation would respond to his allegations was justifiable.

Relying on Article 5, he further complained that he would be likely to be detained after his transfer to Hungary, which would subject him to inhuman and degrading treatment. The Court considers that the complaint regarding the detention conditions in Hungary in fact also falls under Article 3, and will consequently be examined under that head. Article 3 reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n47. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Planning of railway construction\n27. The planning of railway construction is regulated in the Railway Construction Act (Lagen om byggande av j\u00e4rnv\u00e4g, 1995:1649). In addition, during planning and review of a railway construction, the general provisions in Chapter 2-4 of the Environmental Code (Milj\u00f6balken) apply, stipulating, inter alia, that the site least intrusive on the interests of human health and the environment should be chosen for activities and installations.\n28. The planning process of a railway construction is divided into three phases, in which the work is intended to gradually develop from outline studies to detailed plans and in which the outcome of one phase is intended to serve as a starting point for the next phase. Consideration is to be given to private interests as well as public interests such as the protection of the environment. The process begins with a preliminary study to identify and examine possible options to find out which alternatives warrant further study. The enterprise intending to build the railway is required by the regulations in the Environmental Code to consult relevant county administration boards, municipalities and non-profit organisations whose purpose is to safeguard nature protection and environmental interests, as well as parts of the general public who are likely to be particularly affected.\n29. A railway investigation is to be conducted when the preliminary study shows that alternative routes should be examined. The alternatives and their consequences should be described so as to allow them to be compared both with one another and with the alternative of not carrying out any railway expansion at all. A railway investigation should include consultation with the country administrative board, supervisory authorities and individuals who are likely to be particularly affected. The investigation must contain an environmental impact assessment formulated in accordance with the regulations of the Environmental Code. The investigation results in the National Transport Administration (Trafikverket; before April 2010: the NRA) deciding on a corridor in the terrain where the railway should be located.\n#### B. The Government\u2019s permissibility assessment\n30. Major railway projects are also subject to a Government permissibility assessment (Chapter 17 of the Environmental Code). The permissibility assessment is made on the basis of the railway investigation. No appeal lies from the Government\u2019s decision, but a judicial review of the decision can be obtained through an application to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n31. According to the preparatory works of the Environmental Code, the Government\u2019s decision on the issue of permissibility is binding on subsequent reviews. Hence, if the Government has reviewed the permissibility of an activity, courts and authorities cannot review this issue (Government Bill 1997/98:45, part 1, pp. 436 et seq.). In principle, the Government\u2019s assessment should take place at a relative early stage of the process and primarily concern the permissibility of an activity. The issue of permissibility under the Code also includes the issue of the location of the activities (ibid., pp. 440 et seq.).

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n47. The applicant complained that in its decision of 12 June 2008 the High Court had dismissed his appeal against the City Court\u2019s judgment of 21 January 2008 without providing adequate reasons, in breach of the fair hearing guarantee in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n48. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s submissions\n49. The Government disputed the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention to the impugned decision taken by the High Court to refuse to admit the applicant\u2019s appeal for examination on the merits. Although the dispute was one that concerned his \u201ccivil rights\u201d, the decision in question could not be said to constitute a \u201cdetermination\u201d of that right within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. In this connection, relying on Athanassoglou and Others v. Switzerland [GC] (no. 27644/95, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000\u2011IV), the Government emphasised that \u201c[t]he outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question\u201d and that \u201cmere tenuous connections or remote consequences [were] not sufficient to bring Article 6 \u00a7 1 into play\u201d. Moreover, in Gorou v. Greece (no. 2) [GC] (no. 12686/03, \u00a7 29, 20 March 2009) the Grand Chamber had held that \u201cin assessing whether there [was] a dispute over a civil right, one must look beyond the appearances and the language used and concentrate on the realities of the situation ... according to the circumstances of each case\u201d.\n50. The Government submitted that in the instant case the 2001 judgment of the City Court was final and also settled the dispute between the parties to the 2008 proceedings. The decision concerning the appeal to the High Court in 2008, however, determined a different question, namely whether or not the applicant\u2019s case should be examined again. The High Court\u2019s decision \u2013 having regard to \u201cthe realities of the situation\u201d in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case \u2013 had only tenuous connections or remote consequences to the \u201ccivil right\u201d in question. It differed, for example, from a decision that either confirmed or quashed a previous judgment.\n51. Thus, with reference to the particular circumstances of the case, the Government invited the Court to hold that Article 6 \u00a7 1 did not apply to the case at hand and to declare the application inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention, in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3(a) and 4.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n52. The applicant, disagreeing with the Government, maintained that from the Court\u2019s case-law it followed that the scope of applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention ought not to be interpreted restrictively. Not only the City Court but also the High Court expressly determined the private property rights of the applicant and their decisions were \u201cdirectly decisive\u201d for the existence, scope or modalities of the rights and obligations concerned.\n53. The Government\u2019s suggestion that the 2001 proceedings provided a final determination of the applicant\u2019s property rights and that the 2008 proceedings simply regarded the question of whether the case should be examined again was incorrect. Whilst it was true that the 2008 proceedings concerned some elements that had also been assessed during the 2001 proceedings, in the 2008 case the applicant also presented several arguments that had not been examined in the 2001 case, notably circumstances occurred after the 2001 judgment (see paragraph 11 (d) above). The 2008 proceedings clearly consisted of more than a simple review of the 2001 judgment, as was confirmed by the fact that in 2008 the City Court held a hearing and delivered a judgment in a procedure for decision on the merits, instead of dismissing the case as having been previously decided.\n54. Thus, both formally and substantively, the 2008 proceedings involved a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the applicant\u2019s private property rights. Article 6 \u00a7 1 was accordingly applicable to the proceedings at issue.\n##### 3. Assessment by the Court\n55. The Court, having regard to the applicant\u2019s submissions to the City Court in the proceedings leading to its judgment of 2008 and its own case-law, is satisfied that they concerned a dispute over a civil right, namely his claim against the respondent company of a right of ownership to a part of the property in question, that could be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see, for instance, Vilho Eskelinen and Others v. Finland [GC], no. 63235/00, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2007\u2011II; and K.T. v. Norway, no. 26664/03, \u00a7 82, 25 September 2008). The dispute was genuine and serious; it related not only to the actual existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise (ibid.).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n32. According to Chapter 4, section 14, of the Enforcement Code (Uts\u00f6kningsbalken, 1981:774), a debtor is liable to provide the information about his assets that is needed in the case. The Enforcement Authority may order the debtor to submit a list of his assets and, if necessary, it may appoint an appropriate person to assist the debtor in the preparation of the list. The debtor may also be ordered to confirm in writing, on his honour and faith, the information about his assets that he has provided on questioning or in a list.\n33. The preparatory works to this provision (Government Bill 1980/81:8, p. 405) specify that the debtor\u2019s liability not only applies to what assets he or she owns but also to their whereabouts. Moreover, this liability applies as long as the matter is under consideration by the Enforcement Authority.\n34. It follows from Chapter 2, section 15, of the Enforcement Code that when the Enforcement Authority, in accordance with Chapter 4, section 14, orders the debtor to do or to cease doing something, the Authority may order the imposition of a conditional fine (vite) in the amount considered necessary. Issues concerning the confirmation of conditional fines that have been ordered in this manner are considered, upon request by the Enforcement Authority, by the District Court.\n35. Chapter 2, section 16, of the Enforcement Code provides that if a debtor does not comply with an order pursuant to Chapter 4, section 14, he or she may be detained if there are extraordinary reasons. Following a request by the Enforcement Authority, the District Court shall examine the issue of detention. The court shall hold an oral hearing to which the Enforcement Authority and the debtor shall be summoned. The provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure concerning defenders and concerning litigation costs in criminal cases shall apply correspondingly to issues concerning the right to counsel and costs in the case. Following the first hearing, the Court shall, at intervals of at most two weeks, hold hearings in order to consider whether the debtor should still be detained.

At the material time, Section 27(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act (Law no. 2577) provided that the implementation of an administrative decision or act would not automatically be suspended following an application to the administrative courts. Under Section 27(2), the administrative courts could order a stay of execution if the decision or act in question was manifestly unlawful and if its implementation would cause irreversible harm.\nThe relevant parts of Section 28 of the same Law provided as follows at the relevant time:\n\u201c(1) The authorities shall be obliged to adopt decisions without delay or to take action in accordance with the decisions on the merits or any request for a stay of execution issued by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts, or the courts dealing with tax disputes. Under no circumstances may the time taken to act exceed thirty days following service of the decision on the authorities.\n...\n(3) Where the authorities do not adopt a decision or do not act in accordance with a decision by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts, or the tax courts, a claim for compensation in respect of pecuniary or non\u2011pecuniary damage may be lodged against the authorities with the Supreme Administrative Court and the other relevant courts.\n(4) In the event of the deliberate failure on the part of a civil servant to enforce a judicial decision within the thirty days [following the decision], compensation proceedings may be instigated against both the authorities and the civil servant who has refused to enforce the decision in question.\u201d\n15. Article 41 of the Code of Obligations (Law no. 818) in force at the material time provided as follows:\n\u201cAny person who causes damage to another in an unjust manner, be it wilfully, negligently or imprudently, shall afford redress for that damage.\u201d\n16. Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Law no. 5271) sets out the circumstances in which a person detained during criminal investigation or prosecution may claim compensation from the State.\n17.

This provision states:\n\u201cThe personal rights of an individual, such as, in particular, health, liberty, reputation (cze\u015b\u0107), freedom of conscience, name or pseudonym, image, secrecy of correspondence, inviolability of the home, scientific or artistic work, [as well as] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions.\u201d\n25. Article 24 of the Civil Code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights. According to that provision, a person facing the danger of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity, unless it is not unlawful. Where an infringement has taken place, the person affected may, inter alia, request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form, or claim just satisfaction from him or her. If an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss, the person concerned may seek damages.\n26.

Relying on Articles 7, 9 and 11 of the Convention, the applicants alleged that their conviction had been based on their participation in a religious ceremony, which had consisted of a mere public manifestation of their religious observance. They further argued that their conviction had not been sufficiently foreseeable in the light of the wording of section 7(2) of Law no. 3713, which had been applied to their detriment.\nThe Court finds that the situation in issue concerns questions that can be examined under various Convention provisions including those relied upon by the applicants.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 6 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention that no effective investigation had been conducted by the authorities into the disappearance of her husband in light of the new evidence discovered in 2009.\n30. The Court considers that the complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 2 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\n2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:\n(a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;\n(b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;\n(c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.\u201d\n31. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n32. The Government have not raised any objections to the admissibility of the application. In any event, the Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, 9 July 2013.\n10. As regards the discretion of the Secretary of State for Justice to release a prisoner sentenced to a whole life order, section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201csection 30\u201d) provides that he may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds. The criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued by the Secretary of State as Prison Service Order 4700 in April 2010.\nChapter 12 of the Lifer Manual, where relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe criteria for compassionate release on medical grounds for all indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISP) are as follows:\n\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stroke;\nand\n\u2022 the risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\n\u2022 further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\n\u2022 there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\n\u2022 early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family.\u201d\n[underlining in the original]\n11. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State, as a public authority, is bound to act compatibly with the scheduled Convention rights, including Article 3. Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act, legislation is to be interpreted so far as it is possible to do so compatibly with the Convention.\n12. A summary of the existing domestic case-law relating to the compatibility of the whole life order scheme with Article 3 of the Convention, notably the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes and Others and the House of Lords judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, was set out in Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58.\n13.

De Gaetano,\nAndr\u00e9 Potocki,\nHelena J\u00e4derblom, judges,\nand Claudia Westerdiek, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 13 January 2015,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction\n61. The relevant provisions of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (hereinafter \u201cthe Hague Convention\u201d) state as follows:\nArticle 1\n\u201cThe objects of the present Convention are -\n(a) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State; and\n(b) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.\u201d\nArticle 8\n\u201cAny person, institution or other body claiming that a child has been removed or retained in breach of custody rights may apply either to the Central Authority of the child\u2019s habitual residence or to the Central Authority of any other Contracting State for assistance in securing the return of the child.\n...\u201d\nArticle 21\n\u201cAn application to make arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access may be presented to the Central Authorities of the Contracting States in the same way as an application for the return of a child.\nThe Central Authorities are bound by the obligations of co-operation which are set forth in Article 7 to promote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and the fulfilment of any conditions to which the exercise of those rights may be subject. The Central Authorities shall take steps to remove, as far as possible, all obstacles to the exercise of such rights.\nThe Central Authorities, either directly or through intermediaries, may initiate or assist in the institution of proceedings with a view to organising or protecting these rights and securing respect for the conditions to which the exercise of these rights may be subject.\u201d\nArticle 29\nThis Convention shall not preclude any person, institution or body who claims that there has been a breach of custody or access rights within the meaning of Article 3 or 21 from applying directly to the judicial or administrative authorities of a Contracting State, whether or not under the provisions of this Convention.\n62. The Explanatory Report on the Hague Convention prepared by Elisa P\u00e9rez-Vera and published by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH) in 1982 states, with regard to Article 29, that the aim of the convention is to provide additional means for helping persons whose custody or contact rights have been breached. Those persons have a choice either to apply directly to the Central Authorities, as provided for in the Hague Convention, or to institute relevant proceedings before the authorities of the State where the child is located. In such a case, where the applicants have recourse to a direct action before the competent authorities, they can choose to submit their application \u201cwhether or not under the provisions\u201d of the Hague Convention. In the latter case, according to the explanatory report, the authorities are not obliged to apply the provisions of the convention unless they have been incorporated in their domestic law.\n#### B. Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003\n63. The relevant provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No. 1347/2000 (hereinafter \u201cthe Brussels IIa Regulation\u201d), regulate the enforceability of certain judgments concerning rights of access or the return of the child and read as follows:\nArticle 40 (Scope)\n\u201c1. This Section shall apply to:\n(a) rights of access;\nand\n(b) the return of a child entailed by a judgment given pursuant to Article 11(8).\n...\u201d\nArticle 41 (Rights of access)\n\u201c1. The rights of access referred to in Article 40(1)(a) granted in an enforceable judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with paragraph 2.\nEven if national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law of a judgment granting access rights, the court of origin may declare that the judgment shall be enforceable, notwithstanding any appeal.\n2. The judge of origin shall issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 using the standard form in Annex III (certificate concerning rights of access) only if:\n(a) where the judgment was given in default, the person defaulting was served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable that person to arrange for his or her defense, or, the person has been served with the document but not in compliance with these conditions, it is nevertheless established that he or she accepted the decision unequivocally;\n(b) all parties concerned were given an opportunity to be heard;\nand\n(c) the child was given an opportunity to be heard, unless a hearing was considered inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity.\nThe certificate shall be completed in the language of the judgment.\n3. Where the rights of access involve a cross-border situation at the time of the delivery of the judgment, the certificate shall be issued ex officio when the judgment becomes enforceable, even if only provisionally. If the situation subsequently acquires a cross-border character, the certificate shall be issued at the request of one of the parties.\u201d\n#### C. Slovenian domestic law and practice\n##### 1. Family law applicable at the material time\n64. A summary of the relevant applicable domestic law may be found in paragraphs 63-71 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Eberhard and M. v. Slovenia (nos. 8673/05 and 9733/05, 1 December 2009).\n2. Rules on the service of official documents to absent parties and parties living abroad\n(a) Relevant rules of administrative procedure\n65.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 ... OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that the civil-law regime, as applied to her at the material time, had entailed a violation of her right to respect for her private and family life as provided in Article 8 of the Convention ..., which read[s] as follows:\n...\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n...\n17.

The applicant, reiterating the submissions she had made to the domestic courts (see paragraph 7 above), argued that in the present case the State had not respected her right to enjoy to the full her private and family life with her adopted son. In her view, the distinction made by the national authorities between single-parent and two-parent adoptions constituted an unjustified interference which was detrimental to her and which was also discriminatory, being based on her status as a spinster.\n23.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Powers of arrest and detention of terrorist suspects under the 2000 Act\n28. Section 40 of the 2000 Act defines a terrorist as a person who has committed an offence under various sections of the Act or who is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.\n29. Section 41(1) of the 2000 Act provides that a constable may arrest without warrant a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist.\n30. Part II of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act deals with the detention of such a person by police during the first forty-eight hours.\n31. Section 41(3) of the 2000 Act provides that a detained person must be released not later than the end of the period of forty-eight hours beginning with the time of the arrest subject to subsections (4) to (7) set out below.\n\u201c(4) If on a review of a person\u2019s detention under Part II of Schedule 8 the review officer does not authorise continued detention, the person shall (unless detained in accordance with subsection (5) or (6) or under any other power) be released.\n(5) Where a police officer intends to make an application for a warrant under paragraph 29 of Schedule 8 extending a person\u2019s detention, the person may be detained pending the making of the application.\n(6) Where an application has been made under paragraph 29 or 36 of Schedule 8 in respect of a person\u2019s detention, he may be detained pending the conclusion of proceedings on the application.\n(7) Where an application under paragraph 29 or 36 of Schedule 8 is granted in respect of a person\u2019s detention, he may be detained, subject to paragraph 37 of that Schedule, during the period specified in the warrant.\u201d\n32. Paragraph 29 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act provides that the DPP for Northern Ireland may apply to a judicial authority for the issue of a warrant of further detention. Pursuant to paragraph 29(3), the period of further detention shall be seven days from the time of the arrest under section 41 of the 2000 Act unless the application is for a shorter period or the judicial authority is satisfied that there are circumstances that would make it inappropriate for the specified period to be as long as the period of seven days.\n33. In Northern Ireland the judicial authority under the 2000 Act is a County Court Judge or a District Judge (Magistrates\u2019 Court) who has been designated for the purposes of the Act.\n34. Paragraph 30 of Schedule 8 requires the application for the warrant to be made during the period of the initial detention or within six hours of the end of that period.\n35. Paragraph 31 ensures that an application for a warrant cannot be heard until the person to whom it relates has been given a notice stating that the application has been made, the time at which it was made, the time at which it is to be heard, and the grounds upon which further detention is sought.\n36. Paragraph 32(1) provides that a judicial authority may only issue a warrant of further detention if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of the person is necessary and that the investigation in connection with which the person is detained is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.\n37. Paragraph 32(1A) provides that the further detention of a person is required if it is necessary\n\u201c(a) to obtain relevant evidence whether by questioning him or otherwise;\n(b) to preserve relevant evidence; or\n(c) pending the result of an examination or analysis of any relevant evidence or of anything the examination or analysis of which is to be or is being carried out with a view to obtaining relevant evidence.\u201d\n38. Relevant evidence is evidence which relates to the commission of an offence under section 40 or an indication that the person detained is a person falling within that section.\n39. Paragraph 33 requires that a person to whom an application relates be given an opportunity to make oral or written representations to the judicial authority and be legally represented at the hearing.

THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n33. Relying on Article 9 of the Convention and Article 10 taken in conjunction with Article 14, the applicant submitted that he had been prosecuted for expressing his opinions. He had criticised the higher echelons of the armed forces because in his view a number of senior officers had inappropriately interfered in the country\u2019s general politics.\n34. He further alleged that the proceedings against him for offences involving denigration of the army or its commanding officers had marked him out as a \u201ctarget\u201d and had been such as to deter him from exercising his profession. He took the view that those proceedings, in conjunction with other criminal proceedings brought on the grounds of his articles, had constituted a threat against him and also against all journalists dealing with political topics, including the unlawful influence of military personnel on governmental affairs.\n35. The Court, as master of the characterisation to be given in law to the facts of a case (see, for example, S\u00f6derman c. Sweden [GC], no. 5786/08, \u00a7 57, ECHR 2013, and Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC], no. 29217/12, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2014 [extracts]), considers that these complaints must be assessed solely under Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n...\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Existence of interference\n40. The applicant submitted that the Military Prosecutor\u2019s Office, at the request of the military authorities, had charged him with criminal offences subject to sentences of several years\u2019 imprisonment. He added that his trial had lasted six-and-a-half years before the criminal courts, two-and-a-half years of them before the military courts. He explained that at the material time the military courtrooms had been located inside military areas, access to which involved various checks and long, complicated transfers. He had spent all those years in fear, under threat of conviction and incarceration in a military prison or of provisional detention in a military jail.\n41. The applicant added that the commanding officers of the armed forces whom he had criticised regarding their interference, which he considered unlawful and inappropriate, in the general political activities of the Government, had subsequently been prosecuted and even convicted by the criminal courts for an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. This demonstrated that his comments on the behaviour of the senior officers had not been gratuitous claims based on erroneous information, but observations based on proven facts, in a sphere which was of very great interest to the general public.\n42. The applicant also submitted that in view of the other similar criminal and civil proceedings which had been brought against him, the pressure exerted on him by the impugned criminal proceedings had become a genuine threat and had prevented him from writing about the military interference in general politics.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicants complained under Article 2 of the Convention that the delay in transferring To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin to the hospital from his regiment had delayed his access to appropriate treatment and had thus caused his death. They argued that, as To\u011fay G\u00fcltekin had been under the authority of the military administration during his compulsory military service, the State should be held responsible for his death which, they believed, had been caused as a result of the authorities\u2019 negligence. The applicants also relied on Article 6 of the Convention and argued that the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Military Court had not been conducted fairly. In this connection, they stated that their objection to the medical expert report had not been taken into account and that the Military Administrative Court had failed to interpret the facts of the case correctly and that no effective investigation had been carried out.\n24.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Provisions of the Lower Saxony Public Security and Order Act\n42. Under section 18 \u00a7 1 no. 2 of the Lower Saxony Public Security and Order Act, on custody, the administrative authorities and the police may take a person into custody if this is indispensable in order to prevent the imminent commission or continuation of a criminal or regulatory offence of considerable importance to the general public.\n43. Section 19 \u00a7 2 of the Lower Saxony Public Security and Order Act, on judicial review, provides that the detained person may request, even after the termination of the detention, a review of the lawfulness of the detention within one month. The request shall be lodged with the District Court in whose district the person was taken into custody. The District Court\u2019s decision is subject to appeal to the Regional Court (see section 19 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3).\n44. Pursuant to section 20 \u00a7 4 of the Lower Saxony Public Security and Order Act, on the treatment of detained persons, the detained person may only be imposed restrictions which are necessary to attain the purpose of the deprivation of liberty or for the maintenance of order in custody.\n#### B. Provisions of the Police Custody Regulations\n45. The relevant provisions of the Police Custody Regulations, in the version in force at the time of the applicant\u2019s detention, were issued by the Lower Saxony Ministry for the Interior on 2 July 2001 and were applicable until 31 December 2008. They contained rules on the execution of police custody.\n46. No. 10 of the Police Custody Regulations, on stays outside, provided that persons who were taken into custody for more than 24 hours should be given the opportunity to stay outside for 45 minutes per day in so far as the staffing and infrastructural situation permitted so.\n47. Under no. 11.1 of the Police Custody Regulations, on visits, detained persons could receive visits in so far as the purpose or execution of the detention order was not endangered thereby. Visits, other than those by lawyers, had to be authorised by the competent police authority.\n48. No. 12 of the Police Custody Regulations, on night\u2019s rest, provided that persons taken into custody had a right to sufficient night\u2019s sleep, from 9 p.m. until 6 a.m., in so far as the operational events permitted so.\n49. Pursuant to no. 15.1 of the Police Custody Regulations, detention cells had to be equipped with a fixed bed, a mattress, one to two blankets and an interphone or bell. Under no. 15.3 of the said Regulations, the cells had to be sufficiently tempered, illuminated and aired.\n### III. RELEVANT REPORTS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE FOR THE PREVENTION OF TORTURE AND INHUMAN OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT\n50. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) of the Council of Europe issues the CPT standards, in which the \u201csubstantive\u201d sections of the CPT\u2019s yearly General Reports are summarized. In its CPT standards as established at the time of the applicant\u2019s police custody (CPT/Inf/E (2002) 1 \u2011 Rev. 2006), which have not been amended since then in respect of the issues relevant here (see CPT/Inf/E (2002) \u2011 Rev. 2015), the CPT made the following findings and recommendations in respect of police custody:\n\u201cExtract from the 2nd General Report [CPT/Inf (92) 3]\n42. Custody by the police is in principle of relatively short duration. Consequently, physical conditions of detention cannot be expected to be as good in police establishments as in other places of detention where persons may be held for lengthy periods. However, certain elementary material requirements should be met.\nAll police cells should be of a reasonable size for the number of persons they are used to accommodate, and have adequate lighting (i.e. sufficient to read by, sleeping periods excluded) and ventilation; preferably, cells should enjoy natural light. Further, cells should be equipped with a means of rest (eg. a fixed chair or bench), and persons obliged to stay overnight in custody should be provided with a clean mattress and blankets.\nPersons in custody should be allowed to comply", "001-157755": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF AKKOYUNLU v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention that because his regiment had not immediately referred him to a hospital, his access to appropriate medical treatment had been delayed, which had led to the loss of sight in his left eye. He argued that, as he had been under the control of the military authorities during his compulsory military service, the State should be held responsible for the damage he had sustained. Relying on Article 13 of the Convention, the applicant also complained that he had not had an effective domestic remedy which could have provided him with redress for his complaints.\n24. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s arguments.\n25. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 3 of the Convention only, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A.

Section 202(1), as amended by the 2002 Act, entitles an applicant to request a review of the decision of council under Part VII of the 1996 Act.\n28. The Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Review Procedures) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/71) provide that the officer shall be someone who was not involved in the original decision and who is senior to the officer who made the original decision. The reviewer is required to consider any representations made to him. If he considers that there is a deficiency or irregularity in the original decision, or the manner in which it was made, but is minded nevertheless to make a decision which is against the interests of the applicant on one or more issues, he must notify the applicant that he is so minded and the reasons why he is of that view in order that the applicant, or someone on their behalf, may make representations.\n29. Section 204(1) of the 1996 Act provides that, if an applicant is dissatisfied with the decision on review, he may appeal to the County Court on any point of law arising from the decision or, as the case may be, the original decision. No provision is made for an appeal against the facts found by the homelessness review officer.\n30. Pursuant to section 206(1), the council may discharge its functions under Part VII in one of the following three ways:\n(a) by securing that suitable accommodation provided by them is available to the applicant;\n(b) by securing that the applicant obtains suitable accommodation from some other person; or\n(c) by giving the applicant such advice and assistance as will secure that suitable accommodation is available from some other person.\n#### B.

In his application form of 24 February 2010 and further submissions dated 1 November 2010, 29 December 2010 and 19 July 2012, the applicant complained under Article 3 of the Convention that he had been subjected to various forms of ill\u2011treatment amounting to torture while in police custody in April 2000.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n32. Article 125 of the Constitution, in so far as relevant, provides as follows:\n\u201cAll acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review ...\n...\nThe authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.\u201d\n33. This provision establishes the State\u2019s strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people\u2019s lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained damage as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons.\n34. Under the same provision the State could be held responsible for damage sustained on account of the \u201csocial risk doctrine\u201d, which is a no fault-based principle and, as such, does not require that any failure be attributed to public officials. The \u201csocial risk doctrine\u201d is a principle developed and employed by administrative courts according to which the burden of the damage caused in the fight against terrorism should be shared by society as a whole, in accordance with the principles of \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201cthe social State\u201d.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 2, 6 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n35. Relying on Articles 2, 6 and 13 of the Convention, the applicants complained that the national authorities should have been aware of the danger to the life of their relative, \u015eevket Ep\u00f6zdemir, a local provincial executive of a pro-Kurdish opposition political party, and should have protected him against an apparent risk of attack. They argued that in 1993, prior to \u015eevket Ep\u00f6zdemir\u2019s death, many DEP members had already been attacked and killed; indeed, shortly before his death, Mr Ep\u00f6zdemir had been threatened at a meeting with military officers.\n36. The applicants also alleged that the authorities had failed to carry out an effective investigation because the perpetrators had not been identified and the circumstances surrounding the killing of \u015eevket Ep\u00f6zdemir had not been clarified.\n37. The Government contested those arguments.\n38. The Court considers it appropriate to examine the applicants\u2019 complaints solely from the standpoint of Article 2 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law ...\u201d\n39. The Court notes that the applicants complain both about the national authorities\u2019 alleged failure to meet their obligation to take steps to protect the right to life of \u015eevket Ep\u00f6zdemir and also about the same authorities\u2019 alleged failure to comply with their procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the killing. Having regard to the differences in the applicable principles as regards the admissibility and merits of these two complaints, the Court considers it appropriate to examine them separately.\n#### A.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n23. Rules on the impartiality of judges and jurors are set out in sections 106 to 108 of the Administration of Courts Act (domstolloven \u2013 Law of 13 August 1915 no. 5). In the present case, the national courts relied on section 108, which reads:\n\u201cNor may a person sit as a judge or juror if there are other particular circumstances which are liable to weaken the confidence in his impartiality. This applies in particular if a party requests that he withdraws on this ground.\u201d\n24.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions on preventive detention and its enforcement\n##### 1. General legal framework\n42. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, under the twin-track system of sanctions in German criminal law and the issuing, review and practical implementation of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, \u00a7\u00a7 45-78, ECHR 2009).\n43. The provisions on preventive detention, notably in the Criminal Code, have been amended since then, in particular, by the Act on establishment, at federal level, of a difference between the provisions on preventive detention and those on prison sentences (Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung, hereinafter the \u201cPreventive Detention (Distinction) Act\u201d) of 5 December 2012, which entered into force on 1 June 2013. In that Act, the legislator adopted new rules on the enforcement of preventive detention orders and on the execution of prior prison sentences, having regard to the requirements laid down in the Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s leading judgment on preventive detention of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 66-72 below).\n44. The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows.\n##### 2. The preventive detention order issued by the sentencing court\n45. When convicting an offender, the sentencing court may, under certain circumstances, order his preventive detention (a so-called measure of correction and prevention) in addition to his prison sentence (a penalty), if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public (Article 66 of the Criminal Code).\n46. In particular, the sentencing court could order preventive detention in addition to a penalty under Article 66 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, as in force at the relevant time, if the person concerned had committed three intentional offences, each incurring a term of imprisonment of at least one year and if he was sentenced to at least three years\u2019 imprisonment for committing one or more of those offences. In addition, a comprehensive assessment of the person and his acts had to reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the person presented a danger to the general public. It was not necessary under that provision that the perpetrator had been previously convicted or detained.\n##### 3. Judicial review of preventive detention\n47. Pursuant to Article 67e of the Criminal Code, the court (that is, the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences) may review at any time whether the preventive detention should be suspended and a measure of probation applied or whether it should be terminated. The court is obliged to carry out such a review within fixed time-limits (paragraph 1 of Article 67e).\n48. Under Article 67e \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, as in force since 1 June 2013, the time-limit for review of preventive detention was one year; the time-limit is reduced to nine months once the person has been in preventive detention for ten years.\n##### 4. Duration of preventive detention\n(a) General provision\n49. Article 67d \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time-limit has not yet expired, the court will suspend on probation further enforcement of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts after release. Since 1 June 2013, Article 67d \u00a7 2 provides, in addition, that the court will also suspend on probation the further enforcement of the detention order if it finds that continuation of the detention would be disproportionate because the person concerned had not been offered, within a time-limit fixed by the court of six months at the most, sufficient care within the meaning of Article 66c \u00a7 1 sub-paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 54 below). If sufficient care has not been offered, it is for the court to fix that time-limit when it reviews the continuation of the detention and to specify the measures which have to be offered. Suspension of the detention automatically entails supervision of the conduct of the person concerned.\n(b) Provision in force prior to 31 January 1998\n50. Under Article 67d \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code, as in force prior to 31 January 1998, the first period of preventive detention could not exceed ten years. If the maximum duration had expired, the detainee was to be released (Article 67d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code).\n(c) Amended provision in force since 31 January 1998\n51. Article 67d of the Criminal Code was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other Dangerous Offences Act of 26 January 1998, which entered into force on 31 January 1998. Article 67d \u00a7 3, as amended and still in force, provides that if a person has spent ten years in preventive detention, the court will declare the measure terminated (only) if there is no danger that the detainee will, owing to his criminal tendencies, commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims. Termination automatically entails supervision of the offender\u2019s conduct. The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished. Pursuant to section 1a (3) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, the amended version of Article 67d \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis.\n(d) Transitional provision\n52. Section 316f of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, which entered into force on 1 June 2013, contains a transitional provision introduced by the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act.\n53. Section 316f(1) of the Introductory Act provides that the provisions on preventive detention in the Criminal Code, as in force since 1 June 2013, are applicable if at least one of the offences owing to which preventive detention is to be ordered was committed after 31 May 2013. In all other cases, as a rule, the provisions on preventive detention in force until 31 May 2013 have to be applied (first sentence of section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code). However, the imposition of, or order for the continuation of preventive detention on the basis of a legislative provision which had not yet entered into force at the time of the last offence at issue, or the imposition of, or order for the continuation of retrospective preventive detention is only authorised in the following circumstances. The person concerned must be suffering from a mental disorder and, owing to specific circumstances relating to his personality or conduct, it must be highly likely that he will commit a serious crime of violence or sexual offence as a result of his mental disorder (second sentence of section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code). If those additional requirements for the continuation of preventive detention are no longer met, the court declares the preventive detention terminated; supervision of the offender\u2019s conduct starts when the offender is released from detention (fourth sentence of section 316f(2) of said Act).\n##### 5. Practical implementation of preventive detention\n54. Article 66c of the Criminal Code provides for the manner in which preventive detention and prior terms of imprisonment are implemented. It was introduced by the Preventive Detention (Distinction) Act (and thus entered into force on 1 June 2013). Article 66c, in so far as relevant, provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Detainees held in preventive detention are placed in institutions which\n(1) offer the detainee, on the basis of a comprehensive examination and a personal treatment plan which is to be updated regularly, care that is\n(a) individual and intensive as well as suitable for raising and furthering his readiness to participate in particular psychiatric, psychotherapeutic or sociotherapeutic treatment, tailored to the detainee\u2019s needs if standardised offers do not have prospects of success, and\n(b) aimed at reducing the threat he poses to the public to such an extent that the measure may be suspended and probation granted or that it may be ", "001-159913": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PRUS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Freedom of the Press Act and the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression\n18. Freedom of expression in the media is regulated in the Freedom of the Press Act (Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen, 1949:105) and the Constitutional Law. The former regulates the freedom to express oneself in printed matter such as books and newspapers, and the latter regulates freedom of expression in other media such as radio, television, films, sound recordings and certain internet publications. It follows from Chapter 1, section 1(3) of the Constitutional Law that it applies to television programmes and from Chapter 1, section 6(1) that the law applies to the transmission of television programmes directed at the general public and intended for reception using technical aids.\n19. One basic principle in the legislation on freedom of expression in the media is the principle of exclusivity, which guarantees the standing of the Freedom of the Press Act and the Constitutional Law as the sole criminal and procedural laws in the areas of freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media. In other words, a statement made in media amounting to abuse of the freedom of expression and covered by either of the two laws may only be dealt with in accordance with those laws.\n20. Other basic principles are sole liability (ensamansvar), double coverage (dubbel straffbarhet) and protection of informants (meddelarskydd). The first is set out in Chapter 6, section 1 of the Constitutional Law, according to which liability for freedom of expression offences committed in a television broadcast rests only with the responsible editor. An exception applies when, for example, no qualified responsible editor had been appointed at the time when the offence was committed. In such a situation, the liability instead rests with the person responsible for appointing a responsible editor (Chapter 6, section 2). The person responsible for a freedom of expression offence shall be deemed to have had knowledge of the content of the presentation and to have consented to its publication (Chapter 6, section 4). Any other person who in some other way has contributed to the broadcast is excluded from liability.\n21. Double coverage means that sanctions against statements in the media that are protected under the Constitutional Law may only be imposed if the act is on the list of offences set out in Chapter 7, section 4 of the Freedom of the Press Act, to which Chapter 5, section 1 of the Constitutional Law refers, and at the same time is punishable under criminal law. The list includes, inter alia, defamation and insulting language or behaviour which are punishable under the Penal Code.\n22. The protection of informants and sources has several components: the freedom to communicate information (meddelarfrihet), the freedom to procure information and intelligence (anskaffarfrihet), the right to anonymity and a prohibition against inquiry (efterforskningsf\u00f6rbud), and a prohibition against reprisals (repressalief\u00f6rbud). The protection applies in relation to public authorities and other public bodies. The freedom to communicate information is set out in Chapter 1, section 1(3) of the Freedom of the Press Act and Chapter 1, section 2 of the Constitutional Law and means that everyone has the right, with impunity, to provide information on any subject for publication in a medium covered by the Freedom of the Press Act or the Constitutional Law.\n23. As noted above, the Constitutional Law is applicable to broadcasts of television programmes that are directed at the general public and intended for reception using technical aids. The scope of the Constitutional Law is primarily decided on the basis of the connection of the broadcast to Sweden. Chapter 1, section 6(2) of the Constitutional Law provides as follows:\n\u201cIn regard to ... programmes diffused through satellite broadcasts emanating from Sweden, the provisions of this constitutional law on ... programmes in general are applicable.\u201d\nIt is stated in the preparatory works to this provision that a transmission should be considered to emanate from Sweden if the uplink occurs in an area under Swedish jurisdiction or from abroad, following the transmission of the programme from Sweden via landline or radio links (Government Bill 1990/91:64, pp. 52-53 and 109-110).\n24. Although the Constitutional Law is not applicable to television programmes broadcast from transmitters outside Sweden, the protection of the freedom to communicate and the freedom to procure information and intelligence is maintained. Under the protection for correspondents (korrespondentskydd), laid down in Chapter 10, sections 1 and 2 of the Constitutional Law and Chapter 13, section 6(2) of the Freedom of the Press Act, these freedoms apply even if a radio or television programme is broadcast from transmitters outside Sweden provided that the communication or procurement takes place in Sweden (SOU 2012:55, p. 505). The provision in Chapter 10, section 2 of the Constitutional Law was interpreted in NJA 2005 p. 884 (see paragraph 32 below).\n25. Chapter 9, section 4 of the Freedom of the Press Act, to which Chapter 7, section 1 of the Constitutional Law refers, makes it clear that private prosecution can be instituted by plaintiffs in connection with libel (Chapter 7, sections 4(14) and 4(15) of the Freedom of the Press Act) and certain offences against secrecy that infringe upon an individual\u2019s interests (Chapter 7, sections 5(1) and 5(2) of the Freedom of the Press Act). Correspondents (see previous paragraph) may, however, be held liable only for a limited number of serious offences which do not include libel (Chapter 5, section 3 of the Constitutional Law).\n26.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The admission of hearsay evidence\n40. Section 114 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, where relevant, provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if, but only if \u2013\n...\n(d) the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be admissible.\n(2) In deciding whether a statement not made in oral evidence should be admitted under subsection (1)(d), the court must have regard to the following factors (and to any others it considers relevant) \u2013\n(a) how much probative value the statement has (assuming it to be true) in relation to a matter in issue in the proceedings, or how valuable it is for the understanding of other evidence in the case;\n(b) what other evidence has been, or can be, given on the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a);\n(c) how important the matter or evidence mentioned in paragraph (a) is in the context of the case as a whole;\n(d) the circumstances in which the statement was made;\n(e) how reliable the maker of the statement appears to be;\n(f) how reliable the evidence of the making of the statement appears to be;\n(g) whether oral evidence of the matter stated can be given and, if not, why it cannot;\n(h) the amount of difficulty involved in challenging the statement;\n(i) the extent to which that difficulty would be likely to prejudice the party facing it.\u201d\n41. The applicant has also provided the following summary of the guidance issued by the Court of Appeal on the proper application of section 114(d):\n(a) It cannot and should not be applied so as to render nugatory section 116 of the same Act, which allows for the admission of hearsay statements when the maker is dead, unfit, outside the United Kingdom, cannot be found, or is in fear: R v. O\u2019Hare [2006] EWCA Crim 2512; see also R v. ED [2010] EWCA Crim 1213.\n(b) Section 114(d) does not render hearsay automatically admissible. Hearsay evidence is necessarily second best evidence and it is, for that reason, much more difficult to test and to assess. The jury never sees the person whose word is being relied upon. That person cannot be asked a single exploratory question or challenging question about what he said. Those very real disadvantages of hearsay evidence, which underlay the common law rule generally excluding it, remain critical to the assessment of whether the interests of justice call for its admission. The interests of justice test will require attention to be given to the difference between an admission against interest and an accusation against someone else (R v. Y [2008] 1 Cr. App. R. 34).

Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Vaud of 12 September 1967\n19. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Vaud of 12 September 1967 read as follows.\nArticle 166 \u2013 Secrecy\n\u201cPreliminary police inquiries shall be secret. Articles 184 to 186 are applicable by analogy.\u201d\nArticle 184 \u2013 Secrecy of investigations\n\u201c1. All investigations must remain secret until their final conclusion.\n2. Secrecy shall concern all evidence uncovered by the investigation itself and all non-public investigative decisions and measures.\u201d\nArticle 185 \u2013 Persons bound to secrecy\n\u201cJudges, prosecutors and judicial staff may not disclose items of evidence or information on the investigation to anyone who does not have access to the files, except to the extent that such disclosure would be useful to the investigation or is justified on public-order, administrative or judicial grounds.\u201d\nArticle 185a\n\u201c1. The parties, their friends and relatives, their lawyers, the latter\u2019s associates, consultants and staff, and any experts and witnesses are required to observe the secrecy of the investigation vis-\u00e0-vis anyone who does not have access to the files.\n2.

The Directives relating to the Declaration of the Duties and Rights of the Journalist issued by the Swiss Press Council which are relevant to the instant case read as follows.\nDirective 3.8 \u2013 Right to be heard against grave accusations\n\u201cAccording to the principle of fairness and the general ethical requirement that both parties to a dispute must be heard (audiatur et altera pars), journalists are obliged to contact and hear, prior to publication, the views of those accused of serious offences. In so doing they must describe in detail the serious accusations which they are intending to publish. There is no obligation for the statements of the person accused of serious offences to be given the same weight in a report as the criticism of his or her actions. These statements must, however, be presented fairly when published in the same media report.\u201d\nDirective 7.2 \u2013 Identification\n\u201cJournalists must weigh carefully the various interests involved (the general public\u2019s right to information, protection of the private sphere). Names or personally identifiable information is allowed:\n\u2013 when the person involved appears publicly in relation to the issue or consents to publication in other ways;\n\u2013 when the person is famous and the media report concerns the reason for his or her celebrity;\n\u2013 when the person involved holds political office or a leading government or social position which is linked to the media report;\n\u2013 when naming the person is necessary to avoid confusion that would be deleterious to other persons;\n\u2013 when naming or identifying the person is also justified by an overriding public interest.\nWhere the interest in protecting private life outweighs the public interest in identification, journalists shall publish neither names nor any other information that would identify the person to third parties who do not belong to his or her family, social or professional sphere, and who are therefore informed solely through the media.\u201d\n### III.

INTERNATIONAL MATERIAL REGARDING THE DEPORTATION OF THE APPLICANT AND OTHER UZBEK AND AFGHAN NATIONALS TO IRAN ON 12 SEPTEMBER 2008\n31. In his report published on 1 October 2009, following his visit to Turkey on 28 June to 3 July 2009 (CommDH(2009)31), Mr Thomas Hammarberg, then Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, stated the following:\n\u201c...VI. Issues relating to forced returns of asylum seekers and refugees\n66. The Commissioner notes with concern that NGOs as well as UNHCR continue to report incidents of deportation and refoulement of UNHCR recognized refugees and registered asylum seekers. He is aware that the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) also expressed concern over these reports and called upon Turkey to refrain from deporting refugees or persons registered with UNHCR as asylum seekers...\n69. Reports indicated that in 2008 there was an increase in forcible returns of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they were at risk of serious human rights violations including irregular deportations resulting in the death or injury of asylum seekers, one example being a group of Uzbek refugees twice forcibly returned to Iran, first in September and then in October 2008. During the first forcible return, members of the group were said to have been beaten and threatened with rape unless they crossed back into Iran...\n71. UNHCR also informed the Commissioner that refugees and asylum seekers properly registered in the national procedure for temporary asylum are protected from refoulement, and the Government generally tolerates the presence of those registered only with UNHCR. However, UNHCR has observed with concern that the instances of refoulement of persons of concern to the Office are becoming more frequent. In 2008, 13 refugees recognized under UNHCR\u2019s Mandate and 9 asylum seekers were refouled (mainly to Iran and Iraq), and 50 refugees and 5 asylum seekers have been deported to third countries (mainly to Iran, Iraq and Syria).\n72. The Turkish authorities informed the Commissioner that asylum seekers, who are not granted refugee status but are assessed to have a risk of persecution in their countries of origin, are allowed to temporarily stay on grounds of subsidiary protection and protection with humanitarian considerations. The Commissioner appreciates the expressed commitment of the Turkish authorities to compliance with the principle of non-refoulement as laid out in Article 33 of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention which places a prohibition on sending asylum seekers back to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened.

The relevant provisions of \u201cthe Divorce Act\u201d read as follows:\nAdditional provision no. 10\n\u201cOn a provisional basis, until a definitive regulation is enacted in the relevant legislation, the following rules shall apply in matters concerning pensions and social security ...\n2.

Under section 174 \u00a7 1 of \u201cthe General Social Security Act\u201d non\u2011marital relationships did not entitle the survivor to a survivor\u2019s pension, even where the persons concerned had lived together. Accordingly, the award of a survivor\u2019s pension was conditional on the existence of a lawful marriage between the deceased and the claimant/survivor. Marriage was deemed to be \u201clawful\u201d when it had been celebrated in accordance with one of the forms established by Article 49 of the Civil Code.\n#### E. Law no. 13/2005 of 1 July 2005 amending the provisions of the Civil Code as regards the right to enter into marriage\n35. The relevant parts of Law no. 13/2005 read as follows:\nPreamble\n\u201cThe legislature has decided to remove a long history of discrimination based on sexual orientation. The establishment of a personal framework that allows those who freely adopt sexual and emotional ties with persons of their own sex to develop their personality and exercise their rights under equal conditions is demanded by the citizens of our time, and this law intends to provide a response to that demand.\nCertainly, when the Constitution mandates the legislature to regulate marriage it does not rule out in any way whatsoever a regulation defining partner relationships in a different way than does the regulation existing to date, a regulation covering new forms of life-partner relationships. Moreover, the option reflected in this law has some constitutional foundations that should be taken into account by the legislature. Hence, the promotion of effective equality between citizens in the free development of their personality (Articles 9 \u00a7 2 and 10 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution), the protection of freedom in so far as forms of coexistence are concerned (Article 1 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution) and the establishment of a framework of real equality and enjoyment of rights without discrimination on account of sex, opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance (Article 14 of the Constitution), are values established in the Constitution that should be reflected in the rules defining the status of citizenship in a free, pluralistic and open society. From this broad perspective, the regulation of marriage that is hereby established aims at conforming to the manifest reality of Spanish society, in which changes have been brought about in that society with the involvement of groups seeking total equality for all in the enjoyment of rights, regardless of their sexual orientation; this is a reality that demands a framework establishing rights and duties for all those who formalise their partner relationships. In this context, this Law allows marriage to be celebrated between persons of the same or different sex, with full and equal rights and duties, irrespective of its composition. Accordingly, the effects of marriage, which are wholly maintained in respect of the objective make-up of the institution, shall be the same in all spheres, regardless of the sex of the spouses; this includes, amongst other areas, the sphere of social rights and benefits as well as the possibility of being a party to adoption proceedings.\nOn the other hand, and as a consequence of the first additional provision of this Act, all references to marriage included in our legal system shall be understood as applicable both to a marriage between two persons of the same sex and to a marriage between two persons of the opposite sex.\u201d\nSingle Article. Amendment of the Civil Code as regards the right to enter into marriage\n\u201cThe Civil Code is modified as follows:\nOne.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995\n47. The relevant sections of the 1995 Act with regard to the right of appeal, the note of appeal and the written report, and the sift procedure are summarised in Beggs v. the United Kingdom, no. 25133/06, \u00a7\u00a7 171-177, 6 November 2012.\n48. Section 65 of the 1995 Act is intended to prevent delay in trials. Subsection (1) provides that a preliminary hearing, following service of an indictment, must take place within eleven months and in any event a trial must take place within twelve months of the first appearance of the accused on petition in respect of the offence. Subsection (3) allows that period to be extended retrospectively.\n49. Therefore, pursuant to the Prosecution Code, where the prosecutor decides that there is insufficient available evidence to justify proceedings in respect of a serious allegation but there is a possibility that further evidence implicating the accused will be submitted within a reasonable time, the case may be marked \u201cno proceedings meantime\u201d.\n#### B. Devolution and compatibility issues\n50. Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1998 Act\u201d) provided that the Scottish Executive (of which the Lord Advocate was a member) had no power to act in a manner incompatible with the Convention.\n51. A devolution issue, which could arise in civil or criminal cases, was an issue raised under Schedule 6 to the 1998 Act concerning whether a legislative provision or an administrative act passed or taken under the Scotland Act 1998 was within the powers of the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish Executive.\n52. In Russell v. Thomson [2010] HCJAC 138, the Appeal Court observed:\n\u201c15. A Devolution Minute in an appeal process, which complains of the actions of the lower court, does not have a life of its own. It requires to be linked to the grounds of appeal raised. In this case, these grounds are expressed in the appellant\u2019s Note of Appeal and are simply that the appellant\u2019s conduct, as spoken to by the witnesses, did not amount to a breach of the peace. The Note defines the scope of the appeal. If the appellant had wished to pursue any of the many matters contained in his Devolution Minute, he should have included them in his Note of Appeal. If he had failed to do that, he should have applied to the court to allow that Note to be amended to include them ...\u201d\n53. The Scotland Act 2012 (and in particular sections 34 \u2013 38 which came into effect on 22 April 2013) amended the 1998 Act. In particular, in criminal cases it re-categorised a number of \u201cdevolution issues\u201d which raised questions of European Union or Convention law as \u201ccompatibility issues\u201d. A compatibility issue is defined in section 288ZA of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 as being:\n\u201ca question, arising in criminal proceedings, as to\u2014\n(a) whether a public authority has acted (or proposes to act)\u2014\n(i) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998, or\n(ii) in a way which is i", "001-164453": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ZIEMBI\u0143SKI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Constitutional provisions\n23. Article 14 provides:\n\u201cThe Republic of Poland shall ensure freedom of the press and other means of social communication.\u201d\nArticle 31 \u00a7 3 of the Constitution, which lays down a general prohibition on disproportionate limitations on constitutional rights and freedoms (the principle of proportionality), provides:\n\u201cAny limitation on the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when necessary in a democratic State for the protection of its security or public order, or to protect the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms and rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights.\u201d\nArticle 54 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. It states, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cEveryone shall be guaranteed freedom to express opinions and to acquire and disseminate information.\u201d\n#### B. Relevant provisions of the Criminal Code\n24. Article 216 of the Criminal Code provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c\u00a7 1. Anyone who insults another person in his presence, or, although not in his presence, in public, or with the intention that the insult should reach that person, shall receive a fine or a penalty of restriction of liberty.\n\u00a7 2. Anyone who insults another person through the mass media shall receive a fine, a penalty of restriction of liberty or a penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to one year.\n\u00a7 5. Prosecution takes place under a private bill of indictment.\u201d\n#### C. The Constitutional Court\u2019s case-law\n25. In its judgment of 30 October 2006 (case no. P 10/06), the Constitutional Court held that Article 212 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code was compatible with Article 14 and Article 54 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution, read in conjunction with Article 31 \u00a7 3. The Constitutional Court found that, in some circumstances, the protection of rights and freedoms like dignity, good name and privacy might prevail over the protection of freedom of expression. The Court further found that there was no basis to assume that the protection of personal rights through civil law alone would be just as efficient as protection through criminal law. The protection of personal rights by means of criminal law did not, by itself, infringe the relevant provisions of the Constitution.\n26. In its judgment of 12 May 2008 (case no. SK 43/05), the Constitutional Court examined the constitutionality of the defence provided in Article 213 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code in respect of the offence of defamation committed through the mass media (Article 212 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code). It ruled that Article 213 \u00a7 2 was compatible with the Constitution in so far as it required that an allegation had to be true. The Constitutional Court held, however, that this provision was unconstitutional in so far as it necessitated that a true allegation concerning the conduct of a public official had to pursue a justifiable public interest.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained that there had been a violation of his right to freedom of expression, and alleged that the fine imposed on him had been disproportionate. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n28. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n29. The applicant argued that he had not harmed other people\u2019s good name, nor violated their rights. He had not even put the initials of the district officials in his article. He claimed to have respected the principle of accuracy required of journalists under the Press Act. Referring to the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment of 12 May 2008, the applicant argued that a person accused of insult should not be held liable if he or she had complied with the standards of accuracy and reliability in gathering and verifying information, even if eventually the relevant allegations proved to be false.\n30. The applicant asserted that he had accurately reported on the issue of the quail farm project having been appropriated by the local officials.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act\n27. The relevant provisions of the Bavarian Execution of Sentences Act (Bayerisches Strafvollzugsgesetz) concerning the examination of applications for drug substitution therapy read as follows:\nSection 2: Objectives of the execution of sentences\n\u201cThe execution of a prison sentence serves to protect the public from further crime. It shall enable prisoners to lead a socially responsible and law-abiding life in the future (obligation of treatment).\u201d\nSection 3: Treatment during the execution of a sentence\n\u201cTreatment shall include all measures which may promote a crime-free life in the future. Its purpose is to prevent the commission of further crime and to protect victims. ...\u201d\nPart 8: Health care\nSection 58: General Rules\n\u201c(1) The physical and mental health of the prisoner must be ensured. ...\u201d\nSection 60: Medical Treatment\n\u201cPrisoners are entitled to medical treatment if such treatment is necessary in order to detect or cure an illness, to prevent the aggravation of an illness or to alleviate its symptoms. Medical treatment includes:\n##### 1. treatment by a doctor,\n...\n##### 4. the provision of medicine, dressings, and other health aids,\n...\u201d\n#### B. Legal provisions and guidelines concerning drug substitution treatment\n28. Under section 13 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Narcotic Substances Act (Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz), doctors may only provide a person with drugs covered by the Act (notably methadone) if their use can be justified. The Federal Government is authorised to issue a Regulation covering the prescription and provision of such drugs, including the prescription of substitution drugs for drug addicts.\n29. Section 5 of the Prescription of Narcotic Substances Regulation (Bet\u00e4ubungsmittel-Verschreibungsverordnung), issued in accordance with section 13 of the Narcotic Substances Act, lays down rules on the prescription of narcotic substances for substitution treatment. Under section 5 \u00a7 1, the treatment of drug addicts with substitution drugs serves to treat a patient\u2019s drug addiction with the aim of gradually restoring his abstinence from narcotic substances, including the improvement and stabilisation of the patient\u2019s state of health. It may also serve to support the treatment of a serious illness the patient is suffering from alongside his or her drug addiction. Section 5 \u00a7 2 provides that a doctor may prescribe a substitution drug under the conditions laid down in section 13 of the Narcotic Substances Act unless, in particular, there are indications that the patient is consuming substances of a type or quantity endangering the objective of the substitution treatment. In accordance with section 5 \u00a7 11, the Federal Medical Association may issue guidelines codifying the recognised state of the medical art with regard to various aspects of drug substitution treatment. Compliance with the state of the medical art shall be assumed if and insofar as the guidelines in this respect were observed.\n30. Relying on section 5 \u00a7 11 of the Prescription of Narcotic Substances Regulation, the Federal Medical Association issued its Guidelines for the Substitution Treatment of Opiate Addicts of 19 February 2010. In the Guidelines\u2019 preamble, it is clarified that opiate addiction is a serious chronic disease requiring medical treatment and that substitution treatment was a scientifically tested form of therapy for manifest opiate addiction. The aims of drug substitution therapy included securing the survival of the patient, the reduction of the use of other drugs, the stabilisation of the patient\u2019s health and the treatment of further diseases, the participation in social and work life and a drug-free life. Paragraph 2 of the Guidelines provides that drug substitution treatment is indicated in cases of manifest opiate addiction as defined by the International Classification of Diseases if, in the circumstances of the case, it has more prospects of success than abstinence\u2011based therapies. In individual reasoned cases, drug substitution treatment may also be started in case of drug addicts who are currently abstinent but placed in a protective environment such as a prison. Paragraph 8 of the Guidelines provides that in case of imprisonment, the continuity of the substitution treatment by the institution in which the patient is placed is to be secured. Under paragraph 12 of the Guidelines, substitution treatment shall be discontinued if it is accompanied by a continuous, ", "001-166486": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ERKENOV v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. Section 81 (c) of Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties (published in the Official Gazette of 24 April 1983) reads as follows:\nPrevention of the creation of minorities\n\u201cPolitical parties\n(c) cannot use a language other than Turkish when writing and printing party constitutions or programmes, at their congresses and open-air or indoor meetings, and while engaged in propaganda activities; they cannot use or distribute placards, phonograph recordings, audio and video tapes, brochures and statements written in a language other than Turkish; they cannot remain indifferent to such actions and acts when committed by others. However, it is possible to translate party statutes and programmes into foreign languages other than those forbidden by law.\u201d\n14. At the material time, section 117 of Law no. 2820 provided for a minimum of six months\u2019 imprisonment for those who committed acts prohibited by Chapter IV of Law no. 2820.\n15. On 12 January 2012 the Constitutional Court declared section 117 unconstitutional and abrogated it (merits no: 2011/62, decision no: 2012/2).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. International law\n27. Article 3 \u00a7 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989, which came into force in respect of Switzerland on 26 March 1997, read as follows:\nArticle 3\n\u201cIn all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\u201d\n28. The principle of \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests\u201d, which stems from the second principle of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child adopted by the United Nations on 20 November 1959, is also embodied in Articles 5 and 16 of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and was referred to in relation to other international treaties, inter alia, in General Comments Nos. 17 and 19 of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. For a more in-depth discussion of the concept of the \u201cchild\u2019s best interests\u201d, see Neulinger and Shuruk v. Switzerland [GC], no. 41615/07, \u00a7\u00a7 49-55, ECHR 2010.\n#### B.

Article 11 of the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation of 1999, entitled \u201cProtection of children and young people\u201d, provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Children and young people have the right to the special protection of their integrity and to the encouragement of their development. ...\u201d\n##### 2.

Prior to 1 January 2008 family reunification of children of foreign nationality with a parent living in Switzerland was governed by the Residence of Foreign Nationals Act of 26 March 1931 (Bundesgesetz \u00fcber Aufenthalt und Niederlassung der Ausl\u00e4nder, ANAG).\n31. Article 17 \u00a7 2 third sentence of the Residence of Foreign Nationals Act provided that unmarried children of foreigners who had a permanent residence permit in Switzerland had a right to be included in that permanent residence permit, if they lived together with the parents and were under 18 years of age. This provision applied by analogy to foreign children of Swiss nationals (see, among others, Federal Supreme Court, no. 2 A 457/2003, judgment of 16 January 2004, BGE 130 II 137).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n24. Pursuant to Article 56 \u00a7 1 of the Family and Guardianship Code (Kodeks rodzinny i opieku\u0144czy), either spouse may file a petition for divorce if there has been a complete and irretrievable marriage breakdown (zupe\u0142ny i trwa\u0142y rozk\u0142ad po\u017cycia). For the purposes of establishing whether a complete breakdown has occurred, the established judicial practice is to examine ex officio whether the financial, emotional and sexual ties between the spouses have ended (Supreme Court decision no. III CKN 386/98 of 22 October 1999, and Katowice Court of Appeal decision no. I ACa 51/10 of 12 March 2010). The courts establish it applying the general procedural rules governing the taking of evidence, in addition to certain specific rules provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure for the purposes of divorce proceedings.\n25. In particular, under Article 431 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a decision in a divorce case cannot be based exclusively on the admission of the claim or of certain facts by the respondent. Article 432 of the Code provides that both parties to a divorce case are to be heard in person. Under Article 442, if the respondent admits the divorce claim and the spouses have no minor children, the court may limit the taking of evidence to hearing the parties.\n26. Under Article 56 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Family and Guardianship Code, a divorce may not be granted even where there has been a complete breakdown of the marriage, if:\n\u201c(2) ... it would be detrimental to the well-being of [the] minor children [of the marriage] or if, for other reasons, granting the divorce would be contrary to the principles of social coexistence (zasady wsp\u00f3\u0142\u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego);\n(3) ... it has been requested by the spouse who is at fault for the breakdown of the marriage, unless the other spouse has expressed his or her consent thereto, or the refusal of such consent by the other spouse is \u2013 in the circumstances at issue \u2013 contrary to the reasonable principles of social coexistence...\u201d\n27. Article 5 of the Civil Code reads:\n\u201cNo one shall exercise any right of his in a manner contrary to its socio-economic purpose or to the principles of social coexistence (zasady wsp\u00f3\u0142\u017cycia spo\u0142ecznego). An act or omission [fulfilling this description] on the part of the holder of the right shall not be deemed to be the exercise of the right and shall be protected [by law].\u201d\n28. The courts have developed ample case-law addressing situations where a respondent spouse refuses to consent to a divorce. In particular, they have held that an innocent respondent has a right to refuse to consent. A presumption of good faith was therefore applicable to such a refusal, until it was demonstrated, with reference to the specific circumstances of a case, that the refusal ran counter to the principles of social coexistence within the meaning of Article 5 of the Civil Code (Supreme Court decision nos. II CKN 956/99 of 26 October 2002 and I CKN 305/01 of 26 February 2000). In particular, the respondent spouse\u2019s intention to frustrate the petitioner\u2019s plans to formalise his or her extramarital relationship should not, by itself, be regarded as being incompatible with these principles, if it has been shown that the refusal was inspired by a wish to continue the marriage, consistent with ethical and social standards (Supreme Court decision no. CKN 305/01 of 26 February 2002).\n29. The courts are obliged to assess whether or not a refusal to consent to a divorce amounts to an abuse of rights in the light of the spouses\u2019 situation and conditions caused by the breakdown of their marriage, both of the innocent respondent and the petitioner. It is only in the light of these findings that a thorough assessment can be made whether a refusal is consonant with universally accepted morality rules (regu\u0142y moralno\u015bci) and whether or not it is detrimental to other interests worthy of legal protection (Supreme Court decision no. I CKN 871/00 of 4 October 2001). The factors to be taken into account include, inter alia, the spouses\u2019 health, age and ability to earn a living and the length of the marriage (Supreme Court decision nos. I CR 565/57 of 22 May 1958 and III CKN 573/98 of 9 October 1998, and Bia\u0142ystok Court of Appeal decision no. I ACa 48/97 of 6 March 1997). The fact that the petitioner has children born from an extramarital relationship is also of relevance (Supreme Court decision no. C 1115/52 of 8 July 1952).\n30. The refusal of an innocent spouse should be overridden if it is shown that the respondent is motivated merely by a wish to harass the petitioner and to prevent him or her from formalising his or her new relationship (Supreme Court decision no. III CKN 665/00 of 21 November 2002).\n31. The respondent\u2019s conduct after the marriage breakdown also has to be taken into consideration; if it is spiteful and reprehensible, the refusal of consent can be overridden (Supreme Court decision no. II CKN 1270/00 of 21 March 2003). Likewise, the causes of the breakdown and the circumstances which have arisen thereafter, including the existence of other relationships and extramarital children, have to be taken into consideration by the court (Supreme Court decision no. III CKN 1032/99 of 10 May 2000).\nTHE LAW\nALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 8 AND 12 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant complained under Articles 8 and 12 of the Convention that by refusing to grant him a divorce the authorities had prevented him from marrying the woman with whom he had been living.\n33. The relevant provisions read as follows:\nArticle 8\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life ... .\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\nArticle 12\n\u201cMen and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n34. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s complaint fell outside the scope of Article 12 and was incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. The applicant disagreed.\n35. The Court finds that the Government\u2019s objection is closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaints and should be joined to the merits of the case.\n36. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n37.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts). At the hearing in the present case, the Government indicated that there were on that date 56 prisoners serving whole life sentences. No prisoner in this category has been released since the date of the Vinter judgment.\n#### A. The Human Rights Act 1998\n14. The Human Rights Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201cSection 2 - Interpretation of Convention rights.\n(1) A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any\u2014\n(a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights,\n...\nSection 3 - Interpretation of legislation.\n(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\n...\nSection 6 - Acts of public authorities.\n(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\u2014\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\n(3) In this section \u201cpublic authority\u201d includes\u2014\n(a) a court or tribunal, and\n(b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,\nbut does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.\n...\nSection 7 - Proceedings.\n(1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may\u2014\n(a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or\n(b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,\nbut only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.\n...\nSection 8 - Judicial remedies.\n(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\n...\u201d\n#### B. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997\n15. Section 30 of the Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\u201d\n#### C. Prison Service Order 4700\n16. The policy of the Secretary of State for Justice on the exercise of the power of release on compassionate grounds is set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued as Prison Service Order 4700. The criteria, as formulated in April 2010, provide as follows:\n\u201cthe prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stoke;\nand\nthe risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\nfurther imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\nthere are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\nearly release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family\u201d.\n#### D. Court of Appeal decision in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin\n17. A special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear these appeals, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge. It gave its decision (\u201cMcLoughlin\u201d) on 18 February 2014, in light of the judgment of this Court in the Vinter case.\n18. The appellant Newell challenged as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention the whole life order imposed on him for a murder committed while he was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder. The McLoughlin case took the form of a reference by the Attorney General under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1986, who contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The trial judge had instead imposed a life sentence with a tariff of forty years for a murder committed by a man with previous convictions for murder and manslaughter.\n19. In its decision, the Court of Appeal traced the development of the whole life sentence and the review of such sentences. It stated at paragraph 7 (citations omitted):\n\u201ci) On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (...).\n\u201cIn addition, I have decided that for those life sentence prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by their remaining in prison for the whole of their life, there will in future be an additional ministerial review when the prisoner has been in custody for 25 years. The purpose of this review will be solely to consider whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a tariff of a determinate period. The review will be confined to the considerations of retribution and deterrence. Where appropriate, further ministerial reviews will normally take place at five-yearly intervals thereafter. Existing prisoners who fall into this category and who have already served 25 years or more in custody will not be disadvantaged. Their cases will be reviewed by ministers as soon as is practicable and after any representations they may wish to make.\u201d\nii) That policy was modified by a different Home Secretary on 10 November 1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written answer):\n\u201cSo far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.\u201d\niii) In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley [...] that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was unlawful, this had been corrected by the 1997 policy which permitted the taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison. In the appeal to the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of exceptional circumstances (...) Lord Steyn, when approving the legality of the Home Secretary\u2019s 1997 policy, recorded the way in which the policy had been clarified (...):\n\u201c.... counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the policy of imposing a whole life tariff merely involves the expression of the current view of the Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution and deterrence make it inappropriate ever to release such a prisoner. It does not rule out reconsideration. The Secretary of State envisages the possibility of release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of State is prepared to reconsider any whole life tariff decision from time to time.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal then set out the relevant criteria of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), commenting that these were \u201chighly restrictive\u201d (paragraph 11 of the McLoughlin decision). It raised the question whether the statutory scheme was compatible with Article 3. In answering the question, it stated:\n\u201c(b) Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life order is imposed?\n19. The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self-evident, that there is no violation of Article 3 if a prisoner in fact spends the whole of his life in prison. One example is an offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life.\n20. However, the Grand Chamber considered that the justification for detention might shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might cease to be just after the passage of many years. It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of its judgment that for a life sentence to be compatible with Article 3, there must therefore be both a prospect of release and a possibility of review. It added at paragraph 122:\n\u201cA whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d\n21. It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124:\n\u201cHowever, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.\u201d\n22. Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a whole life order as just punishment, it concluded that a legal regime for a review during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed.\n23. Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the Strasbourg Court did not determine that the imposition of a whole life tariff itself violates Article 3, we return briefly to the arguments advanced contingently on the hypothesis that it did. In our judgment section 3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs. That is because section 269(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion that no order for early release should be made because of the seriousness of the offence alone or in combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply. That being so, section 6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public authority to act compatibly with the Convention.\n24. The only remedy available in the domestic courts on this hypothesis would be a declaration of incompatibility, the discretionary remedy available under section 4 of the Human Rights Act when primary legislation is found to be incompatible with the Convention.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. The Children Born outside Marriage (Legal Status) Act of 19 August 1969, which came into force on 1 July 1970, provided that on the father\u2019s death, children born outside marriage after 1 July 1949 \u2013 shortly after the entry into force of the Basic Law \u2013 were entitled to compensation from the heirs in an amount equivalent to their share of the estate (Erbersatzanspruch). The sole exception concerned children born outside marriage before 1 July 1949: the first sentence of section 12(10)(2) of the Act excluded them from any statutory entitlement to the estate and from the right to financial compensation.\n16. With regard to further relevant domestic law and practice, the Court refers to its judgment in Brauer v. Germany (no. 3545/04, \u00a7\u00a7 17 to 24, 28 May 2009).\nTHE LAW\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Detention pending deportation\n25. The power to detain a person pending deportation is contained in Paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971 (\u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d), (for details see V.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 49734/12, \u00a7 52, 1 September 2016).\n#### B. Challenges to detention\n26. In the United Kingdom, a person in immigration detention may at any time bring an application for judicial review in order to challenge the \u201clawfulness\u201d and Article 5 \u00a7 1(f) compliance of his detention. In considering any such application, the domestic courts must apply the Hardial Singh principles. These principles require that detention be for the purpose of exercising the power to deport; the period of detention must be reasonable in all the circumstances; a detainee must be released if it becomes apparent that deportation cannot be effected within a reasonable period; and the authorities must act with due diligence and expedition to effect removal.\n27. Failing compliance with the requisite conditions, the detention becomes unlawful under domestic law, with the attendant obligation on the authorities to release the individual. The test applied by the United Kingdom courts has been considered almost identical to that applied by this Court under Article 5 \u00a7 1(f) of the Convention in determining whether or not detention has become \u201carbitrary\u201d (see J.N. v. the United Kingdom, no. 37289/12, \u00a7 97, 19 May 2016).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 (f) OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that his detention from 8 February 2008 to 13 July 2011 fell short of the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201d\n29 The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n30. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n31. The applicant submitted that the domestic law governing administrative detention of immigrants for the purposes of expulsion was not sufficiently precise, accessible and foreseeable in its consequences to meet the standard of lawfulness and, as such, it lacked the quality of law necessary to deprive him of his liberty.\n32.

Article 160 of the CCP obliges the public prosecution office to investigate suspected criminal offences as soon as it obtains knowledge of them.\n22. Article 161 \u00a7 1 of the CCP, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cFor the purpose indicated in Article 160 ..., the public prosecution office shall be entitled to request information from all authorities and conduct investigations of any kind, either itself or through the authorities and officials in the police force, provided there are no other statutory provisions specifically regulating their powers.\u201d\n23. Pursuant to Article 161a of the CCP, witnesses are obliged to appear before the public prosecution office and make a statement. Articles 51 and 70 of the CCP specify that witnesses who refuse to testify without legal reason can be charged with the costs attributable to this refusal, and that they can be detained for up to six months in order to force them to testify.\n24. Article 94 of the CCP, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201c(1) Objects which may be of importance as evidence for the investigation shall be impounded or otherwise secured.\n(2) Such objects shall be seized if in a person\u2019s possession and not surrendered voluntarily.\u201d\n25. Article 95 of the CCP reads:\n\u201c(1) A person who has in his possession an object of the kind mentioned above [in Article 94] shall be obliged to produce it and surrender it upon request.\n(2) In the event of non-compliance, the regulatory and coercive measures set out in Article 70 may be used against that person [who has failed to comply]. This shall not apply to persons who are entitled to refuse to testify.\u201d\n#### B. Protection of lawyers and the lawyer-client privilege\n26. Article 53 of the CCP, in so far as relevant, reads:\n\u201c(1) The following persons may also refuse to testify:\n...\n2. defence counsel for the accused, in relation to information which was entrusted to them or became known to them in this capacity;\n3. lawyers, ... in relation to information which was entrusted to them or became known to them in this capacity.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Municipal by-laws\n15. In Belgium the wearing of the full-face veil was first banned by municipal by-laws passed by a number of municipalities among which were the provisions being challenged in the instant case (see paragraph 10 above).\n#### B. The Law of 1 June 2011\n16. A Law prohibiting the wearing of any clothing entirely or substantially concealing the face was enacted on 1 June 2011 and came into force on 23 July 2011.\n17. The relevant provisions of the Law of 1 June 2011 are worded as follows:\n\u201cArt. 2. Article 563bis, worded as follows, shall be inserted into the Criminal Code:\nArt. 563bis. Unless otherwise provided by law, persons who appear in a place that is accessible to the public with their faces completely or partially covered or hidden, such as not to be identifiable, shall be liable to a fine of between fifteen and twenty-five euros [read: between 120 and 200 euros] and imprisonment of between one and seven days, or to one of those penalties alone.\nHowever, paragraph 1 hereof shall not concern persons who are present in a place that is accessible to the public with their faces completely or partially covered or hidden, such as not to be unidentifiable, where this is provided for by employment regulations or by an administrative ordinance in connection with festive events.\u201d\n18. In judgment no. 145/2012 of 6 December 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed applications for judicial review of the Law of 1 June 2011, whilst setting out an interpretative reservation in respect of the Law concerning places of worship.\n19. With regard to the background to the Law and its aims, the Constitutional Court made the following observations:\n\u201cB.4.2. The authors of the bill [which led to the enactment of the impugned Law] sought to endorse a societal model where the individual took precedence over his or her philosophical, cultural or religious ties. Accordingly, they recommended a ban on wearing clothing designed to fully or substantially conceal one\u2019s face in public places, stressing the fact that the ban was not based only on public-order considerations but more fundamentally on social considerations, which were crucial, in the view of the authors of the bill, to the notion of \u2018living together\u2019 in a society which sought to emancipate its members and protect the rights of each and every one of them (Doc. parl., Chamber, 2009-2010, DOC 52-2289/001, p. 5, and Doc. parl., Chamber, S.E. 2010, DOC 53-0219/001, p. 5).\u201d\n20. Regarding the public-safety and legal aim, the Constitutional Court found as follows:\n\u201cIn so far as anyone present in public thoroughfares or in a public place must be identifiable, wearing clothing which completely conceals the face poses obvious problems in terms of public safety.\nIn order to ban conduct of that type, many municipalities have enacted by-laws with a view to banning the wearing of such clothing, while permitting exemptions from the rules at specific events. However, the court cannot but note that, in one and the same city, certain municipalities do not prescribe the same bans. Those differences in regime result in a form of untenable legal uncertainty for citizens and for the authorities responsible for punishing that type of conduct.\nThe authors of the bill therefore recommend that the question be determined at federal level so that the same rule applies throughout the country (Doc. parl., Chamber, 2009-2010, DOC52-2289/001, pp.5-6, and Doc. parl., Chamber, S.E.2010, DOC 53-0219/001, pp. 5-6).\u201d\n21. As to whether the ban on wearing the veil met a pressing social need and was proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by the legislature, the Constitutional Court found as follows:\n\u201cB.17.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The detention order\n24. Articles 112 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure concern detention on remand. By virtue of Article 112 \u00a7 1 of the Code, a defendant may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he has committed a criminal offence and if there are grounds for arresting him. Grounds for arrest will, for example, exist where certain facts warrant the conclusion that there is a risk of his absconding (Article 112 \u00a7 2 no. 2) or reoffending (Article 112a \u00a7 1). Article 112a \u00a7 2 of the Code and the constant case-law of the domestic courts provide that a detention order cannot be based on a risk of reoffending, including by way of subsidiarity, if the prerequisites for issuing an arrest warrant due to a risk of absconding are met while the prerequisites for staying its execution are not met (see Gera Regional Court, 1 Qs 11/00, decision of 3 April 2000; Berlin Court of Appeal, (4) 1 HEs 199/99 (132/99), decision of 13 October 1999; Bonn Regional Court, 32 Qs 99/88, decision of 20 July 1988).\n25. Should a detention order nonetheless be based on a risk of reoffending in such a scenario, including by way of subsidiarity, the risk of reoffending would either not be taken into account as a ground for arrest (see Berlin Court of Appeal, 5 Ws 12/16, decision of 8 February 2016) or be cancelled (see Hamm Court of Appeal, 3 Ws 412/09, decision of 3 November 2009). Such a detention order is defective in law (rechtsfehlerhaft), but not void (unwirksam/nichtig) and remains a valid basis for detention (see further Mooren v. Germany [GC], no. 11364/03, \u00a7\u00a7 48\u201149, 9 July 2009).\n26. Under domestic law, a person is detained on remand until his conviction becomes final, including during appeal procedures.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. Under domestic law, a person is detained on remand, rather than after conviction, until his or her conviction becomes final, including during appeal procedures. Remand prisoners may, under Article 117 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, at any time seek a review (Haftpr\u00fcfung) of their detention or ask for a stay of execution. They may lodge an appeal under Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Haftbeschwerde) against a decision ordering their (continued) detention with the court that took it. If the court does not allow the appeal, it refers it to a higher court. A further appeal may be lodged against the decision of that court (weitere Beschwerde) under Article 310 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n22. According to the case-law of the domestic courts, only the most recent detention order can be subject to a review (see, among many other authorities, Federal Constitutional Court, 2 BvR 332/05, decision of 12 May 2005, paragraph 14, and D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal, MDR 1969, 779).\n23. Article 33a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which governs subsequent hearings, provides:\n\u201cIf, in a ruling, the court violates the right of a participant to be heard in a manner which might affect the outcome of the case and if the participant has no right to lodge a complaint or any other legal remedy against the ruling, then as far as the detriment still exists the court shall make an order either proprio motu or on application reverting the proceedings to the situation before the decision in question was given.

Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention reads as follows:\n\u201c4.

The applicant submitted that, according to the case-law of the Court, proceedings under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention must be adversarial and always ensure equality of arms between the parties. Relying on Lanz v. Austria (no. 24430/94, \u00a7\u00a7 40-42, 31 January 2002), he argued that the prosecutor and the detainee must always be given the opportunity to note observations filed by the other party and comment on them, including on appeal. Where observations were not served on the other party, the proceedings were not truly adversarial. In that regard it was irrelevant that, in the opinion of the courts concerned, the observations had not contained any new facts or arguments and whether the observations had actually had an effect on the decision of the court.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n42. The applicant complained that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 30 September 2011, rejecting her appeal against the judicial order requiring her to give evidence about her contacts with Mr X, had given rise to an unjustified interference with her right not to be compelled to disclose her journalistic sources as inherent in Article 10 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n43. The Government disputed that there had been a violation of that provision.\n#### A. Admissibility\n44. The applicant appealed against the City Court\u2019s ruling of 15 February 2011 about her duty to testify before the High Court and the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 13, 18 and 19 above). She did not appeal against the High Court\u2019s decision of 25 January 2012 ordering her to pay a fine because of her refusal to testify about her contact with Mr X (see paragraph 35 above). The Government have understood the application as addressing the order to give evidence. The Court is of the same view and simply notes that the issue of non-exhaustion has not been raised by the Government.\n45. As regards, specifically, the impugned order to give evidence, the Court notes that the case does not appear before it in entirely the same way as it did before the Supreme Court. The applicant\u2019s appeal to the Supreme Court was directed against the High Court\u2019s assessment of evidence and the application of the law. The parties\u2019 submissions before the Supreme Court and the reasoning of that court concerned primarily the interpretation and applicability of the first paragraph of Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 19 to 33 above).\n46. At the same time, the Court has taken account of the fact that the Supreme Court did examine in substance whether the order to give evidence could be upheld in the light of Article 10 of the Convention, based on arguments by the parties, including arguments relating to the proportionality test under the second paragraph of that provision. The Supreme Court accordingly examined relevant factors such as the conduct of the source, the seriousness of the criminal case and the degree to which testimony from the applicant would assist in that case (see paragraph 26 above).\n47. Finding that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds, it must be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n48. The applicant submitted that the decision ordering her to reveal her source was an interference under Article 10 which was not prescribed by law.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Relevant domestic law\n31. The relevant provisions of the Labour Code (Law no. 1475), as in force during the relevant period and as applicable to the dispute before the domestic courts, read as follows:\nArticle 35\n\u201cOvertime pay\n...\na) Overtime shall not exceed three hours a day,\nb) The total amount of overtime in a year cannot exceed 90 working days,\nc) Each hour of overtime shall be remunerated at one and a half times the regular hourly rate.\n...\nd) Overtime work is subject to authorisation beforehand by the Regional Directorate of Labour.\n...\u201d\nArticle 61\n\u201cWorking time\na) The maximum working time is forty-five hours a week.\nWhere six days a week are worked in a workplace, the daily working time shall not exceed 7.5 hours ...\u201d\nArticle 62\n\u201cPeriods considered as hours of work\n...\nc) times when the employee has no work to perform pending the arrival of new work, but remains at the employer\u2019s disposal.\u201d\nArticle 64\n\u201cEmployees shall be entitled to rest periods ... in accordance with customary work practices in the following manner:\n...\nc) one hour [break] for work which lasts more than seven and a half hours.\n...\nAbove-mentioned rest periods are not counted as working time.\u201d\n32. The relevant provisions in the applicants\u2019 collective bargaining agreement provided as follows:\n\u201cArticle 22 - Working Time\n...\nRest breaks are counted as worked time and such rest periods may not be deducted from employee\u2019s wages.\u201d\n\u201cArticle 25 \u2013 Overtime\n...\nHours worked beyond the forty-five hour work week is overtime.\n...\nOvertime is remunerated one and half times the regular hourly rate. \u201d\n33. A distinction is made in Turkish labour law jurisprudence between mandatory labour code provisions which are absolute and those which can be changed in favour of employees. Accordingly, parties cannot derogate from rules that are of an absolutely mandatory nature, whereas it is accepted in respect of some of the rules that individual and collective agreements can provide for terms that are more favourable for employees than those in the Labour Code. Accordingly, provisions relating to rest periods are mandatory and parties may not derogate from them, however, they may lay down more favourable rules.\n#### B. Relevant domestic case-law\n34. The presumption that only fourteen hours can be accepted as actual working time in places where a single shift consists of twenty-four hours was first established by the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation\u2019s Civil Division (Yarg\u0131tay Hukuk Genel Kurulu) in decision no. E.2006/9\u2011107, K.2006/144. It was issued on 5 April 2006 in a case concerning a dispute about overtime pay for security workers who worked twenty\u2011four\u2011hour shifts at a radio relay station. As with the present applicants, the security workers also operated on the basis of continuous work of twenty-four hours and time off for the subsequent twenty-four hours. The Court of Cassation found it established in that case that the workers had not worked continuously for that period as they had been paired up by the employer to allow one person to work and the other to rest. According to the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation\u2019s Civil Division, that arrangement meant that each worker spent an average of twelve hours on duty, of which one hour had in any case to be set aside for the mandatory rest period.

An allegation shall not be punishable if its truth has been established or if the author of the allegation has in good faith been under an obligation to speak or has acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or of the personal interest of himself or of others.\n2.

This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.

The Court notes that all the applicants complained of the alleged denial by the authorities of their right to education and the interference with their freedom of expression on account of the disciplinary sanctions imposed on them for having petitioned the relevant authorities to provide optional Kurdish language courses in their universities. Accordingly, in view of the similarity between the applications in terms of the facts and the substantive issues they raise, it decides to join them and to examine them together in a single judgment in accordance with Rule 42 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court.\n### II.

Turkey, no. 36458/02, \u00a7 28, 3 March 2009). The relevant part of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 reads:\n\u201cNo person shall be denied the right to education.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n34. The Government argued that the applicants were not victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. They pointed out that the disciplinary sanctions imposed on the applicants by the University had been annulled by the domestic courts and that following the first-instance courts\u2019 decisions to stay the execution of the impugned sanctions the applicants had been able to effectively attend their courses and sit their exams. In this connection, they considered that the applicants had abused the right of petition because they had failed to mention the latter fact in their application forms.\n35. The applicants rejected the Governments arguments. In particular, they submitted that following their petitions the applicants had been exposed in the university environment as members of an illegal organization and that their social relationships with their families and friends had deteriorated, as they were regarded as terrorists. They further maintained that when they returned to the University a few months later, other students had advanced, and that since the administration had not enabled them to take the classes they had", "001-179422": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF L\u00d3PEZ ELORZA v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Constitutional and statutory provisions\n##### 1. The Constitution\n42. The relevant provisions of the Spanish Constitution read as follows:\nArticle 10\n\u201c1. Human dignity, inviolable and inherent rights, the free development of the personality, and respect for the law and for the rights of others are the foundation of political order and social peace.\n2. The principles relating to the fundamental rights and liberties recognised by the Constitution shall be interpreted in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international treaties and agreements thereon ratified by Spain.\u201d\nArticle 15\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to life and to physical and moral integrity, and may under no circumstances be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. The death penalty is hereby abolished, except as provided by military criminal law in times of war.\u201d\n##### 2. Extradition Act no. 4/1985 of 21 March\n43. Under section 1, extradition is only possible between Spain and foreign States under a treaty concluded on a mutual basis.\n44. Under section 4(6), extradition may not be granted if the requesting State does not personally guarantee that the person will not be executed or subjected to a punishment amounting to inhuman and/or degrading treatment.\n45. In accordance with section 7, the extradition request must be lodged with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a diplomatic note or directly with the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice then issues its recommendations on the request and sends it to the Government, which decides on the continuation of the proceedings (section 9).\n46. Under section 12, if the Government decide on the continuation of the proceedings, the request will be sent to the competent judge.\n47. Sections 14 and 15 provide that after investigatory proceedings and a hearing the judge decides whether to grant or deny the request. The decision is open to appeal (recurso de s\u00faplica) before the Plenary of the Criminal Division of the Audiencia Nacional.\n48. Section 18 states that if the domestic courts grant the extradition request, it will be sent back to the Government, which ultimately decides whether or not to hand the person over to the requesting State.\n##### 3. Extradition agreement between Spain and the United States\n49. A treaty on extradition between Spain and the United States was signed in Madrid on 29 May 1970. It was amended and updated by additional treaties of 25 January 1975, 9 February 1988 and 12 March 1996 and by the 25 June 2003 agreement between the European Union and the United States on extradition under a bilateral \u201cinstrument\u201d of 18 January 2010.\n50. Article 2 of the 29 May 1970 agreement as amended reads as follows:\n\u201cA. An offense shall be an extraditable offense if it is punishable under the laws in both Contracting Parties by deprivation of liberty for a period of more than one year or by a more severe penalty, or in the case of a sentenced person, if the sentence imposed was greater than four months.\n#### B. Extradition shall also be granted for participation in any of these offenses, not only as principals or accomplices, but as accessories, as well as for attempts to commit or conspiracy to commit any of the aforementioned offenses, when such participation, attempt or conspiracy is subject, under the laws of both Parties, to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\n#### C. For the purposes of this Article, an offense shall be an extraditable offense whether or not the laws in the Contracting States place the offense within the same category of offenses or describe the offense by the same terminology.\n...\u201d.\n#### B. Relevant United States law\n##### 1. Pre-trial factors affecting sentencing\n51. In accordance with section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the US Code, there are several factors to be considered in imposing a sentence:\n18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3553 - Imposition of a sentence\n\u201c(a) Factors To Be Considered in Imposing a Sentence. \u2014The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained under Article 3 of the Convention that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during his time in police custody. In that connection, he claimed that he had been blindfolded, beaten and subjected to Palestinian hanging and had received electric shocks to his genitals several times. He further alleged that the medical examinations had not been conducted diligently and that his complaints had not been taken into account by the domestic authorities.\n27. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted the domestic remedies in that he had not brought a case before the administrative courts with regard to his allegations of ill-treatment. They further maintained that the applicant had failed to comply with the six\u2011month time-limit, arguing that he should have brought his complaint under Article 3 before the Court within six months after 28 March 2001, the day his police custody had ended.

The applicant claimed to be the victim of a breach of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 (d) of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3-d) which provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by a ... tribunal ...\n2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\n3.

THE APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)\n29. The Government's principal submission was that Article 6 (art. 6) was not applicable in the present case since no criminal charge existed at any time or, at least, at the time when the decision at issue was rendered. This view was not shared by the Commission and was contested by the applicant.\n30.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 May and 25 September 1989,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The system under the Building Act 1947\n##### 1. Legislation on construction and urban planning\n23. Until 1 July 1987 a property owner\u2019s rights to erect buildings on his property were regulated by the Building Act 1947 and the Building Ordinance 1959 (byggnadsstadgan - \u201cthe 1959 Ordinance\u201c) which was issued by the Government in accordance with powers conferred on them by the 1947 Act.\n24. Section 1 of the 1947 Act provided that constructions on a property required a building permit to the extent laid down by the Government. Section 54 of the 1959 Ordinance specified that a permit was required for all new constructions (see paragraphs 37-39 below) except for the construction of certain buildings for public use, and small additions to existing residences and farms.\n25. Before a building could be erected on a property, section 5 of the 1947 Act called for an examination of whether the property was suitable from a general point of view for this purpose. Such an examination was to be effected by planning procedure, except for non-urban areas where it could be made when an application for a building permit was under consideration.\n##### 2. Plans and regulations\n26. A master plan (generalplan) was drawn up by the municipality concerned in so far as this was required in order to establish a framework for more detailed plans. Complete master plans were seldom deemed necessary. Instead, municipalities tended to meet their planning needs by using simpler, less detailed plans, usually described as area plans (omr\u00e5desplan). Such plans were not governed by law.\n27. Town plans (stadsplan) were prepared for those urban areas in which this was deemed necessary (section 24). A town plan was more detailed than a master plan: it indicated the purposes for which the various areas could be utilised - housing, roads, squares, parks, etc. - and it also included specific provisions on their use (section 25).\n28. Building plans (byggnadsplan) were established for areas which had become densely populated without, however, requiring the detailed regulations provided for in a town plan.\n29. After adoption by the Municipal Assembly, town and building plans had to be approved by the County Administrative Board. In the course of this procedure, property owners had a number of opportunities to submit their views.\n30. If a municipality failed to adopt a town or a building plan, the Government could order it to do so within a certain time-limit.\n31. Subdivision plans (avstyckningsplan) were old plans which only set out the borders between land intended for building and land intended for public use. These plans did not regulate the details of building itself.\nW", "001-57441": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BOD\u00c9N v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Town-planning law\n13. The Building Act 1947 (byggnadslagen 1947:385 - \u201cthe 1947 Act\u201c) is the main legal instrument governing planning in respect of the use of land for construction and urban development. It provides for the drawing up of a master plan (generalplan), which establishes within a municipality the framework for other and more detailed plans, namely city plans (stadsplaner) and building plans (byggnadsplaner).\nAs in the present case, a municipal council may draw up an area plan, instead of a master plan. The manner in which area plans are elaborated and their content are not expressly governed by the 1947 Act but general principles of administrative law are, of course, applicable.\n#### B. Legislation on the issue of expropriation permits\n14. The issue of expropriation permits is governed by the 1972 Act. Under Chapter 3, section 1, such a permit is normally granted by the Government.\nFor cases like the present, the grounds justifying the issue of a permit are stated in Chapter 2, section 1, of the 1972 Act (as amended by the Act of 1976:46), which reads as follows (translation from Swedish):\n\u201cExpropriation is allowed in order to enable a municipality to acquire rights over land which is needed, as a result of future societal requirements, for urban development (t\u00e4tbebyggelse) or constructions in connection with such development. ...

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 and 30 October and 24 November 1987 and 24 March 1988,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. General legal framework\n21. The prison system in Scotland is governed by the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1952 (\u201cthe 1952 Act\u201c). Under sections 1 and 3 of the 1952 Act, general control and superintendance over prisons in Scotland are vested in the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nSection 35(1) of the 1952 Act empowers the Secretary of State to \u201cmake rules for the regulation and management of prisons ... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein\u201c. This power is exercisable by statutory instrument. A draft of any statutory instrument made under section 35 has to be laid before Parliament (section 40). Statutory instruments are categorised by domestic law as subordinate legislation (section 1 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946). Subordinate legislation is recognised at common law to have the full force and effect of legislation made by the Sovereign in Parliament (see Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 4th ed., vol. 44, para. 981). Statutory instruments such as the Prison Rules are made public.\nIn exercise of his powers under section 35 of the 1952 Act, the Secretary of State has made the Prison (Scotland) Rules 1952 (Statutory Instrument 1952/565) (\u201cthe Prison Rules\u201c), which have been amended periodically.\nIn supplement of the Prison Rules, the Secretary of State, in the exercise of his general jurisdiction over prisons and of various powers conferred in the Prison Rules themselves, issues instructions to the Governors of prisons by way of administrative orders referred to as \u201cStanding Orders\u201c. At the relevant time, the text of the Standing Orders themselves was not made public. However, an Abstract of Rules and Regulations for Convicted Prisoners (\u201cthe Abstract\u201c) containing information about the content of the Prison Rules and Standing Orders was made available to convicted prisoners.\n#### B. Correspondence\n22. Rule 74 of the Prison Rules provides, inter alia:\n\u201c(2) Every prisoner shall be allowed to write and to receive a letter on his admission, and shall thereafter be allowed to write and to receive letters and to receive visits at intervals laid down by the Secretary of State. The intervals so prescribed may be extended as a punishment for misconduct, but shall not be extended so as to preclude a prisoner from writing and receiving a letter, and receiving a visit, every eight weeks.\n...\n(4) Subject to the provisions of Rule 50(4) every letter to or from a prisoner shall be read by the Governor or by an officer deputed by him for that purpose and it shall be within the discretion of the Governor to stop any letter if he considers that the contents are objectionable.\u201c\nAt the relevant time, these provisions were supplemented by Standing Orders Ic.1 to 4.\n##### 1. Payment of postage\n23. Thus, Standing Order Ic.2(3) specified:\n\u201cPrisoners will be granted the privilege of writing letters on the following scale:\n(a) All convicted prisoners ... are allowed to write one letter each week to their relatives and friends, the postage of which will be paid out of public funds. ...\n...\n(d) Postage of additional letters may be met from earnings; the use of private cash from sources other than earnings should not be allowed for this purpose. Before an inmate is allowed to write extra letters he should submit for the Governor\u2019s approval a list of persons with whom he intends to correspond. Additions to or deletions from the list will be at the Governor\u2019s discretion.\n...\u201c\nNo limit was placed on the number of additional letters that might be sent. The content of the relevant provisions of the Standing Orders was made known to prisoners in paragraph 23 of the Abstract.\n##### 2. Screening of correspondence\n24. Standing Order Ic.1(1)(a) dealt with the reading of correspondence under Prison Rule 74(4) (see paragraph 22 above):\n\u201cIn the case of the great majority of letters, where neither the prisoner nor his offence is of notoriety, and the correspondent is a wife or near relative, it is not necessary that every letter should be read through. It will usually suffice to glance at the contents and see they are of usual domestic and personal nature. There will, however, always be certain prisoners whose correspondence requires to be thoroughly examined, and it will be for the Governor to settle who these are and to instruct the officer who deals with the letters accordingly.\u201c\nStanding Order Ic.4(9) further provided (as regards incoming mail):\n\u201cIn no circumstances should the contents of a letter to a prisoner or inmate be referred to in the hearing of another inmate.\u201c\n##### 3. Stopping of letters\n25. Standing Order Ic.1(3) dealt with the exercise of the Governor\u2019s discretion under Rule 74(4) to stop \u201cobjectionable\u201c letters. It stated:\n\u201cAll ordinary matter, including news of public events, should be passed. Comment by a prisoner on his own conviction and sentence is not objectionable if expressed in proper terms. Objectionable matter falls within narrow limits, viz.\n...\n(c) Matter intended for insertion in the Press, for publication or for use on wireless or television (with the exception of the magazine \u2018Linkup\u2019).\n...\u201c\nSince the relevant time, new Standing Orders on prisoners\u2019 correspondence have been introduced in Scotland in light of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 judgment of 25 March 1983 in the case of Silver and Others (Series A no. 61). The restrictions on correspondence formerly applicable have been considerably relaxed, including in particular the prohibition on letters intended for publication. These new provisions relating to correspondence (Standing Order M, which also concerns visits) are available to prisoners.\n#### C. Visits in prison\n26.

The applicant\u2019s complaint concerned the length of the proceedings he brought before the German courts. he invoked Articles 6 par. 1, 8, 3 and 12 (art. 6-1, art. 8, art. 3, art. 12) of the Convention.\n##### 1. The alleged breach of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention\n45. The Commission came to the conclusion that there had been a breach of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...\u201c\nThe Government disagreed with this opinion.\n46. One point has not been put in issue and the Court takes it for granted: the \u201cright\u201c being claimed by Mr, Buchholz was a \u201ccivil right\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1). Accordingly, the sole question to be settled is whether or not the \u201creasonable time\u201c was exceeded.\n47. The Court must first specify the period to be taken into account.\nMr. Buchholz\u2019s application was directed against the proceedings carried on before the three levels of German labour courts from 10 July 1974 onwards (see paragraph 13 above) and subsequently before the Federal Constitutional Court.\nThe Commission considered that the latter set of proceedings was not relevant.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n19. According to Chapter 21 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, lower courts shall as a rule render judgment in criminal cases only after the accused has been able to defend himself at an oral hearing. Exceptions to this rule do however exist, particularly at appellate level. Thus Chapter 51, section 21 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, as applicable at the relevant time, stated that:\n\u201cthe Court of Appeal may decide the case without a hearing if the prosecutor appeals only for the benefit of the accused or if an appeal lodged by the accused is supported by the opposing party.\nThe case may be decided without a hearing if the lower court has acquitted the accused or discharged the offender or found him to be exempted from punishment by virtue of mental abnormality or if it has sentenced him to a fine or ordered him to pay a money penalty (vite) and there is no reason to impose a more severe sanction than those mentioned above or to impose any other sanction ...\u201c\nAs of 1 July 1984 - and therefore after the facts of the present case - this provision has been amended to read as follows in the relevant parts (Svensk F\u00f6rfattningssamling 1984:131):\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal may dispose of an appeal on the merits without a hearing,\n##### 1. if the prosecutor appeals only for the benefit of the accused,\n##### 2. if an appeal brought by the accused is supported by the opposing party,\n##### 3. if the appeal is plainly unfounded, or\n4. if no cause exists to hold the accused legally liable, or to impose a sanction upon him, or to impose a sanction other than a fine or conditional sentence, or a combination of such sanctions.\n...\nIf, in a case referred to [above], a party has requested a hearing, this shall take place unless manifestly unnecessary.\n...\nFor a ruling not relating to the merits a hearing need not take place.\u201c\n20.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n20. Article 204 of the Swiss Criminal Code provides:\n\u201c1. Anyone who makes or has in his possession any writings, pictures, films or other items which are obscene with a view to trading in them, distributing them or displaying them in public, or who, for the above purposes, imports, transports or exports such items or puts them into circulation in any way, or who openly or secretly deals in them or publicly distributes or displays them or by way of trade supplies them for hire, or who announces or makes known in any way, with a view to facilitating such prohibited circulation or trade, that anyone is engaged in any of the aforesaid punishable activities, or who announces or makes known how or through whom such items may be directly or indirectly procured, shall be imprisoned or fined.\n2. Anyone supplying or displaying such items to a person under the age of 18 shall be imprisoned or fined.\n3. The court shall order the destruction of the items.\u201c\nThe Federal Court has consistently held that any works or items which offend, in a manner that is difficult to accept, the sense of sexual propriety, are obscene; the effect may be to arouse a normal person sexually or to disgust or repel him (Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court (ATF), vol. 83 (1957), part VI, pp. 19-25; vol. 86 (1960), part IV, pp. 19-25; vol. 87 (1961), part IV, pp. 73-85); making such items available to an indeterminate number of people amounts to \u201cpublication\u201c of them.\n21. The Federal Court held in 1963 that, for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 204, if an obscene object was of undoubted cultural interest, it was sufficient to withhold it from the general public in order to \u201cdestroy\u201c it.\nIn its judgment of 10 May 1963 in the case of Rey v. Attorney-General of Valais (ATF vol. 89 (1963), part IV, pp. 133-140), it held inter alia \u201cthat, in making destruction mandatory, the legislature had in contemplation only the commonest case, publication of entirely pornographic items\u201c. As \u201cdestruction is a measure as opposed to a punishment\u201c, \u201cit must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the desired aim\u201c, that is to say \u201cthe protection of public morality\u201c. The court went on to state:\n\u201cIn other words, \u2018destruction\u2019, as prescribed by Article 204 \u00a7 3 of the Criminal Code, must protect public morality but go no further than that requirement warrants.\nIn the commonest case, that of pornographic publications devoid of artistic, literary or scientific merit, the destruction will be physical and irreversible, not just because of the lack of any cultural value, but also because, in general, this is the only adequate way of ultimately protecting the public from the danger of the confiscated items ... .\nIt is quite a different matter when one is dealing, as in the present case, with an irreplaceable or virtually irreplaceable work of art. There is then a clash of two opposing interests, both of them important in terms of the civilisation to which Switzerland belongs: the moral and the cultural interest. In such a case, the legislature and the courts must find a way of reconciling the two. This court has thus held, in applying Article 204, that it must always be borne in mind that artistic creativity is itself subject to certain constraints of public morality, but that there must nonetheless be artistic freedom ... .\nIt is, accordingly, a matter for the courts to consider in each case in view of all the circumstances, whether physical destruction is essential or whether a more lenient measure suffices. The mandatory requirement of Article 204 \u00a7 3 will, therefore, be complied with where the courts order that an obsce", "001-57491": "\ufeff\nCOURT (PLENARY)\nCASE OF GASKIN v.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 March and 23 June 1989,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. SCOPE OF THE CASE BEFORE THE COURT\n33. The sole complaint declared admissible by the Commission was that of the applicant\u2019s continuing lack of access to the whole of his case-file held by Liverpool City Council (see paragraph 31 above). Although the question of access to the file was first posed in the context of Mr Gaskin\u2019s application for discovery of documents with a view to bringing legal proceedings against the local authority (see paragraphs 14-18 above), the only issues before the Court are those arising under Articles 8 and 10 (art. 8, art. 10) in relation to the procedures and decisions pursuant to which the applicant was refused access to the file subsequently to the termination of the proceedings for discovery (see paragraphs 93 and 104 of the Commission\u2019s report).\n### II. ALLEGED BREACH OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8)\n#### A. Applicability\n34. The applicant alleges a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which is worded as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201c\n35. Before the Commission, the Government claimed that the file as such, being information compiled for and by the local authority, did not form a part of the applicant\u2019s private life. Accordingly, in their submission, neither its compilation nor the question of access thereto fall within the scope of Article 8 (art. 8).\nIn the proceedings before the Court the Government did not revert specifically to this contention but rather concentrated on the questions whether there was any relevant interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for private life or alternatively whether there was any failure to comply with such positive obligations as are inherent in Article 8 (art. 8) to secure through its legal and administrative system respect for private life.\n36. In the opinion of the Commission \u201cthe file provided a substitute record for the memories and experience of the parents of the child who is not in care\u201c. It no doubt contained information concerning highly personal aspects of the applicant\u2019s childhood, development and history and thus could constitute his principal source of information about", "001-57496": "\ufeff\nCOURT (PLENARY)\nCASE OF GOLDER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 4451/70)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n21 February 1975\nIn the Golder case,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, taking its decision in plenary session in application of Rule 48 of the Rules of Court and composed of the following judges:\nMr. G. Balladore Pallieri, President,\nMr. H. Mosler,\nMr. A. Verdross,\nMr. E. Rodenbourg,\nMr. M. Zekia,\nMr. J. Cremona,\nMrs. I. H. Pedersen,\nMr. T. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson,\nMr. R. Ryssdal,\nMr. A. Bozer,\nMr. W. J. Ganshof van der Meersch,\nSir Gerald Fitzmaurice,\nand also Mr. M.-A. Eissen, Registrar and Mr. J.F. Smyth, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private,\nDecides as follows: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. ON THE ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\n23. Paragraphs 73, 99 and 110 of the Commission\u2019s report indicate that the Commission consider unanimously that there was a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The Government disagree with this opinion.\n24. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.\u201c\n25. In the present case the Court is called upon to decide two distinct questions arising on the text cited above:\n(i) Is Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) limited to guaranteeing in substance the right to a fair trial in legal proceedings which are already pending, or does it in addition secure a right of access to the courts for every person wishing to commence an action in order to have his civil rights and obligations determined?\n(ii) In the latter eventuality, are there any implied limitations on the right of access or on the exercise of that right which are applicable in the present case?\n#### A. On the \u201cright of access\u201c\n26. The Court recalls that on 20 March 1970 Golder petitioned the Home Secretary for permission to consult a solicitor with a view to bringing a civil action for libel against prison officer Laird and that his petition was refused on 6 April (paragraphs 16 and 18 above).\nWhile the refusal of the Home Secretary had the immediate effect of preventing Golder from contacting a solicitor, it does not at all follow from this that the only issue which can arise in the present case relates to correspondence, to the exclusion of all matters of access to the courts.\nClearly, no one knows whether Golder would have persisted in carrying out his intention to sue Laird if he had been permitted to consult a solicitor. Furthermore, the information supplied to the Court by the Government gives reason to think that a court in England would not dismiss an action brought by a convicted prisoner on the sole ground that he had managed to cause the writ to be issued - through an attorney for instance - without obtaining leave from the Home Secretary under Rules 33 para. 2 and 34 para. 8 of the Prison Rules 1964, which in any event did not happen in the present case.\nThe fact nonetheless remains that Golder had made it most clear that he intended \u201ctaking civil action for libel\u201c; it was for this purpose that he wished to contact a solicitor, which was a normal preliminary step in itself and in Golder\u2019s case probably essential on account of his imprisonment. By forbidding Golder to make such contact, the Home Secretary actually impeded the launching of the contemplated action. Without formally denying Golder his right to institute proceedings before a court, the Home Secretary did in fact prevent him from commencing an action at that time, 1970. Hindrance in fact can contravene the Convention just like a legal impediment.\nIt is true that - as the Government have emphasised - on obtaining his release Golder would have been in a position to have recourse to the courts at will, but in March and April 1970 this was still rather remote and hindering the effective exercise of a right may amount to a breach of that right, even if the hindrance is of a temporary character.\nThe Court accordingly has to examine whether the hindrance thus established violated a right guaranteed by the Convention and more particularly by Article 6 (art. 6), on which Golder relied in this respect.\n27. One point has not been put in issue and the Court takes it for granted: the \u201cright\u201c which Golder wished, rightly or wrongly, to invoke against Laird before an English court was a \u201ccivil right\u201c within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n28. Again, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does not state a right of access to the courts or tribunals in express terms. It enunciates rights which are distinct but stem from the same basic idea and which, taken together, make up a single right not specifically defined in the narrower sense of the term. It is the duty of the Court to ascertain, by means of interpretation, whether access to the courts constitutes one factor or aspect of this right.\n29. The submissions made to the Court were in the first place directed to the manner in which the Convention, and particularly Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), should be interpreted. The Court is prepared to consider, as do the Government and the Commission, that it should be guided by Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties. That Convention has not yet entered into force and it specifies, at Article 4, that it will not be retroactive, but its Articles 31 to 33 enunciate in essence generally accepted principles of international law to which the Court has already referred on occasion. In this respect, for the interpretation of the European Convention account is to be taken of those Articles subject, where appropriate, to \u201cany relevant rules of the organization\u201c - the Council of Europe - within which it has been adopted (Article 5 of the Vienna Convention).\n30. In the way in which it is presented in the \u201cgeneral rule\u201c in Article 3l of the Vienna Convention, the process of interpretation of a treaty is a unity, a single combined operation; this rule, closely integrated, places on the same footing the various elements enumerated in the four paragraphs of the Article.\n31. The terms of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the European Convention, taken in their context, provide reason to think that this right is included among the guarantees set forth.\n32. The clearest indications are to be found in the French text, first sentence. In the field of \u201ccontestations civiles\u201c (civil claims) everyone has a right to proceedings instituted by or against him being conducted in a certain way - \u201c\u00e9quitablement\u201c (fairly), \u201cpubliquement\u201c (publicly), \u201cdans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable\u201c (within a reasonable time), etc. - but also and primarily \u201c\u00e0 ce que sa cause soit entendue\u201c (that his case be heard) not by any authority whatever but \u201cpar un tribunal\u201c (by a court or tribunal) within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 39, para. 95). The Government have emphasised rightly that in French \u201ccause\u201c may mean \u201cproc\u00e8s qui se plaide\u201c (Littr\u00e9, Dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise, tome I, p. 509, 5o). This, however, is not the sole ordinary sense of this noun; it serves also to indicate by extension \u201cl\u2019ensemble des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 soutenir, \u00e0 faire pr\u00e9valoir\u201c (Paul Robert, Dictionnaire alphab\u00e9tique et analogique de la langue fran\u00e7aise, tome I, p. 666, II-2o). Similarly, the \u201ccontestation\u201c (claim) generally exists prior to the legal proceedings and is a concept independent of them. As regards the phrase \u201ctribunal ind\u00e9pendant et impartial \u00e9tabli par la loi\u201c (independent and impartial tribunal established by law), it conjures up the idea of organisation rather than that of functioning, of institutions rather than of procedure.\nThe English text, for its part, speaks of an \u201cindependent and impartial tribunal established by law\u201c. Moreover, the phrase \u201cin the determination of his civil rights and obligations\u201c, on which the Government have relied in support of their contention, does not necessarily refer only to judicial proceedings already pending; as the Commission have observed, it may be taken as synonymous with \u201cwherever his civil rights and obligations are being determined\u201c (paragraph 52 of the report). It too would then imply the right to have the determination of disputes relating to civil rights and obligations made by a court or \u201ctribunal\u201c.\nThe Government have submitted that the expressions \u201cfair and public hearing\u201c and \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201c, the second sentence in paragraph 1 (\u201cjudgment\u201c, \u201ctrial\u201c), and paragraph 3 of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3) clearly presuppose proceedings pending before a court.\nWhile the right to a fair, public and expeditious judicial procedure can assuredly apply only to proceedings in being, it does not, however, necessarily follow that a right to the very institution of such proceedings is thereby excluded; the Delegates of the Commission rightly underlined this at paragraph 21 of their memorial. Besides, in criminal matters, the \u201creasonable time\u201c may start to run from a date prior to the seisin of the trial court, of the \u201ctribunal\u201c competent for the \u201cdetermination ... of (the) criminal charge\u201c (Wemhoff judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 7, pp. 26-27, para. 19; Neumeister judgment of 27 June l968, Series A no. 8, p. 41, para. 18; Ringeisen judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 45, para. 110). It is conceivable also that in civil matters the reasonable time may begin to run, in certain circumstances, even before the issue of the writ commencing proceedings before the court to which the plaintiff submits the dispute.\n33. The Government have furthermore argued the necessity of relating Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) to Articles 5 para. 4 and 13 (art. 5-4, art. 13). They have observed that the latter provide expressly or a right of access to the courts; the omission of any corresponding clause in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) seems to them to be only the more striking. The Government have also submitted that if Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) were interpreted as providing such a right of access, Articles 5 para. 4 and 13 (art. 5-4, art. 13) would become superfluous.\nThe Commission\u2019s Delegates replied in substance that Articles 5 para. 4 and 13 (art. 5-4, art. 13), as opposed to Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), are \u201caccessory\u201c to other provisions. Those Articles, they say, do not state a specific right but are designed to afford procedural guarantees, \u201cbased on recourse\u201c, the former for the \u201cright to liberty\u201c, as stated in Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), the second for the whole of the \u201crights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention\u201c. Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), they continue, is intended to protect \u201cin itself\u201c the \u201cright to a good administration of justice\u201c, of which \u201cthe right that justice should be administered\u201c constitutes \u201can essential and inherent element\u201c. This would serve to explain the contrast between the wording of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) and that of Articles 5 para. 4 and 13 (art. 5-4, art. 13).\nThis reasoning is not without force even though the expression \u201cright to a fair (or good) administration of justice\u201c, which sometimes is used on account of its conciseness and convenience (for example, in the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, p. 15, para. 25), does not appear in the text of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), and can also be understood as referring only to the working and not to the organisation of justice.\nThe Court finds in particular that the interpretation which the Government have contested does not lead to confounding Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) with Articles 5 para. 4 and 13 (art. 5-4, art. 13), nor making these latter provisions superfluous. Article 13 (art. 13) speaks of an effective remedy before a \u201cnational authority\u201c (\u201cinstance nationale\u201c) which may not be a \u201ctribunal\u201c or \u201ccourt\u201c within the meaning of Articles 6 para. 1 and 5 para. 4 (art. 6-1, art. 5-4). Furthermore, the effective remedy deals with the violation of a right guaranteed by the Convention, while Articles 6 para. 1 and 5 para. 4 (art. 6-1, art. 5-4) cover claims relating in the first case to the existence or scope of civil rights and in the second to the lawfulness of arrest or detention. What is more, the three provisions do not operate in the same field. The concept of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201c (Article 6 para. 1) (art. 6-1) is not co-extensive with that of \u201crights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention\u201c (Article 13) (art. 13), even if there may be some overlapping. As to the \u201cright to liberty\u201c (Article 5) (art. 5), its \u201ccivil\u201c character is at any rate open to argument (Neumeister judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 43, para. 23; Matznetter judgment of 10 November 1969, Series A no. 10, p. 35, para. 13; De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 44, para. 86).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Constitutional provisions relating to the family\n16. The Constitution of Ireland, which came into force in 1937, includes the following provisions:\n\u201c40.3.1o The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.\n40.3.2o The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.\n41.1.1o The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.\n41.1.2o The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.\n(...)\n41.3.1o The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.\n41.3.2o No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.\n(...)\n42.1. The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.\n(...)\n42.5. In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.\u201c\n17. As a result of Article 41.3.2o of the Constitution, divorce in the sense of dissolution of a marriage (divorce a vinculo matrimonii) is not available in Ireland. However, spouses may be relieved of the duty of cohabiting either by a legally binding deed of separation concluded between them or by a court decree of judicial separation (also known as a divorce a mensa et thoro); such a decree, which is obtainable only on proof of commission of adultery, cruelty or unnatural offences, does not dissolve the marriage. In the remainder of the present judgment, the word \u201cdivorce\u201c denotes a divorce a vinculo matrimonii.\nIt is also possible to obtain on various grounds a decree of nullity, that is a declaration by the High Court that a marriage was invalid and therefore null and void ab initio. A marriage may also be \u201cannulled\u201c by an ecclesiastical tribunal, but this does not affect the civil status of the parties.\n18. The Irish courts have consistently held that the \u201cFamily\u201c that is afforded protection by Article 41 of the Constitution is the family based on marriage. Thus, in The State (Nicolaou) v. An Bord Ucht\u00e1la The Adoption Board 1966 Irish Reports 567, the Supreme Court said:\n\u201cIt is quite clear from the provisions of Article 41, and in particular section 3 thereof, that the family referred to in this Article is the family which is founded on the institution of marriage and, in the context of the Article, marriage means valid marriage under the law for the time being in force in the State. While it is quite true that unmarried persons cohabiting together and the children of their union may often be referred to as a family and have many, if not all, of the outward appearances of a family, and may indeed for the purposes of a particular law be regarded as such, nevertheless as far as Article 41 is concerned the guarantees therein contained are confined to families based upon marriage.\u201c\nThe Supreme Court has, however, held that an illegitimate child has unenumerated natural rights (as distinct from rights conferred by law) which will be protected under Article 40.3 of the Constitution, such as the right to be fed and to live, to be reared and educated, to have the opportunity of working and of realising his or her full personality and dignity as a human being, as well as the same natural rights under the Constitution as a legitimate child to \u201creligious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education\u201c (G v. An Bord Ucht\u00e1la 1980 Irish Reports 32).\n#### B. Recognition of foreign divorces\n19. Article 41.3.3o of the Constitution provides:\n\u201cNo person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage dissolved.\u201c\n20. A series of judicial decisions has established that the foregoing provision does not prevent the recognition by Irish courts, under the general Irish rules of private international law, of certain decrees of divorce obtained, even by Irish nationals, in another State. Such recognition used to be granted only if the parties to the marriage were domiciled within the jurisdiction of the foreign court at the time of the relevant proceedings (Re Caffin Deceased: Bank of Ireland v. Caffin 1971 Irish Reports 123; Gaffney v. Gaffney 1975 Irish Reports 133; however, since 2 October 1986 a divorce will be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled (Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986). To be regarded as domiciled in a foreign State, a person must not only be resident there but also have the intention of remaining there permanently and have lost the animus revertendi. Moreover, the foreign divorce will not be recognised if domicile has been fraudulently invoked before the foreign court for the purpose of obtaining the decree.\n21. If notice is served for a civil marriage before a Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths in Ireland and he is aware that either of the parties has been divorced abroad, he must, under the regulations in force, refer the matter to the Registrar-General. The latter will seek legal advice as to whether on the facts of the case the divorce would be recognised as effective to dissolve the marriage under Irish law and as to whether the intended marriage can consequently be permitted.\n#### C.

PINHEIRO FARINHA,\nand also Mr. H. PETZOLD, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11, 13 and 14 March, and then on 30 June, 1, 3 and 4 July 1978,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last- mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. ON ARTICLE 25 PARA. 1 (art. 25-1)\n30. Both in their written memorial and in their oral submissions, the Government formally invited the Court to find that the application lodged with the Commission was \u201cinadmissible\u201c. They argued that the applicants could not be considered as \u201cvictims\u201c within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1) which provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Commission may receive petitions addressed to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in this Convention, provided that the High Contracting Party against which the complaint has been lodged has declared that it recognises the competence of the Commission to receive such petitions ...\u201c\nIn the Government\u2019s submission, the applicants were not claiming to have established an individual violation, even potential, of their own rights but rather, on the basis of the purely hypothetical possibility of being subject to surveillance, were seeking a general and abstract review of the contested legislation in the light of the Convention.\n31. According to the reply given by the Delegates at the hearing, the Commission agreed with the Government that the Court is competent to determine whether the applicants can claim to be \u201cvictims\u201c within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1). However, the Commission disagreed with the Government in so far as the latter\u2019s proposal might imply the suggestion that the Commission\u2019s decision on the admissibility of the application should as such be reviewed by the Court.\nThe Delegates considered that the Government were requiring too rigid a standard for the notion of a \u201cvictim\u201c of an alleged breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. They submitted that, in order to be able to claim to be the victim of an interference with the exercise of the right conferred on him by Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), it should suffice that a person is in a situation where there is a reasonable risk of his being subjected to secret surveillance. In the Delegates\u2019 view, the applicants are not only to be considered as constructive victims, as the Commission had in effect stated: they can claim to be direct victims of a violation of their rights under Article 8 (art. 8) in that under the terms of the contested legislation everyone in the Federal Republic of Germany who could be presumed to have contact with people involved in subversive activity really runs the risk of being subject to secret surveillance, the sole existence of this risk being in itself a restriction on free communication.\nThe Principal Delegate, for another reason, regarded the application as rightly declared admissible. In his view, the alleged violation related to a single right which, although not expressly enounced in the Convention, was to be derived by necessary implication; this implied right was the right of every individual to be informed within a reasonable time of any secret measure taken in his respect by the public authorities and amounting to an interference with his rights and freedoms under the Convention.\n32. The Court confirms the well-established principle of its own case-law that, once a case is duly referred to it, the Court is endowed with full jurisdiction and may take cognisance of all questions of fact or of law arising in the course of the proceedings, including questions which may have been raised before the Commission under the head of admissibility. This conclusion is in no way invalidated by the powers conferred on the Commission under Article 27 (art. 27) of the Convention as regards the admissibility of applications. The task which this Article assigns to the Commission is one of sifting; the Commission either does or does not accept the applications. Its decision to reject applications which it considers to be inadmissible are without appeal as are, moreover, also those by which applications are accepted; they are taken in complete independence (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, pp. 29 and 30, paras. 47-54; see also the judgment of 9 February 1967 on the preliminary objection in the \u201cBelgian Linguistic\u201c case, Series A no. 5, p. 18; the Handyside judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, p. 20, para. 41; and the judgment of 18 January 1978 in the case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom, Series A no. 25, p. 63, para. 157).\nThe present case concerns, inter alia, the interpretation of the notion of \u201cvictim\u201c within the meaning of Article 25 (art. 25) of the Convention, this being a matter already raised before the Commission. The Court therefore affirms its jurisdiction to examine the issue arising under that Article (art. 25).\n33. While Article 24 (art. 24) allows each Contracting State to refer to the Commission \u201cany alleged breach\u201c of the Convention by another Contracting State, a person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals must, in order to", "001-57519": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF LEANDER v.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 and 31 May and 28 August 1986 and on 25 February 1987,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prohibition of registration of opinion\n18. According to Chapter 2, section 3, of the Swedish Instrument of Government (regeringsformen, which forms the main constituent of the Swedish Constitution and is hereafter referred to as \u201cthe Constitution\u201c), \u201cno entry regarding a citizen in a public register may without his consent be founded exclusively on his political opinion\u201c.\n#### B. Secret police-register\n19. The legal basis of the register kept by the National Police Board\u2019s Security Department (\u201cthe secret police-register\u201c) is to be found in the Personnel Control Ordinance, which was enacted by the Government under their regulatory powers and which was originally published in the Swedish Official Journal (svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling, 1969:446). Section 2 of the Ordinance (as amended by Ordinance 1972:505) provides:\n\u201cFor the special police service responsible for the prevention and detection of offences against national security, etc., the Security Department within the National Police Board shall keep a police-register. In this register, the National Police Board may enter information necessary for the special police service.\nIn the police-register referred to in the first paragraph, no entry is allowed merely for the reason that a person, by belonging to an organisation or by other means, has expressed a political opinion. Further provisions concerning the application of this rule shall be laid down by the Government.\u201c\n20. In consequence, the following instructions, published on 22 September 1972, were given to the National Police Board by the Government:\n\u201cIn this country, there exist organisations and groups engaging in political activities which involve the use or the possible use of force or threats of compulsion as means to achieve their political aims.\nSome organisations have adopted a programme in which it is said that the organisation shall endeavour to change the social system by violence. It can be assumed, however, that a large part of the membership of such organisations will never take part in the realisation of the goals in the programme. The mere fact of being a member of such an organisation does not therefore constitute a reason for the Security Police to make an entry about a person in its register. An entry may be made, however, if a member or a supporter of such an organisation has acted in a way which justifies the suspicion that he may be prepared to participate in activities which endanger national security or which are aimed at, and may contribute towards, overthrowing the democratic system by force or affecting the status of Sweden as an independent State.\nThere also exist organisations and groups which may engage in, or may have engaged in, political subversion in Sweden or in other States, while using force, threats or compulsion as means for such subversion. Information about members or supporters of such organisations or groups shall be entered in the register of the Security Police.\nFurther instructions concerning the application of section 2 of the Personnel Control Ordinance shall be issued by the Government following proposals from the National Police Board. If, in the special police service, circumstances appear which may call for amendments to the instructions issued by the Government the National Police Board should submit proposals for such amendments.\u201c\n21. Further instructions, this time secret, were issued by the Government on 27 April 1973 and again on 3 December 1981.\n22. In addition to the circumstances provided for in the Personnel Control Ordinance (see paragraph 24 below), information from the secret police-register appears also to be released by the National Police Board in certain cases of public prosecution and in matters relating to applications for Swedish citizenship.\n#### C. Personnel control\n23. In addition to the above-mentioned provisions regarding the secret police-register, the Personnel Control Ordinance contains provisions as to, inter alia, the posts which are to be security classified, the procedure for handing out information and the use of the information released. The main relevant provisions are summarised below.\n24. According to section 1, personnel control means the obtaining of information from police registers in respect of persons holding or being considered for appointment to posts of importance for national security.\n25. Section 3 (as amended by Ordinance 1976:110) enumerates certain authorities, including the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, entitled to request a personnel control.\n26. Section 4 specifies that a personnel control may only be carried out with regard to certain posts of importance for national security. The posts concerned are divided into two security classes (skyddsklasser), depending upon whether or not they are of vital importance for national security. The decision to classify a post in Security Class 1 is taken by the Government, whereas the right to classify a post in Security Class 2 is normally delegated to the authority in question.\n27. According to section 6, requests for release of information for the purposes of a personnel control are to be made to the National Police Board and the request shall be made only with regard to the person whom it is intended to appoint to the post.\n28. Sections 8 and 9 deal with what information may be handed out to the appointing authority.\nIf the post in question falls within Security Class 1, the National Police Board may, under section 8, release all information on the person concerned contained in the secret police-register or in any other police register. If the post comes within Security Class 2, the Board may, by virtue of section 9 (as amended by Ordinance 1972:505), only supply a certain specific kind of information on the person concerned, namely\n\u201c1. his conviction for, or his being suspected of having committed, crimes mentioned in paragraph 1 of the Act of 21 March 1952 (no. 98) laying down special provisions on investigation measures in certain criminal cases (lag med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om tv\u00e5ngsmedel i v", "001-57530": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF LUEDICKE, BELKACEM AND KO\u00c7 v.

ON THE SUGGESTION TO SEVER MR. KO\u00c7\u2019S CASE AND TO STRIKE IT OUT OF THE LIST\n33. In their application bringing the case before the Court, the Government stated: \u201cAs far as the applicant Ko\u00e7 is concerned there arises the further question whether he is a \u2018victim\u2019 within the meaning of Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1), first sentence, of the Convention since in his case the competent authority abstained from recovering the court fees (including interpreter\u2019s fees) because there was no prospect of success.\u201c They further stated that they reserved the right to apply in due course for the case of Mr. Ko\u00e7 \u201cto be dealt with in separate proceedings and in accordance with the provisions of Rule 47 para. 2 of the Rules of Court\u201c.\nThus, in their memorial, the Government suggested that the Court sever the proceedings concerning Mr. Ko\u00e7 from the proceedings regarding the other applicants and strike the case out of the list as far as Mr. Ko\u00e7 was concerned. With the agreement of the Minister of Justice for the Land of North-Rhine Westphalia, they declared that Mr. Ko\u00e7 would not be asked to pay the costs even if he returned to the Federal Republic of Germany, because \u201cthe costs of such compulsory collection and the administrative costs would be out of proportion to the sum owed\u201c. In their submission, in view of this change in the legal situation to his advantage, there was no longer any interest for the applicant in the action being pursued, especially since the point of law raised by his application was also the subject-matter of the proceedings regarding Mr. Luedicke and Mr. Belkacem.\nReferring to the possible application of Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, the Agent stressed at the hearing that, should the Court rule against them, the Government would fully comply with their obligations under the Convention without a further decision under Article 50 (art. 50) being necessary. She specified that this statement applied also to the necessary ancillary costs incurred by Mr. Ko\u00e7.\n34. The Delegates advised the Court on 8 May 1978 that, acting on instructions unanimously decided upon by the Commission, they were opposed to the Government\u2019s suggestion. At the same time, they communicated to the Court a note indicating, amongst other things, that Mr. Ko\u00e7 took issue with the said suggestion. According to Mr. Ko\u00e7, his interest to have pursued the examination of his complaints remained unchanged since \u201cthe effect of the decision of 5 June 1975 of the Cologne Court of Appeal is being upheld\u201c.\nAt the hearing on 25 May, in reply to a question from the President of the Chamber, the Principal Delegate at first stated that the Commission accepted Mr. Ko\u00e7\u2019s opinion.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Act on \u201cregulatory offences\u201c\n19. The subject of \u201cregulatory offences\u201c is governed by the Act of 24 May 1968 on \u201cregulatory offences\u201c (Gesetz \u00fcber Ordnungswidrigkeiten), in its version of 1 January 1975 (\u201cthe 1968/1975 Act\u201c). The purpose of this legislation was to remove petty offences from the sphere of the criminal law. Included in this category were contraventions of the Road Traffic Act. Under section 21 of the Road Traffic Act (in its old version), commission of such contraventions had given rise to liability to a fine (Geldstrafe) or imprisonment (Haft). Section 3(6) of the Act of 24 May 1968 (Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum Gesetz \u00fcber Ordnungswidrigkeiten) classified them as \u201cOrdnungswidrigkeiten\u201c and henceforth made them punishable only by fines (Geldbussen) not deemed to be criminal by the legislature.\nThe 1968/1975 Act had been preceded in the Federal Republic by the Act of 25 March 1952 on \u201cregulatory offences\u201c and, to a certain extent, the Economic Crime Act of 26 July 1949 (Wirtschaftsstrafgesetz). It was most recently amended by a statute of 7 July 1986, which entered into force on 1 April 1987.\n##### 1. General provisions\n20. Section 1(1) of the 1968/1975 Act defines a \u201cregulatory offence\u201c as an unlawful (rechtswidrig) and reprehensible (vorwerfbar) act, contravening a legal provision which makes offenders liable to a fine. The fine cannot be less than DM 5 or, as a general rule, more than DM 1,000 (section 17(1)). The amount of the fine is fixed in each case by reference to the seriousness of the offence, the degree of misconduct attributable to the offender and, save for minor (geringf\u00fcgig) offences, the offender\u2019s financial circumstances (section 17(3)).\nIf the act constitutes both a \u201cregulatory\u201c and a criminal offence, only the criminal law is applicable; however, if no criminal penalty (Strafe) is imposed, the act may be punished as a \u201cregulatory offence\u201c (section 21).\n##### 2. The prosecuting authorities\n21. \u201cRegulatory offences\u201c are to be dealt with by the administrative authorities (Verwaltungsbeh\u00f6rde) designated by law, save in so far as the 1968/1975 Act confers the power of prosecution of such offences on the public prosecutor and the trial and punishment of them on the courts (sections 35 and 36). Where an act has come before him as a criminal matter, the public prosecutor may also treat the act as a \u201cregulatory offence\u201c (section 40).\n22. The administrative authorities will remit the matter to the public prosecutor if there is reason to suppose that a criminal offence has been committed; he will refer the matter back to them if he does not take proceedings (section 41). In the case of a \u201cregulatory offence\u201c having a close connection with a criminal offence in respect of which the public prosecutor has instituted proceedings, the prosecutor may extend the criminal proceedings to cover the \u201cregulatory offence\u201c as long as the administrative authorities have not fixed any fine (section 42).\nThe public prosecutor\u2019s decision to treat or not to treat an act as a criminal offence is binding on the administrative authorities (section 44).\n##### 3. Procedure in general\n23. Subject to the exceptions laid down in the 1968/1975 Act, the provisions of the ordinary law governing criminal procedure - in particular the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Judicature Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) and the Juvenile Courts Act (Jugendgerichtsgesetz) - are applicable by analogy (sinngem\u00e4ss) to the procedure in respect of \u201cregulatory offences\u201c (section 46(1)). The prosecuting authorities (see paragraph 21 above) have the same rights and duties as the public prosecutor in a criminal matter unless the 1968/1975 Act itself states otherwise (section 46(2)). Nevertheless, a number of measures permissible in criminal matters cannot be ordered in respect of \u201cregulatory offences\u201c, notably arrest, interim police custody (vorl\u00e4ufige Festnahme) and seizure of mail or telegrams (section 46(3)", "001-57533": "\ufeff\nCOURT (PLENARY)\nCASE OF MALONE v.

RELEVANT LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Introduction\n19. The following account is confined to the law and practice in England and Wales relating to the interception of communications on behalf of the police for the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime. The expression \u201cinterception\u201c is used to mean the obtaining of information about the contents of a communication by post or telephone without the consent of the parties involved.\n20. It has for long been the practice for the interception of postal and telephone communications in England and Wales to be carried out on the authority of a warrant issued by a Secretary of State, nowadays normally the Secretary of State for the Home Department (the Home Secretary). There is no overall statutory code governing the matter, although various statutory provisions are applicable thereto. The effect in domestic law of these provisions is the subject of some dispute in the current proceedings. Accordingly, the present summary of the facts is limited to what is undisputed, the submissions in relation to the contested aspects of these provisions being dealt with in the part of the judgment \u201cas to the law\u201c.\n21. Three official reports available to the public have described and examined the working of the system for the interception of communications.\nFirstly, a Committee of Privy Councillors under the chairmanship of Lord Birkett was appointed in June 1957 \u201cto consider and report upon the exercise by the Secretary of State of the executive power to intercept communications and, in particular, under what authority, to what extent and for what purposes this power has been exercised and to what use information so obtained has been put; and to recommend whether, how and subject to what safeguards, this power should be exercised ...\u201c. The Committee\u2019s report (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Birkett report\u201c) was published in October 1957 (as Command Paper 283). The Government of the day announced that they accepted the report and its recommendations, and were taking immediate steps to implement those recommendations calling for a change in procedure. Subsequent Governments, in the person of the Prime Minister or the Home Secretary, publicly reaffirmed before Parliament that the arrangements relating to the interception of communications were strictly in accordance with the procedures described and recommended in the Birkett report.\nSecondly, a Command Paper entitled \u201cThe Interception of Communications in Great Britain\u201c was presented to Parliament by the then Home Secretary in April 1980 (Command Paper 7873 - hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe White Paper\u201c). The purpose of the White Paper was to bring up to date the account given in the Birkett report.\nFinally, in March 1981 a report by Lord Diplock, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary who had been appointed to monitor the relevant procedures on a continuing basis (see paragraphs 54 and 55 below), was published outlining the results of the monitoring he had carried out to date.\n22. The legal basis of the practice of intercepting telephone communications was also examined by the Vice-Chancellor in his judgment in the action which the applicant brought against the Metropolitan Police Commissioner (see paragraphs 31-36 below).\n23. Certain changes have occurred in the organisation of the postal and telephone services since 1957, when the Birkett Committee made its report. The Post Office, which ran both services, was then a Department of State under the direct control of a Minister (the Postmaster General). By virtue of the Post Office Act 1969, it became a public corporation with a certain independence of the Crown, though subject to various ministerial powers of supervision and control exercised at the material time by the Home Secretary. The Post Office Act 1969 was repealed in part and amended by the British Telecommunications Act 1981. That Act divided the Post Office into two corporations: the Post Office, responsible for mail, and British Telecommunications, responsible for telephones. The 1981 Act made no change of substance in relation to the law governing interceptions. For the sake of convenience, references in the present judgment are to the position as it was before the 1981 Act came into force.\n#### B. Legal position relating to interception of communications prior to 1969\n24. The existence of a power vested in the Secretary of State to authorise by warrant the interception of correspondence, in the sense of detaining and opening correspondence transmitted by post, has been acknowledged from early times and its exercise has been publicly known (see the Birkett report, Part I, especially paras. 11, 17 and 39). The precise origin in law of this executive authority is obscure (ibid., para. 9). Nevertheless, although none of the Post Office statutes (of 1710, 1837, 1908 or 1953) contained clauses expressly conferring authority to intercept communications, all recognised the power as an independently existing power which it was lawful to exercise (ibid., paras. 17 and 38).\n25. At the time of the Birkett report, the most recent statutory provision recognising the right of interception of a postal communication was section 58 sub-section 1 of the Post Office Act 1953, which provides:\n\u201cIf any officer of the Post Office, contrary to his duty, opens ... any postal packet in course of transmission by post, or wilfully detains or delays ... any such postal packet, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour ... .\nProvided that nothing in this section shall extend to ... the opening, detaining or delaying of a postal packet ... in obedience to an express warrant in writing under the hand of a Secretary of State.\u201c\n\u201cPostal packet\u201c is defined in section 87 sub-section 1 of the Act as meaning:\n\u201ca letter, postcard, reply postcard, newspaper, printed packet, sample packet or parcel and every packet or article transmissible by post, and includes a telegram\u201c.\nSection 58, which is still in force, reproduced a clause that had been on the statute book without material amendment since 1710.\n26. So far as telecommunications are further concerned, it is an offence under section 45 of the Telegraph Act 1863 if an official of the Post Office \u201cimproperly divulges to any person the purport of any message\u201c. Section 11 of the Post Office (Protection) Act 1884 creates a similar offence in relation to telegrams. In addition, section 20 of the Telegraph Act 1868 makes it a criminal offence if any Post Office official \u201cshall, contrary to his duty, disclose or in any way make known or intercept the contents or any part of the contents of any telegraphic message or any message entrusted to the [Post Office] for the purpose of transmission\u201c.\nThese provisions are still in force.\n27. It was held in a case decided in 1880 (Attorney General v. Edison Telephone Company, (1880) 6 Queen\u2019s Bench Division 244) that a telephone conversation is a \u201ctelegraphic communication\u201c for the purposes of the Telegraph Acts. It has not been disputed in the present proceedings that the offences under the Telegraph Acts apply to telephone conversations.\n28. The power to intercept telephone messages has been exercised in England and Wales from time to time since the introduction of the telephone. Until the year 1937, the Post Office, which was at that time a Department of Government, acted upon the view that the power which the Crown exercised in intercepting telephone messages was a power possessed by any operator of telephones and was not contrary to law. Consequently, no warrants by the Secretary of State were issued and arrangements for the interception of telephone conversations were made directly between the police authorities and the Director-General of the Post Office. In 1937, the position was reviewed by the Home Secretary and the Postmaster General (the Minister then responsible for the administration of the Post Office) and it was decided, as a matter of policy, that it was undesirable that records of telephone conversations should be made by Post Office servants and disclosed to the police without the authority of the Secretary of State. The view was taken that the power which had for long been exercised to intercept postal communications on the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of State was, by its nature, wide enough to include the interception of telephone communications. Since 1937 it had accordingly been the practice of the Post Office to intercept telephone conversations only on the express warrant of the Secretary of State (see the Birkett report, paras. 40-41).\nThe Birkett Committee considered that the power to intercept telephone communications rested upon the power plainly recognised by the Post Office statutes as existing before the enactment of the statutes (Birkett report, para. 50). It concluded (ibid., para. 51):\n\u201cWe are therefore of the opinion that the state of the law might fairly be expressed in this way.\n(a) The power to intercept letters has been exercised from the earliest times, and has been recognised in successive Acts of Parliament.\n(b) This power extends to telegrams.\n(c) It is difficult to resist the view that if there is a lawful power to intercept communications in the form of letters and telegrams, then it is wide enough to cover telephone communications as well.\u201c\n#### C. Post Office Act 1969\n29. Under the Post Office Act 1969, the \u201cPost Office\u201c ceased to be a Department of State and was established as a public corporation of that name with the powers, duties and functions set out in the Act. In consequence of the change of status of the Post Office and of the fact that the Post Office was no longer under the direct control of a Minister of the Crown, it became necessary t", "001-57546": "\ufeff\nCOURT (PLENARY)\nCASE OF N\u00d6LKENBOCKHOFF v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n23. Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which was applied by the Essen Regional Court in its judgment of 11 July 1980, provides:\n\u201c1. The public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute\n(1) where the penalty or the corrective or preventive measure to be expected if a conviction is secured is almost negligible in comparison with a penalty or corrective or preventive measure imposed on the defendant in a final decision - or which he must expect to be imposed - for another offence ...\n....\n2. Once proceedings have been instituted, the court may provisionally stay them at any stage on an application by the public prosecutor.\n....\u201c\n24. By the terms of Article 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any judgment, order of summary punishment or decision terminating a set of proceedings must determine who is to pay the costs of the proceedings (paragraph 1); the judgment or decision in which the proceedings culminate shall state who is to bear the necessary costs and expenses (paragraph 2).\nArticle 467 of the Code of Criminal Procedure further provides:\n\u201c1. If the defendant (Angeschuldigter) is acquitted or if committal for trial (Hauptverfahren) is refused or if the proceedings against him are discontinued, the costs of the proceedings and the defendant\u2019s necessary costs and expenses shall be borne by the Treasury.\n...\n3. ... The court may decline to award the defendant\u2019s necessary costs and expenses against the Treasury where the defendant\n...\n(2) has avoided conviction merely because of a technical bar to the proceedings (Verfahrenshindernis).\n4. If the court stays the proceedings under a provision which leaves this decision to its discretion, it may decide not to order the Treasury to bear the defendant\u2019s necessary costs and expenses.\n....\u201c\nInasmuch as the law does not make the reimbursement of necessary costs and expenses mandatory, the courts decide the issue on an equitable basis and have a degree of discretion in the matter.\n25. The death of a person who has been convicted, if it occurs before the relevant criminal proceedings have been definitively closed, terminates those proceedings without any decision by the competent court being needed; in such circumstances, the costs of the proceedings cannot be awarded against the estate of the deceased (Article 465 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\nAs regards the deceased\u2019s own necessary costs and expenses and inde", "001-57554": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF PAKELLI v.

The applicant complained of the refusal of the Federal Court, in proceedings concerning an appeal on points of law (Revision), to appoint Mr. Rauschenbusch as official defence counsel for the hearings of 29 November 1977 before that court; he alleged that this constituted a violation of paragraph 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c), and also of paragraph 1, of Article 6 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\nIt was not disputed that these provisions were applicable in the present case and the Court takes this point as established (see, mutatis mutandis, the Delcourt judgment of 17 January 1970, Series A no. 11, pp. 13-15, paras. 25 and 26, and the Artico judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 15-18, paras. 31-38). However, as the Government rightly pointed out, the manner in which those paragraphs are to be applied depends on the special features of the proceedings involved (see the above-mentioned Delcourt judgment, ibid.).\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. General description of the licence system\n16. The relevant law is to be found in the Act and the Ordinance of 1979 on Commercial Transport (yrkestrafiklagen 1979:559 - \u201cthe 1979 Act\u201c, and yrkestrafikf\u00f6rordningen 1979:871 - \u201cthe 1979 Ordinance\u201c).\nSection 4 in Chapter 1 of the 1979 Act defines commercial transport as a transport service of goods or passengers by car, truck or bus offered to the public for a fee. Such service may only be performed by persons possessing a transport licence (Chapter 2, section 1).\n#### B. Conditions for the issue of licences\n17. Under the 1979 Act (Chapter 1, section 5), there are three kinds of passenger transport licences, which can briefly be described as follows:\n- transport on request, where the vehicle, with a driver, is put at the customer\u2019s disposal and the price is determined according to the customer\u2019s use of it (best\u00e4llningstrafik);\n- tourist transport, which comprises commissioned tours for sightseeing, etc. (turisttrafik); and\n- regular transport on defined routes within or between specified urban areas - interurban traffic (linjetrafik) -, where the vehicle is not put at the customer\u2019s disposal.\nOnly persons (physical or legal) deemed suitable to conduct the service may obtain a licence. In examining applications, such factors as professional skill and personal and economic circumstances are considered, with a view to ensuring that the transport is effected under safe conditions by economically stable undertakings (Chapter 2, section 3, of the 1979 Act). A further condition is that the intended service is deemed necessary and appropriate (Chapter 2, section 11). The reason for this is the overall objective of establishing an adequate transport network and preventing any harmful surplus service. This objective extends to ensuring that transport operators who work on days and at hours that are not profitable are not exposed to uncontrolled competition from others who only provide a service when profitable.\nThe licensing authority makes licences to carry passengers on interurban routes subject to specific conditions, concerning such matters as routes and time-tables (Chapter 2, section 23, and Chapter ", "001-57563": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF RASMUSSEN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Background to the 1960 Act on the Legal Status of Children\n16. Prior to the enactment of the 1960 Act, which applied in Mr. Rasmussen's case, the status of children was regulated in the Illegitimacy Act of 1937 and the Legitimacy Act of the same year. Section 3 of the latter provided that proceedings to contest paternity of a legitimate child could be instituted by the mother, the husband, the child or a person appointed guardian of the child. No time-limit was laid down for the institution of such proceedings.\n17. According to Danish case-law and legal writing, however, a husband could be estopped from contesting paternity of a child born in wedlock if, knowing that his wife had had sexual intercourse with another man during the relevant period, he had expressly or tacitly acknowledged after the child's birth that he was the father. The \u201cdoctrine of acknowledgement\u201c (anerkendelseslaeren) was first established in 1956 by a judgment of the Supreme Court, reported in Ugeskrift for Retsvaesen (U.f.R.) 1956, p. 107. Although there was no case-law on the point, legal writers expressed the view that this doctrine applied also to mothers (see, for instance, Ernst Andersen, Aegteskabsret I, 1954, p. 95).\n18. In December 1949, the Ministry of Justice set up a committee, called the \u201cPaternity Committee\u201c, to consider, inter alia, certain aspects of the status of children born in wedlock. In June 1955, the Committee submitted its report (no. 126/1955) on the amendment of the rules regarding determination of paternity.\nAs to the husband's right to institute proceedings to challenge paternity of a child born in wedlock, the Committee recommended the institution of a double time-limit of six months from the time when the husband became aware of the facts affording grounds for contes", "001-57571": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF SANCHEZ-REISSE v.

The procedure followed\n43. Mr. Sanchez-Reisse alleged that the Swiss system for appealing against detention with a view to extradition did not, at the time, afford adequate safeguards when measured against Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\n##### 1. No direct access to a court\n44. In the first place, he complained of the fact that he had not been able to apply directly to a court. Being obliged, like anyone who was detained with a view to extradition, to turn first of all to an administrative body, he did not have, so he maintained, direct access to the judicial authority competent to hear a request by him for provisional release.\nThe Commission found it surprising that the courts could entertain such a request only if it was accompanied by comments from the executive, which by definition would have refused release.\nIn the Government\u2019s submission, on the other hand, there was nothing to prevent the Contracting States from regulating access to the courts as long as the measures taken were in the interests of the proper administration of justice.\n45.

During the hearing of 17 January 1978, reference was made to the fact that the declaration by the Government recognising the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory in respect of the Isle of Man expired on 13 January 1976, whereas the case was brought before the Court by the Commission on 11 March 1977.\nIn its request to the Court, the Commission indicated that it had had regard to the various renewals of the said declaration and particularly the renewal dated 21 April 1972 which was in force at the time of the introduction of the application before the Commission. For their part, the Government, which had not filed any preliminary objection pursuant to Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, stated at the hearing that they consented to the Court having jurisdiction in accordance with Article 48 (art. 48), although it was not to be inferred that they necessarily agreed with the reasoning in the Commission\u2019s request.\nThe Court finds that in these circumstances its jurisdiction is established.\n#### B. The request to strike the case out of the Court\u2019s list\n24. The Attorney-General for the Isle of Man first submitted that the Court should strike the case out of its list in view of the fact that Mr. Tyrer, who had lodged his application with the Commission when he was under age, had declared, after he had attained full age, that he wished to withdraw it.\nOn 9 March 1976, the Commission had decided, pursuant to the then Rule 43 of its Rules of Procedure, that it could not accede to the applicant\u2019s request since the case raised questions of a general character affecting the observance of the Convention which necessitated a further examination of the issues involved (see paragraph 21 above). Before the Court, the principal delegate submitted that the applicant\u2019s wishes must be subordinated to the general interest to ensure respect for human rights as defined in the Convention. He added that the Commission had never examined the reasons for, and circumstances surrounding, the applicant\u2019s request.\nThe Attorney-General for the Isle of Man conceded that, under its Rules of Procedure, the Commission was entitled to refuse, on the grounds mentioned above, to allow Mr. Tyrer to withdraw. He did not suggest that there had been any irregularity in the Commission\u2019s decision; he merely contended that in the particular circumstances the applicant\u2019s wishes should supersede the general character of the case and that therefore the Court should consider striking the case out of its list under Rule 47 of its Rules.\n25. The regularity of the Commission\u2019s decision to continue its examination of the application is not in issue and the Court has only to decide whether or not the case should be struck out.\nParagraph 1 of Rule 47 is not applicable in the circumstances. Firstly, when Mr. Tyrer declared that he wished to withdraw his application the case was still pending before the Commission. Secondly that declaration, coming from an individual who is not entitled under the Convention to refer cases to the Court, cannot entail the effects of a discontinuance of the present proceedings (De Becker judgment of 27 March 1962, Series A no. 4, p. 23, para. 4). Above all, paragraph 1 covers solely discontinuance by \u201ca Party which has brought the case before the Court\u201c, that is to say by an Applicant Contracting State in proceedings before the Court (paragraph (h) of Rule 1; Kjeldsen, Busk Madsen and Pedersen judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 23, p. 21, para. 47).\nParagraph 2 of Rule 47 provides that the Court may, subject to paragraph 3, strike out of its list a case brought before it by the Commission but only when the Court \u201cis informed of a friendly settlement, arrangement or other fact of a kind to provide a solution of the matter\u201c. As mentioned above, the Commission never examined the circumstances surrounding the applicant\u2019s request and the Court has been supplied with no further information regarding those circumstances. Thus, the Court has received no indication that Mr. Tyrer\u2019s declaration of withdrawal is a fact of a kind to provide a solution of the matter.\n26.

SCOPE OF THE CASE BEFORE THE COURT\n28. In their application to the Commission Mr Powell and Mr Rayner alleged violation of their right to respect for their private life and their home (Article 8 of the Convention) (art. 8), of their right of property (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1) (P1-1), of their right of access to the courts in civil matters (Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention) (art. 6-1) and of their right to an effective remedy under domestic law for alleged breaches of the Convention (Article 13 of the Convention) (art. 13).\nAccording to the terms of its decisions of 17 October 1985 and 16 July 1986 the Commission declared all these complaints inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded with the exception of the complaint under Article 13 (art. 13) (see paragraph 25 above). Nonetheless, in the applicants\u2019 submission, \u201cthe Court has jurisdiction to consider the alleged violations of Articles 8 and 6 (art. 8, art. 6), independently of the alleged violation of Article 13 (art. 13)\u201c (see paragraph 9 in fine of the applicants\u2019 memorial). The issue under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) was not pursued after the admissibility stage.\n29. The compass of the case before the Court is delimited by the Commission\u2019s decision on admissibility (see, as the most recent authority, the Kamasinski judgment of 19 December 1989, Series A no. 168, p. 30, \u00a7 59).

THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Vaud Code of Criminal Procedure\n20. The confidentiality of judicial investigations is governed by Articles 184 and 185 of the Vaud Code of Criminal Procedure, which provide:\nArticle 184\n\u201cAll judicial investigations shall remain confidential until they are finally completed.\nJudges, other members of the national legal service and civil servants shall not communicate any documents or information about an investigation except to experts, other witnesses or an authority where such communication assists the investigation or is justified on administrative or judicial grounds.\u201c\nArticle 185\n\u201cThe parties, their counsel, employees of their counsel and experts and witnesses shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of an investigation, on pain of a fine of up to five hundred francs, unless the breach is punishable under other provisions.\nThe punishment provided for in the foregoing paragraph shall be ordered by the President of the Cassation Division, of his own motion or acting on an information.\nHe shall give his ruling after a summary investigation.\u201c\nIn 1983 the applicant was the sponsor of a constitutional initiative entitled \u201cFor a system of criminal justice with a human face\u201c, one of whose aims was to secure the repeal of Article 185. This was in line with the approach adopted by those who had drafted the 1977 Geneva Code of Criminal Procedure, which does not attach any penalty to the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of an investigation, an obligation from which it even completely exempts witnesses, complainants, accused persons and their lawyers. In a referendum on 20 May 1984 the people of the Canton of Vaud rejected the Weber initiative by a clear majority.\n#### B. The Swiss Criminal Code\n21. Article 293 \u00a7 1 of the Swiss Criminal Code - which was not applied in the instant case (see paragraph 19 above) - provides:\n\u201cAnyone who, without being entitled to do so, makes public all or part of the proceedings of an investigation or of the deliberations of any authority which are confidential by law or in virtue of a decision taken by such an authority acting within its powers shall be punished with imprisonment or a fine.\u201c\n#### C. The Vaud cantonal Fines (Recovery and Conversion into Imprisonment) Order of 23 January 1942\n22. The cantonal Order of 23 January 1942, which has been supplemented and amended several times since, provides, inter alia:\nArticle 8\n\u201cIf the person convicted has neither paid nor redeemed the fine and if it appears that recovery proceedings would be fruitless, the Prefect shall convert the fine into a term of imprisonment.\n...\nThe Prefect may, however, decide against conversion at any time if the person convicted proves that, through no fault of his own, he is unable to pay the fine.\u201c\nArticle 12\n\u201cThe conversion rate shall be one day\u2019s imprisonment for every thirty francs of fine; fractions of less than thirty francs shall be left out of account; the length of imprisonment shall not excee", "001-57631": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF OBERMEIER v.

THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. Substantive law\n(a) The law of contract\n43. Employment contracts are governed by the general law of contract (Articles 859 et seq. of the Civil Code, Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) and in particular by the provisions on contracts for services (Dienstvertrag, Articles 1151 et seq. of the Code), supplemented by the Private Employees Act (Angestelltengesetz, Bundesgesetzblatt no. 292/1921 as amended). Section 27 of that Act provides that a person may be dismissed only on certain specific grounds, which it lists.\n44. As a general rule, employment contracts are concluded on the basis of collective agreements (Kollektivvertr\u00e4ge), whose terms form part of the conditions of employment, unless otherwise stipulated in the individual contract. The Collective Agreement for Administrative Employees of Insurance Undertakings (Kollektivvertrag f\u00fcr Angestellte der Versicherungsunternehmen - Innendienst), which was applicable in this instance, lays down the principle that, with very few exceptions, a permanent employee may be dismissed only after disciplinary proceedings (clause 33 \u00a7 4). One of the exceptions is \u201cadministrative retirement\u201c (administrative Pensionierung), provided for in clause 33 \u00a7 9. Among the conditions to which such a measure is subject is the prior consent of the works council.\n45. Clause 32 of the agreement concerns \u201csuspension\u201c (Suspendierung), and is worded as follows:\n\u201c(1) Suspension does not constitute a penalty, but is a preventive administrative measure which may be imposed by management in the following cases:\n(a) where a criminal or disciplinary investigation is being conducted against an employee;\n(b) where there has been a gross failure to show due respect and proper deference to hierarchical superiors;\n(c) where it appears necessary on grounds of safety at work and in the interests of the undertaking.\n(2) During the period of his suspension, the employee shall continue to be paid his salary. In addition he shall continue to be entitled to promotion on grounds of seniority.\u201c\n(b) Dismissal of employees in general\n46. The dismissal of employees is governed in principle by section 105 of the Industrial Relations Act (Arbeitsverfassungsgesetz, Bundesgesetzblatt no. 22/1974).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n27. The Land Acquisition Act 1979 was enacted in order to implement the agricultural guidelines adopted by the Riksdag in 1977 and also to meet the policy goals of forestry and regional planning. Among the aims to be specially furthered by the Act are the creation and preservation of viable family holdings so as to strengthen the connection between cultivation and ownership, and also the promotion of a continuous structural rationalisation of agriculture and forestry.\n28. Under section 1 of the Act, a permit is required for the acquisition of real estate assessed for tax purposes as an agricultural holding. Section 2 lists a number of exceptions: for example, no permit is required when the property is acquired by a State authority other than a commercial undertaking (sub-section 2) or at a compulsory sale by auction (sub-section 10) other than such as take place in accordance with section 17 of the Act (see paragraph 36 below).\n29. When deciding on an application for a permit, the authorities shall take into account that the setting up and development of rational enterprises in agriculture, forestry and horticulture should be promoted (section 3).\n30. Section 4 para. 1 provides that a permit to acquire a property shall be refused, inter alia:\n\u201c1. If the price or other consideration exceeds, to an extent which is not insignificant, the value of the property in view of its yield and other circumstances,\n2. if it can be assumed that the acquisition is effected mainly as an investment,\n3. if the property is required for the rationalisation of agriculture or forestry,\n...\u201c\nParagraph 2 of this section provides inter alia that sub-section 1 of the first paragraph does not apply to the acquisition of real estate at a compulsory sale by auction under section 17 of the Act (see paragraph 36 below).\n31. Section 12 specifies that the acquisition permit shall, in principle, be applied for within three months of the purchase. Under this section the question whether or not to grant the permit may not be examined before the acquisition, except in certain circumstances, none of which obtained at the 1979 auction.\nHowever, in the case of a public auction under section 17 (see paragraph 36 below), such as the one held in 1985, the acquisition permit shall be issued before the auction.\n32. Under section 16 para. 1, a property acquired at a compulsory auction in circumstances which, in case of an ordinary purchase (see paragraph 28 above), would have required a permit shall be re-sold within two years, unless the said circumstances have by then ceased to exist or unless the purchaser has obtained a permit from the County Agricultural Board t", "001-57642": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF DARBY v.

The provisions regarding municipal income taxation in general are included in the Municipal Tax Act 1928, which has been amended on numerous occasions over the years. The references below to this Act and to other enactments are all to the version in force during the relevant period (1979-1981), unless otherwise stated.\n18. Liability to pay tax in Sweden was regulated in section 53, subsection 1, of the Municipal Tax Act: residents of Sweden were taxed on their world-wide income whereas non-residents had a more limited liability, covering, inter alia, income derived from employment in the Swedish public service.\nUnder Article 19 of the convention with Finland for the avoidance of double taxation (published in svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling (\u201cSFS\u201c - the official journal), 1977:812), the right to tax income derived from public service vested in the State which paid the remuneration (with certain exceptions not relev", "001-57644": "\ufeff\nCOURT (PLENARY)\nCASE OF HUBER v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 3 (art. 5-3)\n37. The applicant alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3) of the Convention inasmuch as it secured to \u201ceveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c)\u201c of Article 5 (art. 5-1-c) the right to be \u201cbrought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power\u201c.\nIn her submission, District Attorney J. did not provide the necessary guarantee of independence because he ordered her detention on remand, then indicted her and finally assumed the role of prosecuting authority in the trial court.\nMrs Huber argued further that in general a prosecutor (Ankl\u00e4ger) could never be regarded as an \u201cofficer\u201c within the meaning of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3). In the present case, of the various functions a District Attorney was called upon to perform, that of prosecution predominated; the duty to establish incriminating and exonerating evidence with equal care made no difference in this respect.\n38. The Commission took the view that Mr J. could not be regarded as independent of the parties to the trial because he could be one of them and indeed was.\nIts Delegate invited the Court to depart from the Schiesser judgment of 4 December 1979 (Series A no. 34), which also concerned the status and duties of the District Attorney of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 November 1990, as a Chamber, and on 23 January and 25 April 1991 in plenary session,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Substantive law applicable\n##### 1. The offence of defamation\n25. Article 111 of the Criminal Code provides:\n\u201c1. Anyone who in such a way that it may be perceived by a third person accuses another of possessing a contemptible character or attitude or of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and of such a nature as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ...\n2. Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ...\n3. The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. As regards the offence defined in paragraph 1, he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to assume that the statement was true.\u201c\nUnder Article 112, \u201cevidence of the truth and of good faith shall not be admissible unless the person making the statement pleads the correctness of the statement or his good faith ...\u201c.\nUnder Article 114 para. 1 \u201cconduct of the kind mentioned in Article 111 ... is justified if it constitutes the fulfilment of a legal duty or the exercise of a right\u201c. Under paragraph 2 of the same provision \u201ca person who is forced for special reasons to make an allegation within the meaning of Article 111 ... in the particular form and manner in which it was made, is not to be punished, unless that allegation is untrue and the offender could have been aware thereof if he had acted with the necessary care\u201c.\n##### 2. The relevant provisions of the Media Act\n26. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher in cases of defamation; the victim can thus claim compensation from him. Furthermore, the publisher may be declared to be liable jointly and severally with the person convicted of a media offence for the fines imposed and for the costs of the proceedings (section 35).\nThe person defamed may request the forfeiture of the publication by which a media offence has been committed (section 33). Under section 36 he may also request the immediate seizure of such a publication if section 33 is likely to be applied subsequently, unless the adverse consequences of seizure would be disproportionate to the legal interest to be protected by this measure. Seizure shall not be ordered if that interest can instead be protected by the publication of information that criminal proceedings have been instituted (section 37). Finally, the victim may request the publication of the judgment in so far as this appears necessary for the information of the public (section 34).\n#### B. Procedural provisions applicable\n##### 1. Criminal information\n27. The first sentence of Article 86 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:\n\u201cAnybody who acquires knowledge of criminal conduct such as automatically attracts public prosecution shall have the right to report it.\u201c\nFurthermore, section 3 (g) para. 2 of the Prohibition Act imposes a duty to denounce offences under this Act in certain circumstances. Failure to fulfil this duty may be punished by imprisonment for between five and ten years.\n##### 2. Defamation proceedings\n28. Under the special simplified procedure - which was followed in this instance -, if a single judge of the Regional Court is of the opinion that the facts of the case do not constitute a criminal offence, he shall seek a decision by the Review Chamber of the Regional Court (Article 485 para. 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure), which shall order the discontinuance of the proceedings if it shares his view (Article 486 para. 3). The prosecution may appeal against such an order (Article 486 para. 4). If the Court of Appeal upholds the appeal and refers the case back to the Regional Court, the following special rules apply:\nArticle 486 para. 5\n\u201cThe trial court shall not be bound by decisions of the Review Chamber or of the court of second instance which confirm ... that the facts constitute a criminal offence ...\u201c\nArticle 489 para.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 March and 25 September 1991,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The \u201cprocureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201c\u2018s department at the Belgian Court of Cassation\n16. According to Article 141 of the Judicial Code:\n\u201cThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation shall not act as prosecuting authority except where he has instituted proceedings in which the decision on the merits falls to the Court of Cassation.\u201c\nThis provision replaced Article 37 of the Prince Sovereign\u2019s Decree of 15 March 1815, which was in issue in the Delcourt case (already cited, see paragraph 3 above) and which was worded as follows:\n\u201cEven in criminal proceedings, the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the court cannot be regarded as a party; his role is only to make submissions (conclusions), except where he has himself appealed. In the latter event, he shall put the prosecution case (r\u00e9quisitoire) in pleadings which, filed with the registry, shall be forwarded without further formalities to the rapporteur appointed by the First President and then distributed with the report to the members of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department.\u201c\nIt is true that where the Court of Cassation hears a case on its merits, the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department assumes the role of a party, but these instances are quite rare. They include the trial of ministers (Article 90 of the Constitution), civil proceedings brought against a judge in his official capacity (la prise \u00e0 partie) (Article 613, 2o, and Articles 1140 to 1147 of the Judicial Code) and disciplinary proceedings against certain judicial officers (Articles 409, 410 and 615 of the same Code).\nApart from these exceptional circumstances, the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation carries out, with full independence, the duties of adviser to the Court. In this capacity, it is by no means unusual for it to express the opinion that the court should dismiss an appeal lodged by the prosecuting authorities of the lower court or should allow an appeal by an accused; indeed it may even raise an argument against the conviction or sentence of its own motion.\n17. On the procedure to be followed in the Court of Cassation, whether for civil or criminal proceedings, the Judicial Code provides as follows:\nArticle 1107\n\u201cAfter the report has been read out, submissions are taken from the lawyers present at the hearing. Their pleadings shall relate exclusively to the issues of law raised in the grounds for appeal or to the pleas in bar put forward against the appeal.\nThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department shall then make its submissions, whereafter no further documents shall be accepted.\u201c\nArticle 1109\n\u201cThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or a member of his department shall be entitled to attend the deliberations unless the appeal on a point of law has been lodged by the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department itself; he shall not be entitled to vote in the deliberations.\u201c\nThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department may file an appeal on a point of law either \u201cin the interests of the law\u201c (Articles 1089 and 1090 of the Judicial Code and Article 442 of the Code of Criminal Procedure) or following a complaint by the Minister of Justice (Article 1088 of the Judicial Code and Article 441 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).\nThe rule which, in such cases, requires the exclusion from the Court\u2019s deliberations of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or his representative already applied under the Prince Sovereign\u2019s Decree of 15 March 1815 (see paragraph 16 above), but it was not expressly laid down therein (see the transcript of the hearing of 30 September 1969 in the Delcourt case, Series B, no. 9, p. 215). It merely provided, in Article 39:\n\u201cIn cassation proceedings the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or a member of his department shall have the right to be present, without voting, when the court retires to consider its decision.\u201c\n#### B. Disciplinary rules governing the judiciary\n##### 1. The judicial officials of the \u201cminist\u00e8re public\u201c\n18. Under Article 400 of the Judicial Code the disciplinary hierarchy applying to the officials of the minist\u00e8re public is as follows:\n\u201cThe Minister of Justice shall exercise supervisory authority over all the officials of the minist\u00e8re public, the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation over his counterparts at the Courts of Appeal and the latter over public prosecutors and their departments in their courts and the lower courts as well as over State counsel in the Industrial Appeals Tribunals, the crown prosecutors and the State counsel in the industrial tribunals and their substitutes.\u201c\nThe above provision replaced section 154 of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act of 1869, referred to in the Delcourt judgment (cited above, Series A no. 11, p. 16, para. 30).\nArticle 414 of the Judicial Code states as follows:\n\u201cThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Appeal may impose on the subordinate officials of the minist\u00e8re public the sanctions of a warning, a reprimand or a reprimand with suspension of salary.\nThe procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation shall have the same powers in regard to persons holding the office of avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at that court and those holding the office of procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Courts of Appeal.\nThe Minister of Justice may likewise warn and reprimand all the officials of the minist\u00e8re public or recommend to the King their suspension or their revocation.\u201c\n##### 2. Judges\n19. On the question of disciplinary proceedings against judges and the role in this matter of the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation, the following provisions of the Judicial Code may be cited:\nArticle 409\n\u201cOnly the Court of Cassation may hear disciplinary proceedings to remove a judge from office.\u201c\nArticle 413\n\u201cSubstitute judges\u201c - such as Mr Borgers from 1976 to 1981 (see paragraph 10 above) - \u201care, in that capacity, subject to the same disciplinary authorities as full judges.\u201c\nArticle 418\n\u201c[...] disciplinary proceedings [...] against judges [...] shall be instituted by the competent authority of its own motion; if their object is the issue of a warning, they shall be instituted by the authority empowered to order such a measure; in other cases, they shall be instituted by the first president of the competent court. Disciplinary proceedings may always be instituted at the instance of officers of the minist\u00e8re public.\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n20. In his application of 5 December 1985 to the Commission (no. 12005/86), Mr Borgers relied inter alia on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. He complained that an avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Court of Cassation had attended the deliberations of that court; in his view, this had infringed his right to a fair trial and violated the principle of the equality of arms. He subsequently criticised, in addition, the fact that he had not been able to reply to that official\u2019s submissions or address the court last at the hearing on 18 June 1985 (see paragraph 15 above).\n21. On 12 April 1989 the Commission declared these complaints admissible, while finding the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 17 May 1990 (Article 31 of the Convention) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fourteen votes to one, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of its opinion and of the separate opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\n22. Mr Borgers alleged a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art.6-1), according to which:\n\u201cIn the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an ... impartial tribunal ...\u201c\nHe complained in the first place that, at the hearing on 18 June 1985 in the Court of Cassation (see paragraph 15 above), he had been unable to reply to the submissions of the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral or to address the court last; secondly, he objected to the fact that the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral had participated in the deliberations which took place immediately after the hearing. He argued that as, in accordance with Articles 400 and 414 of the Judicial Code (see paragraph 18 above), the minist\u00e8re public formed a single unit for institutional and disciplinary purposes, the official in question could indeed have been seen as his opponent. That official\u2019s presence at the deliberations had served only to aggravate the breach of the principle of equality of arms which had already occurred at the stage of argument.\nThe Commission shared this opinion in substance and invited the Court to reconsider the view taken in its judgment in the Delcourt case of 17 January 1970 (paragraph 3 above).\n23. According to the Government, on the other hand, the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u2019s department at the Court of Cassation could not be considered equivalent to the prosecutor\u2019s offices of the lower courts.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 March and 26 June 1990,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Introduction\n15. For the past 20 years the population of Northern Ireland, which totals 1.5 million people, has been subjected to a campaign of terrorism (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, pp. 9-31, \u00a7\u00a7 11-77, and the Brogan and Others judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 21, \u00a7 25). More than 2,750 people, including almost 800 members of the security forces, have been killed and 31,900 more have been maimed or injured. The campaign of terror has extended to the rest of the United Kingdom and to the mainland of Europe.\nSpecial legislation has been introduced in an attempt to deal with this situation in Northern Ireland. Thus, the 1978 Act and its predecessors, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973 (\u201cthe 1973 Act\u201c) and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment) Act 1975 (\u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c), were enacted to enable the security forces to deal more effectively with the threat of terrorism.\n#### B. Section 11 of the 1978 Act\n16. Section 11 of the 1978 Act conferred, inter alia, a power of arrest. The relevant parts of section 11, which was repealed in 1987, provided as follows:\n\u201c1. Any constable may arrest without warrant any person whom he suspects of being a terrorist.\n...\n3. A person arrested under this section shall not be detained in right of the arrest for more than seventy-two hours after his arrest, and section 132 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act (Northern Ireland) 1964 and section 50(3) of the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 (requirement to bring arrested person before a magistrates\u2019 court not later than forty-eight hours after his arrest) shall not apply to any such person.\u201c\nSub-section (2) gave a power to enter and search premises where a suspected terrorist was or was suspected of being. Under sub-section (4) persons arrested under section 11 could be photographed and their finger prints and palm prints taken by a constable.\n17. Section 31 (1) of the 1978 Act defines \u201cterrorist\u201c and \u201cterrorism\u201c. A terrorist is \u201ca person who is or has been concerned in the commission or attempted commission of any act of terrorism or in directing, organising or training persons for the purpose of terrorism\u201c. Terrorism is defined as \u201cthe use of violence for political ends and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear\u201c.\nUnder section 21 of, and Schedule 2 to, the 1978 Act, certain organisations - one of which is the IRA, the Provisional IRA included - are proscribed organisations. It is an offence to belong to or profess to belong to such an organisation, to solicit or incite support for any such organisation, knowingly to make or receive any contribution to it, to solicit or invite a person to become a member or to carry out on its behalf orders or directions or requests by a member of the organisation.\n18. The powers of arrest and detention under section 11 of the 1978 Act were originally an integral part of the scheme of interim custody introduced by the 1973 Act to replace internment (see the Irela", "001-57775": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF EDWARDS v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 June and 25 November 1992,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Duty of prosecution to disclose certain information to the defence\n17. Under the Attorney General\u2019s Guidelines issued in December 1981, the prosecution is obliged (subject to specified discretionary exceptions) to disclose to the defence \u201cunused material\u201c, which includes all witness statements not enclosed in the bundle of statements served on the defence at the stage of committal of the case by the Magistrates\u2019 Court to the Crown Court.\nThe prosecution is also under a duty to inform the defence of any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial (R. v. Clarke [1930] 22 Criminal Appeal Reports 58). Consequently where evidence of a prosecution witness is given before the court stating that the witness would recognise the accused again, and the prosecution knows that when shown a photograph of the accused the witness in fact failed to identify him, it is required to inform the defence of that fact.\nFor the purpose, among others, of ensuring compliance with this duty, the Court of Appeal has stated that all the statements which have been taken by the police should be put before counsel for the Crown, and that it should not be left to the police to decide which statements he is to receive (R. v. Fellowes, 12 July 1985).\n#### B. Jury verdicts\n18. A jury\u2019s verdict may be either unanimous or by a majority. It must be unanimous unless the trial judge, in accordance with section 17 of the Juries Act 1974, has directed, after at least two hours of unsuccessful jury deliberations, that a majority verdict will be accepted. A majority verdict will be effective if, where there are not less than eleven jurors, ten of them agree on the verdict, or, where there are ten jurors, nine of them agree. If the jury do not agree on either a unanimous or majority verdict, they may, at the discretion of the trial judge, be discharged, but such a discharge does not amount to acquittal and the accused may be tried again by a second jury.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Deprivation of liberty\n##### 1. Pre-trial detention\n40. Article 180 (1) and (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the version in force at the time, permits the pre-trial detention of a person (where there are serious reasons for suspecting him of having committed a criminal offence) if there is a danger of absconding, collusion or repetition of offences.\n41. The risk of absconding cannot be presumed if the accused is liable to a penalty of not more than five years\u2019 imprisonment, is living in normal conditions and has a permanent address in Austria, unless he has already attempted to abscond (Article 180 (3)).\n42. The accused can bring an application for release at any time (Article 194 (2)). Under Articles 194 and 195 the request is examined by the Review Chamber of the Regional Court at a hearing in private, in the presence of the accused or his lawyer. If the accused or the public prosecutor\u2019s office appeals to the Court of Appeal, the hearing also takes place in private, in the presence of a member of the principal public prosecutor\u2019s office, but in the absence of the accused and his lawyer.\nIf no such application is made by the accused, the Review Chamber of its own motion reviews the detention when it has lasted for two months or where three months have passed since the last hearing and the accused has no lawyer (Article 194 (3)).\nAfter the definitive indictment or the fixing of the hearing date for the trial, these review hearings cease. Decisions on the continuation of the detention are now taken by the trial court during the hearing and by the Review Chamber, sitting in private, at other times (Article 194 (4)).\n43. Detention on remand is terminated at the latest at the time when a person who has been convicted begins to serve his sentence; the time spent in detention on remand is automatically deducted from the sentence (Article 38 of the Criminal Code).\n##### 2. Provisional placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders\n44. In two cases specified in Articles 429 (4) and 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, pre-trial detention may take the form of placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders:\nArticle 429 (4)\n\u201cIf one of the reasons for detention specified in Article 180 (2) or (7) exists, or if the person concerned cannot remain at liberty without there being a danger for himself or other persons, or if medical observation of him is necessary, an order shall be made for his provisional detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders or for his admission to a public hospital for mental illnesses ...\u201c\nArticle 438\n\u201cIf there are sufficient reasons for presuming that the conditions in [Article] 21 (2) ... of the Criminal Code are fulfilled, and if reasons for detention (Article 180 (2) and (7)) exist, but the accused cannot without difficulty be detained in the prison of a court, an order shall be made that detention on remand is to take the form of provisional placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders ...\u201c\n##### 3. Placement in an institution for mentally ill offenders (preventive measures)\n45. Under Article 21 of the Criminal Code:\n\u201c(1) If a person commits an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and if he cannot be punished for the sole reason that he committed the offence under the influence of a state of mind excluding responsibility (Article 11) resulting from a serious mental or emotiona", "001-57791": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF PHAM HOANG v.

Heroin is the most strictly prohibited commodity in customs terms and the most harmful under health legislation; 2. ... the offence was committed by a group of six or more individuals (Art. 416 of the CC);\n3. ... the goods were to be transported by a self- propelled vehicle (Art. 416 of the CC).\nSPECIAL FEATURES OF CUSTOMS LAW\nArt. 373 of the CC: in any proceedings concerning a seizure of goods, it shall be for the person whose goods have been seized to prove that he has not committed an offence.\nThe defendants cannot avoid their criminal liability by relying on their good faith, since the latter is of absolutely no effect in customs law.\nArt. 409 of the CC: any attempted offence is punishable in the same way as the offence itself. Delivery was going to be taken of the smuggled goods in Pham\u2019s vehicle by Pham, Ngo and Tran.\nLIABILITY\nThe offence described above is imputable to the above-mentioned persons as being in possession - in possession in law - or having an interest in customs evasion.\nA person in possession of smuggled goods is deemed responsible for customs evasion (Art. 392 para. 1 of the CC).\nBy Art. 399 of the CC,\n1. Anyone who as a person having an interest has taken part in any way in a smuggling offence or an offence of undeclared importation or exportation is liable to the same penalties as anyone committing the offence and, furthermore, to the loss of rights provided for in Article 432 of the Customs Code.\n2. The following are deemed to have an interest:\n(a) owners and members of business undertakings, insurers, insurance policyholders, moneylenders, owners of goods and in general anyone who has a direct interest in customs evasion;\n(b) anyone who has contributed in any way to a series of acts committed by a number of individuals acting in concert, in accordance with a customs-evasion plan drawn up in order to achieve the jointly pursued purpose;\n(c) anyone who has knowingly concealed the activities of smugglers or attempted to help them evade punishment or has purchased or possessed, even outside the customs zone, goods obtained by means of a smuggling offence or an offence of undeclared importation.\n3. An interest in customs evasion cannot be imputed to anyone who has acted from necessity or as a result of an unavoidable mistake.\nWhere more than one person is found guilty of a single customs-evasion offence, they are jointly and severally liable for the penalties, both as regards pecuniary penalties in lieu of forfeiture and as regards fines and costs (Art. 406 para. 1 of the CC).\nThe owners of smuggled goods, anyone who has undertaken to import or export them, anyone with an interest in the customs evasion, accomplices and adherents are all jointl", "001-57804": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF COSTELLO-ROBERTS v.

THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The use of corporal punishment\n13. In English law, at the relevant time, there were various criminal offences of assault, the penalties for which differed according to the gravity of the offence and the court in which it was tried. The law has since been amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1988.\nProsecution for common assault, the least serious form of assault, was normally brought by or on behalf of the aggrieved party in accordance with section 42 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, as amended (\u201cthe 1861 Act\u201c). Section 45 of the 1861 Act barred any further or other proceedings, civil or criminal, for the same cause. Consequently, the Crown did not normally undertake a prosecution for common assault, thus ensuring that the choice between criminal and civil proceedings remained with the victim of the alleged assault.\nIn the Magistrates\u2019 Court the maximum penalty for common assault was a fine of \u00a3400 or two months\u2019 imprisonment. In cases of \u201caggravated\u201c common assault, namely where committed upon a male child no more than fourteen years old or any female, the maximum penalty was a higher fine or six months\u2019 imprisonment. In the Crown Court the maximum penalty on conviction increased to one year\u2019s imprisonment.\nAssault occasioning actual bodily harm, a more serious form of assault, was and still is governed, in particular, by section 47 of the 1861 Act. Prosecutions are normally undertaken by the Crown and the penalty on conviction is a maximum term of five years\u2019 imprisonment.\nIn addition, it is an offence under section 1(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 to assault or ill-treat a child in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health. The maximum penalty on conviction is a fine or ten years\u2019 imprisonment.\n14. Under the civil law, if no criminal prosecution has been brought for common assault, physical assault is actionable as a form of trespass to the person, giving the aggrieved party the right to recovery of damages. Civil proceedings arising out of the use of immoderate or unreasonable corporal punishment by a teacher will lie either against him or his employer - i.e. the school or school authorities.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 November 1992 and 22 April 1993,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Introduction\n12. The emergency situation in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s and the attendant level of terrorist activity form the background to the introduction of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 (\u201cthe 1974 Act\u201c). Between 1972 and 1992, over three thousand deaths were attributable to terrorism in Northern Ireland. In the mid 1980s, the number of deaths was significantly lower than in the early 1970s but organised terrorism has continued to grow.\nSince the commencement of the terrorist campaign there have been 35,104 people injured in Northern Ireland as a result of terrorist acts. Many of these injuries involved loss of limbs and permanent physical disability. In the same period there have been a total of 41,859 terrorist shooting or bombing incidents. Other parts of the United Kingdom have also been subjected to a considerable scale of terrorist violence.\n13. The 1974 Act came into force on 29 November 1974. The Act proscribed the Irish Republican Army (\u201cIRA\u201c) and made it an offence to display support in public of that organisation in Great Britain. The IRA was already a proscribed organisation in Northern Ireland. The Act also conferred special powers of arrest and detention on the police so that they could deal more effectively with the threat of terrorism (see paragraphs 16-17 below).\nThis Act was subject to renewal every six months by Parliament so that, inter alia, the need for the continued use of the special powers could be monitored. The Act was thus renewed until March 1976, when it was re-enacted with certain amendments.\nUnder section 17 of the 1976 Act, the special powers were subject to parliamentary renewal every twelve months. The 1976 Act was in turn renewed annually until 1984, when it was re-enacted with certain amendments. The 1984 Act, which came into force in March 1984, proscribed the Irish National Liberation Army as well as the IRA. It was renewed every year until replaced by the 1989 Act which came into force on 27 March 1989. Section 14 of the 1989 Act contains provisions similar to those contained in section 12 of the 1984 Act.\n14. The 1976 Act was reviewed by Lord Shackleton in a report published in July 1978 and subsequently by Lord Jellicoe in a report published in January 1983. Annual reports on the 1984 Act have been presented to Parliament by Sir Cyril Philips (for 1984 and 1985) and Viscount Colville (from 1986-1991). A wider-scale review of the operation of the 1984 Act was also carried out by Viscount Colville in 1987.\n15. These reviews were commissioned by the Government and presented to Parliament to assist consideration of the continued need for the legislation. The authors of these reports concluded in particular that in view of the problems inherent in the prevention and investigation of terrorism, the continued use of the special powers of arrest and detention was indispensable. The suggestion that decisions extending detention should be taken by the courts was rejected, notably because the information grounding those decisions was highly sensitive and could not be disclosed to the persons in detention or their legal advisers. For various reasons, the decisions were considered to fall properly within the sphere of the executive.\nIn his 1987 report reviewing the provisions of section 12, Viscount Colville considered that good reasons existed for extending detention in certain cases beyond forty-eight hours and up to seven days. He noted in this regard that the police in Northern Ireland were frequently confronted by a situation where they had good intelligence to connect persons with a terrorist incident but the persons concerned, if detained, made no statements, and witnesses were afraid to come forward, certainly in court: in these circumstances, it was concluded, the reliance on forensic evidence by the prosecution was increasing, and detective work had assumed a higher degree of importance. He also set out the reasons which individually or, as often, in combination constituted good grounds for extending the various periods within which otherwise persons suspected of involvement in terrorism would have to be charged or taken to court. These included checking of fingerprints; forensic tests; checking the detainee\u2019s replies against intelligence; new lines of inquiry; information obtained from one or more than one other detainee in the same case; finding and consulting other witnesses (Command Paper 264, paragraphs 5.1.5-5.1.7, December 1987).\n#### B. Power to arrest without warrant under the 1984 and other Acts\n16. The relevant provisions of section 12 of the 1984 Act, substantially the same as those of the 1974 and 1976 Acts, are as follows:\n\u201c12. (1) [A] constable may arrest without warrant a person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be\n...\n(b) a person who is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism to which this Part of this Act applies;\n...\n(3) The acts of terrorism to which this Part of this Act applies are\n(a) acts of terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland;\n...\n(4) A person arrested under this section shall not be detained in right of the arrest for more than forty-eight hours after his arrest; but the Secretary of State may, in any particular case, extend the period of forty-eight hours by a period or periods specified by him.\n(5) Any such further period or periods shall not exceed five days in all.\n(6) The following provisions (requirement to bring accused person before the court after his arrest) shall not apply to a person detained in right of the arrest\n...\n(d) Article 131 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981;\n...\n(8) The provisions of this section are without prejudice to any power of arrest exercisable apart from this section.\u201c\n17. According to the definition given in section 14 (1) of the 1984 Act, \u201cterrorism means the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear\u201c. An identical definition of terrorism in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 was held to be \u201cin wide terms\u201c by the House of Lords, which rejected an interpretation of the word \u201cterrorist\u201c that would have been \u201cin narrower terms than popular usage of the word \u2018terrorist\u2019 might connote to a police officer or a layman\u201c (McKee v. Chief Constable for Northern Ireland [1985] 1 All England Law Reports 1 at 3-4, per Lord Roskill).\n#### C. Detention under the ordinary criminal law\n18. Article 131 of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, declared inapplicable in cases of suspected terrorism by section 12(6)(d) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 16 above), provided that where a person arrested without warrant was not released from custody within twenty-four hours, he had to be brought before a Magistrates\u2019 Court as soon as practicable thereafter but not later than forty-eight hours after his arrest.\n19. Article 131 was repealed by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/1341 (Northern Ireland) 12). Under the provisions of the 1989 Order (which corresponds directly with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 in force in England and Wales) a person arrested on suspicion of his involvement in an offence may initially not be kept in police detention for more than twenty-four hours without being charged (Article 42(1)). On the authority of a police officer of the rank of Superintendent or above, the detention may be extended for a period not exceeding thirty-six hours from the time of arrest, or arrival at a police station after arrest, when the officer concerned:\n\u201c... has reasonable grounds for believing that -\n(a) the detention of that person without charge is necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which he is under arrest or to obtain such evidence by questioning him;\n(b) an offence for which he is under arrest is a serious arrestable offence;\n(c) the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.\u201c (Article 43(1))\nBy Article 44(1) of the Order a Magistrates\u2019 Court is empowered, on a complaint in writing by a constable, to extend the period of police detention if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of that person is justified. Detention is only justified for these purposes if the conditions set out in (a)-(c) above are satisfied (Article 44(4)). The person to whom the complaint relates must be furnished with a copy of the complaint and brought before the court for the hearing (Article 44(2)) and is entitled to be legally represented at the hearing (Article 44(3)). The period of further detention authorised by the warrant may not exceed thirty-six hours (Article 44(12)). By Article 45 a Magistrates\u2019 Court may, on a complaint in writing by a constable, extend the period of detention for such period as the court thinks fit, having regard to the evidence before it (Article 45(1), (2)). This additional extension may not exceed thirty-six hours and may not end later than ninety-si", "001-57825": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF HOFFMANN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Civil Code\n18. Article 177 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) deals with the custody of children in an event such as the dissolution of their parents\u2019 marriage by divorce. It reads:\n\u201c(1) Where the marriage between the parents of a legitimate minor has been dissolved, annulled or declared void, or where the parents are separated other than merely for a temporary period, they may submit to the court an agreement concerning which of them shall in the future have custody of the child. The court shall approve the agreement if it is in the interests of the child\u2019s welfare.\n(2) Where no agreement is reached within a reasonable time, or if the agreement reached is not in the interest of the child\u2019s welfare, the court shall decide which parent is to have sole custody of the child in the future; in the case of a separation of the parents which is not merely temporary, such a decision shall be taken only on application by one of them.\u201c\n19. Both during and after the parents\u2019 marriage, the court may be called upon to substitute its approval or consent for that of the parents (or parent). The relevant provision is Article 176, which reads:\n\u201cWhere the conduct of the parents threatens the welfare of a minor, the court shall be required, irrespective of who has applied to it, to make the orders necessary for the protection of the child\u2019s welfare. Such an order may also be made on application by one of the parents when the parents have failed to reach an agreement concerning a matter of importance to the child. In particular the court may withdraw custody of a child, either wholly or in part, including rights of approval and consent provided by law. In individual cases the court is also required to substitute its approval or consent for parental approval or consent required by law, when there is no justified reason for refusal.\u201c\n20. In taking decisions under Articles 176 and 177, the courts follow the criteria set out in Article 178a, which reads:\n\u201cIn assessing the interests of the minor, his or her personality and needs must be duly taken into consideration, particularly his or her talents, abilities, inclinations and developmental opportunities, as well as the material circumstances of the parents.\u201c\n#### B.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 March and 24 August 1993,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. THE FIRST APPLICANT\n#### A. Alleged violation of article 3 (art. 3)\n23. The first applicant, Mrs Klaas, alleged that the treatment to which she had been subjected by the police officers in the course of her arrest constituted inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3), according to which:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201c\nShe maintained that, as a result of the altercation with the police, she had sustained, inter alia, injuries to her head and shoulder. These were supported by medical evidence (see paragraph 8 above) and were also illustrated by the photographs submitted to the Court by the Delegate of the Commission immediately prior to the hearing.\n24. The Commission accepted her allegation. In accordance with the view expressed by the national courts, it was of the opinion that her arrest had been lawful (see paragraphs 13, 16 and 18 above). However, even assuming that she had resisted arrest and had been attempting to abscond, it considered that the use of force by police officers resulting in serious injuries had to be seen as inhuman and degrading treatment if it could not be shown by the Government that the force used was necessary in order for the police to accomplish their lawful duties.\nAccording to the Commission, as the first applicant was injured in the course of an arrest, while under police control, it was incumbent on the Government to produce evidence showing facts which cast doubt on the account given by the victim which was supported by photographs and medical evidence. In the absence of any convincing other explanation as to the cause of the injuries suffered during her arrest, her allegations of a disproportionate use of force seemed plausible.\n25. The Government argued that the first applicant\u2019s left shoulder had been damaged prior to the arrest, but otherwise accepted the fact that as a result she had suffered bruising to her shoulders as well as grazes on her face and her arm. They disagreed, however, with the applicant\u2019s account of how the injuries came about and maintained that the injuries were accidental and regrettable consequences of a lawful arrest.\n26. The Court notes that the parties to the national proceedings did not dispute the fact that the injuries as shown by medical evidence and illustrated by the photographs actually arose in the course of the arrest. Indeed, this was not denied by the police officers when they gave evidence before the Detmold Regional Court.\nHowever, differing versions of how those injuries actually came about have been put forward by the applicants and the Government.\nMrs Klaas claimed that she had voluntarily agreed to provide a specimen of breath and that when that had failed she had only asked that her eight year-old daughter could go and stay with her neighbour in order that she could accompany the police officers to the hospital for a blood test. She denied the police officers\u2019 allegation that there was any danger of her absconding. She insisted that the police officers were responsible for her head getting knocked against the wall, a fact corroborated by her daughter who claimed to have observed the scene through the plain glass window panel. Furthermore, she argued that the force used by the police officers was disproportionate to the aim of securing the evidence for the offence of driving under the influence of alcohol. It was not necessary for two male police officers, well-trained in dealing with situations of this kind, to have assaulted a woman in this way.\nThe Government, on the other hand, contested the allegation that the injuries were the result of a greater degree of force being used by the police officers than was necessary in the circumstances. They contended that she had inflicted the injuries upon herself as by resisting arrest and attempting to escape she had provoked the firm and rapid use of physical force against her.\n27. The Court recalls that various proceedings have arisen out of this incident, some of which have been abandoned.\nFirst, criminal proceedings were instituted against Mrs Klaas on 29 January 1986 for two separate offences of driving under the influence of drink and resisting arrest, but these were discontinued on 22 April 1986 by the public prosecutor\u2019s office at the Detmol", "001-57833": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF MELIN v.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 PARA 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION\n30. In the applicants\u2019 submission, their actions for the restitution of their assets were not heard within a reasonable time as required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. In addition, the proceedings conducted in the Constitutional Court failed to comply with the principle of equality of arms, inherent in the right to a fair trial as guaranteed under the same provision, according to which:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\nThe Government contested this view, whereas the Commission subscribed to it.\n#### A. Preliminary observations\n31. The Government contended that the applicants\u2019 complaint was directed solely at the first set of proceedings in the Constitutional Court, to which Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) did not apply; in particular, as regards compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201c requirement their initial application had cited only those proceedings.\nIt should, however, be noted that, when they lodged their application with the Commission on 5 May 1987, the Audiencia provincial of Madrid had only recently, three months earlier, declared admissible their appeal from the judgment of 23 December 1986 (see paragraph 21 above); they could not therefore at that stage complain of the ensuing delays, but they have done so since.

Italy judgment of 27 July 1987, Series A no. 119, p. 11, para. 22), the Court will therefore examine all the proceedings in issue.\n32. The applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) to the applicants\u2019 civil actions for the restitution of their assets is not open to dispute. The Government maintained, however, that the proceedings in the Constitutional Court should not be taken into account in ruling on the question of \u201creasonable time\u201c. They also claimed that the complaint as to the fairness of the latter proceedings fell outside the scope of the aforementioned provision.\nThe issue of the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) does not arise in precisely the same terms on both points.\n#### B. Compliance with the \u201creasonable time\u201c requirement\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n33. The period to be taken into consideration began on 27 May 1983, when Zoilo, Rafael, Isidoro, Alfonso and Mar\u00eda Dolores Ruiz-Mateos brought their action in respect of half the capital of RUMASA, thereby supplementing the action brought by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz-Mateos on 9 May 1983 in respect of the other half (see paragraph 12 above). It ended on 25 February 1991, the date of the judgment of the Audiencia provincial (see paragraph 24 above). Notwithstanding the applicants\u2019 arguments to the contrary, the Court does not regard their application of 6 March 1991 for the interpretation of the judgment as relevant, because it had no bearing on the outcome of the dispute.\n34. In the Government\u2019s view, two lapses of time should be deducted from the above period, one of more than twenty-six months at first instance (5 October 1984 - 19 December 1986) and another of eighteen months on appeal (9 July 1989 - 15 January 1991), when the civil courts had to wait for the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision on the questions which they had referred to it. The Government contended that the proceedings in the Constitutional Court could not be regarded as a stage in the civil proceedings. The task of the Constitutional Court was not to rule on a specific case, but to \u201crefine\u201c, from an objective point of view, domestic law by annulling rules that were contrary to the Constitution.\n35. According to the Court\u2019s well-established case-law, proceedings in a Constitutional Court are to be taken into account for calculating the relevant period where the result of such proceedings is capable of affecting the outcome of the dispute before the ordinary courts (see, inter alia, the Deumeland v. Germany judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 100, p. 26, para. 77, the Poiss v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117, p. 103, para. 52, and the Bock v. Germany judgment of 29 March 1989, Series A no. 150, p. 18, para. 37). The Court sees no grounds for departing from this line of authority so as to revert to the approach adopted in the Buchholz v. Germany judgment of 6 May 1981 (Series A no. 42, p. 15, para. 48), as it was urged to do by the respondent Government and by the German and Portuguese Governments (see paragraph 5 above).\n36. It is true that the constitutional proceedings in this case took place in mid-course of the main action and not, as in the above-mentioned cases, after its conclusion. However, in the Court\u2019s view this circumstance, on which the Government laid particular stress, on the contrary provides an additional reason for taking them into account in the calculation of the period to be considered, especially where they concern a preliminary issue (see the Giancarlo Lombardo v. Italy judgment of 26 November 1992, Series A no. 249-C, p. 43, para. 18).\nThe Government also invoked the \u201cpolitical nature\u201c of the Constitutional Court, which was not part of the judiciary. The argument is not convincing: the Court has on more than one occasion had regard to interlocutory proceedings conducted before political institutions or administrative bodies or agencies (see, inter alia, the Foti and Others v. Ita", "001-57843": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF SIBSON v.

A closed shop is an undertaking or workplace where there is in existence a \u201cunion membership agreement\u201c, that is an agreement or arrangement between one or more trade unions and one or more employers or employers\u2019 associations having the effect in practice of requiring employees of a certain class to be or become members of a specified union (section 30 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as amended).\n#### B. Unfair dismissal\n18. The Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 (\u201cthe 1978 Act\u201c) provided that, subject to exceptions not relevant to the present case, \u201cevery employee shall have the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer\u201c (section 54); the remedies for unfair dismissal were compensation or, if the individual concerned so elected and if the Industrial Tribunal in its discretion so decided, reinstatement or re-engagement (section 68). In determining whether to make a reinstatement or re-engagement order, the tribunal had to take into account, inter alia, whether it was practicable for the employer to comply therewith (section 69).\nUnder section 58(1)(c) of the 1978 Act, as substituted by section 3 of the Employment Act 1982:\n\u201cSubject to subsection (3), the dismissal of an employee by an employer shall be regarded for the purposes of this Part as having been unfair if the reason for it (or, if more than one, the principal reason) was that the employee -\n...\n(c) was not a member of any trade union, or of a particular trade union, or of one of a number of parti", "001-57847": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF ZUMTOBEL v.

THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Freedom of the Press Act\n14. In Sweden freedom of expression as regards the printed word is regulated by the 1949 Freedom of the Press Act, which has constitutional status. The first such Act dates back to 1766. The jury system was introduced when a revised version of the Act entered into force in 1812. The merits of the system underwent a thorough examination in the course of the revision which led to the 1949 version of the Act. However, the predominant view was that the jury system constituted an important safeguard of press freedom in Sweden and that it should be maintained. For similar reasons, more recent proposals to abolish the jury system have also been resisted.\n1. Organisation and jurisdiction of Swedish courts in proceedings relating to the freedom of the press\n15. Chapter 12 of the Act contains special provisions governing judicial proceedings instituted to establish civil or criminal liability for prohibited statements in print (section 1). These cases are heard by the District Court within whose jurisdiction the county administration has its seat (Chapter 12, section 1). It sits with three judges and, in proceedings brought under the Act, also with a jury of nine members to examine whether a criminal offence has been committed or whether civil liability has been incurred, unless the parties on both sides declare their willingness to have the issue determined by the court without a jury (sections 2 and 14). In any event, matters such as evidence, sentencing, damages and legal costs are dealt with by the judges alone.\nIn a jury trial the District Court is presided over by a judge. If a jury has given a negative answer to the question whether an offence has been committed or whether civil liability has been incurred, the defendant must b", "001-57862": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF ZANDER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n12. The Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Fire Brigades Act dates from 1 April 1956; it has been amended on several occasions, most recently on 10 February 1987. At the time of the events in the present case the Act was applicable as amended on 27 November 1978.\n13. The Act requires municipalities to set up proficient fire brigades which may be composed of volunteers or professionals (sections 4 para. 1 and 8 para. 1). Their role is to deal with, among other things, fires, natural disasters and collapsed buildings, but they may also be required to ensure safety in theatres, at meetings and exhibitions and also at markets (section 2 paras. 1 and 2). All the male residents of the municipality between the ages of 18 and 50 inclusive may be required to serve as firemen, unless they can show that they are unfit to do so on health grounds (section 13 para. 1). If there are insufficient volunteers, the municipalities may call upon these residents to serve (section 13 para. 2), but so far this has never occurred in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nAs the Act does not recognise a right to active service, the municipalities may refuse to accept a volunteer (section 12 para. 3).\n14. The municipalities may adopt decrees making provision for a fire service levy of up to 200 DM; the resulting funds may only be used to meet the needs of the fire brigade (section 43 paras. 1 and 4).\nAnyone who is liable for fire service duty (section 13) and who resides in the municipality at the beginning of the budget year, may be required to pay this levy (section 43 para. 2).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Appeals to the Supreme Court\n16. A decision of the High Court which determines an appeal from the Circuit Court cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court (Eamonn Andrews Productions Limited v. Gaiety Theatre Enterprises [1978] Irish Reports 295). The High Court can, however, ask for the opinion of the Supreme Court on points of law by way of a case stated.\n#### B. Adoption\n17. The adoption of children in Ireland is governed by the Adoption Act 1952. This Act was amended in 1964, 1974 and 1976.\nSection 8 of the 1952 Act established a body to be known as the Adoption Board (An Bord Ucht\u00e1la) to fulfil the functions assigned to it by the Act, its principal function being to make adoption orders on application being made to it by persons desiring to adopt a child.\n18. Arrangements for the adoption of a child under the age of seven years may only be made by a registered adoption society or a Health Board (section 34 of the 1952 Act) and where the mother or guardian of a child proposes to place the child at the disposal of a registered adoption society for adoption the society must, before accepting the child, furnish the mother or father with a statement in writing explaining clearly the effect of an adoption order on the rights of the mother or guardian and the provisions of the Act relating to consent to the making of an adoption order (section 39 of the 1952 Act). When the applicant\u2019s child was placed for adoption there was also a requirement that notice in writing had to be given to the Adoption Board before or within seven days after the reception of the child into the home of the proposed adopters (section 10 of the Adoption Act 1964).\n##### 1. Consent\n19. As regards the requisite consent of the natural parent, section 14 of the 1952 Act provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) An adoption order shall not be made without the consent of every person being the child\u2019s mother or guardian or having charge of or control over the child, unless the Board dispenses with any such consent in accordance with this section.\n(2) The Board may dispense with the consent of any person if the Board is satisfied that that person is incapable by reason of mental infirmity of giving consent or cannot be found.\n...\n(6) A consent may be withdrawn at any time before the making of an adoption order.\u201c\n##### 2. Entitlement to be heard by the Adoption Board\n20. As regards those persons who are entitled to be heard on an application for an adoption order, section 16 of the 1952 Act provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The following persons and no other persons shall be entitled t", "001-57886": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF WYNNE v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge. Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside (see, in this connection, the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n#### B. Release on licence and revocation of a licence\n13. Under section 61 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State may release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment only if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.\n14.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Penal Code\n19. At the relevant time Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code provided:\n\u201cAny person who, publicly or with the intention of disseminating it to a wide circle (\u201cvidere kreds\u201c) of people, makes a statement, or other communication, threatening, insulting or degrading a group of persons on account of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin or belief shall be liable to a fine or to simple detention or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\u201c\nArticle 23, paragraph 1, reads:\n\u201cA provision establishing a criminal offence shall apply to any person who has assisted the commission of the offence by instigation, advice or action. The punishment may be reduced if the person in question only intended to give assistance of minor importance or to strengthen an intent already resolved or if the offence has not been completed or an intended assistance failed.\u201c\n#### B. The 1991 Media Liability Act\n20. The 1991 Media Liability Act (Medieansvarsloven, 1991:348), which entered into force on 1 January 1992, that is after the events giving rise to the present case, lays down rules inter alia on criminal liability in respect of television broadcasts. Section 18 provides:\n\u201cA person making a statement during a non-direct broadcast (forskudt udsendelse) shall be responsible for the statement under general statutory provisions, unless:\n(1) the identity of the person concerned does not appear from the broadcast; or\n(2) [that person] has not consented to the statement being broadcast; or\n(3) [he or she] has been promised that [he or she] may take part [in the broadcast] without [his or her] identity being disclosed and reasonable precautions have been taken to this effect.\nIn the situations described in paragraph 1, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) above, the editor is responsible for the contents of the statements even where a violation of the law has occurred without intent or negligence on his part ...\u201c\nPursuant to section 22:\n\u201cA person who reads out or in any other manner conveys a text or statement, is not responsible for the contents of that text or statement.\u201c\n### III.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n23. Religious freedom is guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law, which reads:\n\u201c(1) Complete freedom of beliefs and conscience is guaranteed to everyone.\n(2) Enjoyment of civil and political rights shall be independent of religious confessions; however, a religious confession may not stand in the way of civic duties.\n(3) No one shall be compelled to take any church-related action or to participate in any church-related celebration, except in pursuance of a power conferred by law on another person to whose authority he is subject.\u201c\n24. Artistic freedom is guaranteed by Article 17a of the Basic Law, which provides:\n\u201cThere shall be freedom of artistic creation and of the publication and teaching of art.\u201c\n25. Section 188 of the Penal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cWhoever, in circumstances where his behaviour is likely to arouse justified indignation, disparages or insults a person who, or an object which, is an object of veneration of a church or religious community established within the country, or a dogma, a lawful custom or a lawful institution of such a church or religious community, shall be liable to a prison sentence of up to six months or a fine of up to 360 daily rates.\u201c\n26. The leading judgment of the Supreme Court on the relationship between the above two provisions was delivered after a plea of nullity for safeguarding the law filed by the Attorney General in a case concerning forfeiture of the film Das Gespenst (\u201cThe Ghost\u201c) by Herbert Achternbusch. Although the plea was dismissed on purely formal grounds without any decision on the merits, it appeared obliquely from the judgment that if a work of art impinges on the freedom of religious worship guaranteed by Article 14 of the Basic Law, that may constitute an abuse of the freedom of artistic expression and therefore be contrary to the law (judgment of 19 December 1985, Medien und Recht (Media and Law) 1986, no. 2, p. 15).\n27. A media offence (Medieninhaltsdelikt) is defined as \u201c[a]n act entailing liability to a judicial penalty, committed through the content of a publication medium, consisting in a communication or performance aimed at a relatively large number of persons\u201c (section 1 para. 12 of the Media Act). Criminal liability for such offences is determined according to the general penal law, in so far as it is not derogated from or added to by special provisions of the Media Act (section 28 of the Media Act).\n28. A specific sanction provided for by the Media Act is forfeiture (Einziehung) of the publication concerned (section 33). Forfeiture may be ordered in addition to any normal sanction under the Penal Code (section 33 para. 1).\nIf prosecution or conviction of any person for a criminal offence is not possible, forfeiture can als", "001-57899": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BONER v.

The relevant Articles of the Constitution provide:\nArticle 15\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to life and to physical and psychological integrity, without being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment under any circumstances. The death penalty shall be abolished except where it is provided for by military criminal law in time of war.\u201c\nArticle 17 para. 1\n\u201cEveryone has the right to liberty and security. ...\u201c\nArticle 18\n\u201c1.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Jurisdiction over drug trafficking\n34. In ordinary cases the investigation of all types of offence falls to the investigating judge (juez de instrucci\u00f3n) in whose district the offence has been committed (section 14.II LECrim). Upon completion of the investigation, the investigating judge may, by means of an order (auto de conclusi\u00f3n del sumario y apertura del juicio oral - section 622 (1) LECrim) commit the accused for trial at the Audiencia Provincial in whose province the offence in question has been committed (section 14.IV LECrim).\n35. Offences concerning drug trafficking that have been committed by \u201corganised gangs or groups and affect various provinces\u201c and any other connected offences come within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Nacional in Madrid (section 65 (1) (e) and in fine of the Judicature Act - Ley Org\u00e1nica del Poder Judicial, \u201cLOPJ\u201c). In such cases investigation falls to the relevant central investigating judge (juez de instrucci\u00f3n central) attached to the Audiencia Nacional, likewise in Madrid (section 88 LOPJ).\n36. Where the same facts are being examined by two courts, the one which considers that it has jurisdiction must ask the other to transfer the file to it (inhibitoria). In such cases the decision to transfer the file can only be taken after the parties have been heard (section 45 LOPJ) and is always final, no appeal being possible (section 49).\n#### B. Criminal Code\n37. Under section 344 of the Criminal Code, \u201canyone who cultivates, manufactures or traffics in toxic or stupefying drugs or psychotropic substances or in any other way promotes, encourages or facilitates the unlawful consumption of them, or possesses them for such purposes\u201c, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment ranging from four months and one day to four years and four months (de arresto mayor en su grado m\u00e1ximo a prisi\u00f3n menor en su grado medio) and to a fine of 500,000 to 50 million pesetas, provided that the damage to health caused by the substances or products involved is not serious. Hashish is regarded as such a substance, as opposed to \u201chard drugs\u201c.\n38. However, under section 344 bis (a) of the Criminal Code, the relevant term of imprisonment is substantially increased, ranging from four years, two months and one day to ten years, where:\n\u201c3. ... the quantity of toxic or stupefying drugs or psychotropic substances ... is particularly large.\n...\n6. ... the offender belongs to an organisation, even a p", "001-57954": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BRYAN v.

Section 58 TCPA allows for planning permission to be granted by a development order.\n16. The Town and Country Planning General Development Order 1988 SI no. 1813 (\u201cTCPGDO\u201c) sets out classes of development for which permission is automatically granted.\nAccording to Article 3 TCPGDO, and Class A of Part 6 of Schedule 2 to the TCPGDO, planning permission is deemed granted for the following developments:\n\u201cA. The carrying out on agricultural land comprised of an agricultural unit of -\n(a) works for the erection, extension or alteration of a building, or\n(b) any excavation or engineering operations, reasonably necessary for the purposes of agriculture within that unit.\u201c\n17.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 September 1995 and 26 January 1996, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Categorisation of detention in the case of murderers\n20. A person who unlawfully kills another with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm is guilty of murder. English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder: \u201cdetention during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure\u201c if the offender is under the age of 18 (section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) - see paragraph 23 below); \u201ccustody for life\u201c if the offender is between 18 and 20 years old (section 8 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982); and \u201clife imprisonment\u201c for an offender aged 21 or over (section 1 (1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965).\nMandatory life sentences are fixed by law in contrast to discretionary life sentences, which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (for example manslaughter, rape, robbery). The principles underlying the passing of a discretionary life sentence are:\n(i) that the offence is grave and\n(ii) that there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside.\nDiscretionary life sentences are indeterminate so that \u201cthe prisoner\u2019s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody only so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large\u201c (R. v. Wilkinson [1983] 5 Criminal Appeal Reports 105, 108).\n#### B. Detention during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure\n21. The notion of detention during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure has its origins in statutory form in an Act of 1800 for \u201cthe safe custody of insane persons charged with offences\u201c (Criminal Lunatics Act), which provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder, treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in \u201cstrict custody until His Majesty\u2019s pleasure shall be known\u201c and described their custody as being \u201cduring His [Majesty\u2019s] pleasure\u201c.\n22. In 1908, detention during His Majesty\u2019s pleasure was introduced in respect of offenders aged between 10 and 16. It was extended to cover those under the age of 18 at the time of conviction (1933) and further extended to cover persons under the age of 18 at the time when the offence was committed (1948).\n23. The provision in force at present is section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (\u201cthe 1933 Act\u201c) which provides:\n\u201cA person convicted of an offence who appears to thecourt to have been under the age of eighteen years at thetime the offence was committed shall not, if he isconvicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment forlife, nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on orrecorded against any such person; but in lieu thereof thecourt shall ... sentence him to be detained during HerMajesty\u2019s pleasure and, if so sent", "001-57983": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF REMLI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. Procedure in the Assize Court is governed by Articles 231 to 380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cCCP\u201c).\nThe Assize Court consists of the court properly speaking - the presiding judge and, normally, two other judges - and the jury, composed of citizens who satisfy the conditions of eligibility laid down by law. It tries mainly serious criminal cases sent to it by the Indictment Division and related or inseparable lesser offences. No reasons are given in its judgments, which are appealable only on points of law.\n#### A. The Assize Court jury\n##### 1. Constitution of the jury\n17. For each case on the Assize Court\u2019s list a jury is empanelled at the beginning of the trial. It contains nine jurors, drawn by lot from a session list. This list contains thirty-five names drawn by lot every three months from an annual list, itself consisting of a variable number of names drawn by lot from preparatory lists that are compiled in each municipality after an initial drawing of names by lot from the electoral register.\nOne or more additional jurors are also drawn by lot and attend the trial in order that they may, if necessary, replace any juror who is unable to sit.\nThe jury is constituted at the point when the names of nine jurors who have not been challenged and the names of the additional jurors have all been drawn by lot.\n##### 2. Challenges\n18. As the names of the jurors are being drawn, the defendant or defendants are entitled to challenge up to five of them and the prosecution up to four. Their grounds for doing so cannot be given.\n19. Article 668 CCP provides:\n\u201cAny judge may be challenged on any of the following grounds:\n1. Where the judge or his spouse is a blood relative or a relative by marriage of one of the parties or of a party\u2019s spouse, up to the degree of second cousin inclusive. The challenge may be made against the judge even in the event of divorce from his spouse or the latter\u2019s death where the spouse was a relative by marriage of one of the parties, up to the second degree inclusive;\n2. Where the judge or his spouse, or a person in respect of whom either acts as guardian (tuteur), supervisory guardian (subrog\u00e9 tuteur) or court-appointed administrator, or a company or association in whose management or supervision either takes part has an interest in the dispute;\n3. Where the judge or his spouse is a blood relative or relative by marriage, to the degree indicated above, of the guardian, supervisory guardian or court-appointed administrator of one of the parties or of a director or manager of a company that is a party to the proceedings;\n##### 4. Where the judge or his spouse is dependent on one of the parties;\n5. Where the judge has dealt with the case as a judge, arbitrator or legal adviser, or where he has given evidence as a witness relating to the facts of the case;\n6. Where there has been litigation between the judge, his spouse or their lineal blood relatives or relatives by marriage and one of the parties, his spouse or his lineal blood relatives or relatives by marriage;\n7. Where the judge or his spouse is litigating in a court of which one of the parties is a judge;\n8. Where the judge or his spouse or their lineal blood relatives or relatives by marriage are in dispute over an issue similar to that between the parties;\n9.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions concerning enforcement of payment of the community charge\n19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c).\nThe relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (\u201capplication for a liability order\u201c) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable.\n...\n(5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid.\u201c\nRegulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (\u201clevying of distress\u201c):\n\u201cWhere a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made.\u201c\nRegulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201c(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\n(2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.\n(3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit -\n(a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or\n(b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of the warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.\n...\n(7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ...\u201c\nThe relevant part of Regulation 42 provides:\n(3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed.\u201c\n20. In Regina v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9 October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that \u201cThe proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax.\u201c However, in Regina v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Freedom of association\n25. Chapter 2, Article 1, of the Instrument of Government provides:\n\u201cAll citizens shall be guaranteed the following in theirrelations with the public authorities:\n1. freedom of expression: the freedom to communicateinformation and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations, or in anyother way;\n...\n5. freedom of association: the freedom to unite with othersfor public or private purposes; ...\u201c\n26. According to Chapter 2, Article 2:\n\u201cAll citizens shall be protected in their relations with the public authorities against all coercion designed to compel themto divulge an opinion in any political, religious, cultural orother similar connection. They shall furthermore be protectedin their relations with the public authorities against allcoercion designed to compel them to participate in any meetingfor the formation of opinion or in any demonstration or otherexpression of opinion or to belong to any politicalassociation, religious congregation or other association foropinions of the nature referred to in the first sentence.\u201c\n27. Chapter 2, Article 12 paras. 1 and 2, reads:\n\u201cThe freedoms and rights referred to in Article 1 paras. 1 to5 ... may be restricted by law to the extent provided for inArticles 13-16 ...\nThe restrictions referred to in the preceding subsection mayonly be imposed to achieve a purpose which is acceptable in ademocratic society. The restriction may never exceed what isnecessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, normay it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the freeformation of opinion as one of the foundations of democracy.No restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of political,religious, cultural or other such opinions.\u201c\n28. Chapter 2, Article 14 para. 2 provides:\n\u201cFreedom of association may only be restricted in respect of organisations whose activities are of a military nature or the like or which involve the persecution of a population group of a particular race, skin colour or ethnic origin.\u201c\n29. Pursuant to Chapter 2, Article 17:\n\u201cAny trade union or employer or association of employers has a right to take industrial action unless otherwise provided by law or by agreement.\u201c\n#### B. Right of association\n30. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work reads:\n\u201cRight of association means the right of employers andemployees to belong to an organisation of employers oremployees, to benefit from their membership as well as to workfor an organisation or for the founding of one.\u201c\n31. Section 8 provides:\n\u201cThe right of association shall not be violated. A violation... will occur, if anyone from the employer\u2019s side or the employee\u2019s side takes any action to the detriment of anybodyon the other side by reason of that person having exercised hisright of association, or if anybody on either side takes anyaction against anybody on the other side with a view toinducing that person not to exercise his right of association.A violation will occur even if the action so taken is designedto fulfil an obligation towards another party.\nAn employers\u2019 or employees\u2019 organisation shall not have to tolerate a violation of its right of association encroaching upon its activities. Where there is both a local and a central organisation, these provisions shall apply to the central organisation.\nIf the right of association is violated by termination of anagreement or another legal measure or by a provision in acollective agreement or other contract, that measure orprovision shall be void.\u201c\n32. According to section 10:\n\u201cAn employees\u2019 organisation shall have the right to negotiatewith an employer regarding any matter relating to therelationship between the employer and any member of theorganisation who is or has been employed by that employer. Anemployer shall have a corresponding right to negotiate with anemployees\u2019 organisation.\nA right of negotiation ... shall also be enjoyed by the employees\u2019 organisation in relation to any organisation towhich an employer belongs, and by the employers\u2019 organisationin relation to the employees\u2019 organisation.\u201c\n#### C. Judicial remedies\n33. Chapter 11, Article 3, of the Instrument of Government provides:\n\u201cLegal disputes between private subjects shall only be settledby a court of law, unless otherwise provided by law ...\u201c\n34. In principle, it is possible for an employer against whom industrial action has been instituted to request a court injunction requiring that the action cease, and to claim damages. Such orders may be made by the relevant court if the industrial action is unlawful or in breach of an existing collective agreement.\nIf the industrial action amounts to a criminal offence, a claim for compensation may be made under Chapter 2, section 4, of the 1972 Compensation Act (skadest\u00e5ndslag 1972:207).\n35. Pursuant to section 1 of the 1988 Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or another public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only judicial instance, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-\u00e0-vis a private individual. The kind of administrative decision covered by the Act is further defined in Chapter 8, Articles 2 and 3, of the Instrument of Government, to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. According to these provisions the Act encompasses measures concerning, inter alia, personal and economic matters arising in relations between private persons and between such persons and the State. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decision which fall outside its scope, none of which are relevant in the instant case.\nIn proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, the Supreme Administrative Court examines whether the contested decision \u201cconflicts with any legal rule\u201c (section 1 of the 1988 Act). If the court finds that the impugned decision is unlawful, it must quash it and, where necessary, refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority (section 5 of the 1988 Act).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n36. In his application to the Commission of 1 July 1989 (no. 15573/89) Mr Gustafsson complained that the lack of State protection against the industrial action taken against his restaurant gave rise to a violation of his right to freedom of association as guaranteed by Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention and also of his right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), in conjunction with Article 17 (art. 17) of the Convention. He further alleged breaches of his rights under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (right to a fair hearing) and Article 13 (art. 13) (right to an effective remedy), complaining that the court remedies to which he could have recourse in order to challenge the industrial action would have been ineffective since such action was lawful under Swedish la", "001-58010": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF SCOTT v.

Spain (1),\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A2, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 September and 30 November 1996,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Constitution\n32. Article 17 of the Constitution guarantees the right to liberty and security of person and sets out the conditions under which a person\u2019s liberty may be restricted. By paragraph 4 of this provision, a habeas corpus procedure shall be provided for in a statute which shall also determine the maximum duration of detention pending trial.\nRegarded as fundamental, Article 17 rights may be the subject of an individual appeal to the Constitutional Court (recurso de amparo).\n#### B. The Criminal Code\n33. Under Article 429 of the Criminal Code in force at the material time, rape was punishable with a term of imprisonment ranging from twelve years and one day to twenty years (reclusi\u00f3n menor).\n34. Under Article 405 of the Criminal Code, killing one\u2019s father or mother (parricidio) was punishable with a term of imprisonment ranging from twenty years and one day to thirty years (reclusi\u00f3n mayor).\n#### C. The Code of Criminal Procedure\n35. Under Article 503 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\u201cThe following conditions must be satisfied before pre-trial detention can be ordered:\n1. It must have been established that an act which may constitute an offence [delito] has been committed.\n2. The offence must be punishable by more than six years\u2019 imprisonment [prisi\u00f3n menor] or, if the term of imprisonment is shorter, the judge must consider it necessary to remand the accused in custody in the light of his criminal record, the circumstances of the offence, the prejudice to public order it has caused or the frequency with which similar acts have been committed ...\n3. There must be sufficient reasons for considering the person to be remanded in custody criminally responsible for the offence.\u201c\n36. By Article 504 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, detention pending trial shall not exceed one year where an offence is punishable with a term of imprisonment ranging from six months and one day to six years (prisi\u00f3n menor) and shall not exceed two years if the applicable sentence is heavier.\nIf, however, the case cannot be tried within that period and there is a risk that the accused may evade justice, Article 504 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that detention pending trial may be prolonged up to two and four years respectively. A reasoned decision (auto) to this effect may only be issued after the competent court has heard the accused and the public prosecutor.\n37. Under Article 528 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, detention pending trial may last for only as long as the original reasons remain valid.\n#### D. Rules on detention pending extradition\n38. Extradition proceedings come within the jurisdiction of the Audiencia Nacional in Madrid irrespective of where the requested person has been detained (section 65 (4) of the Judicature Act - Ley Org\u00e1nica del Poder Judicial). In such cases preliminary proceedings fall to the relevant central investigating judge (juez central de instrucci\u00f3n) attached to the Audiencia Nacional, likewise in Madrid (section 88 of the Judicature Act and section 8 (2) of the Extradition Act 1985).\n39. Under section 8 of the Extradition Act, the detention of a person with a view to his or her extradition may in certain circumstances be sought by a State even before a formal request for extradition is lodged where the requesting State undertakes that the said request will be made within the following forty days. The detainee must be brought before the relevant central investigating judge within twenty-four hours of his or her arrest.\n40. Under section 10 (3) of the Extradition Act, \u201cwhile extradition proceedings are pending, the maximum term of detention of the requested person and his or her rights as a detainee shall be determined, where not laid down in this Act, according to ", "001-58012": "\ufeff\nCOURT (GRAND CHAMBER)\nCASE OF VOGT v.

Petzold, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 February and 2 September 1995,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Basic Law\n25. The following provisions of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) are relevant to the instant case:\nArticle 5\n\u201c(1) Everyone shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his or her opinions in speech, writing and pictures and freely to obtain information from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting on the radio and in films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship.\n(2) These rights shall be subject to the limitations laid down by the provisions of the general laws and by statutory provisions aimed at protecting young people and to the obligation to respect personal honour.\n(3) There shall be freedom of art, science, research and teaching. Freedom of teaching shall not release citizens from their duty of loyalty to the Constitution.\u201c\nArticle 21\n\u201c(1) Political parties shall take part in forming the political opinion of the people. They may be freely set up. Their internal organisation must comply with democratic principles. They must render public account of the origin of their income and their assets and of their expenditure.\n(2) Parties which, through their aims or the conduct of their members, seek to damage or overthrow the free democratic constitutional system or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be held to be anti-constitutional. The Federal Constitutional Court shall determine the question of anti-constitutionality.\n(3) Detailed rules shall be laid down by federal laws.\u201c\nArticle 33\n\u201c...\n(2) All Germans shall have an equal right of admission to the civil service according to their suitability, capabilities and professional qualifications.\n(3) Enjoyment of civil and political rights, admission to the civil service and the rights acquired within the civil service shall not be contingent on religious belief. No one shall be placed at a disadvantage on account of his or her 'adherence or non-adherence' to a religious persuasion [Bekenntnis] or to an 'ideology' [Weltanschauung].\n...\n(5) The provisions governing the civil service must take into account its traditional principles.\u201c\nArticle 48 para. 2\n\u201cNo one shall be prevented from taking office as a member of parliament or from performing the duties attaching thereto. No employment contract may be terminated and no one may be dismissed from employment on this ground.\u201c\n#### B. Legislation governing the civil service\n26. By virtue of section 7 (1) (2) of the Federal Civil Service Act (Bundesbeamtengesetz) and section 4 (1) (2) of the Civil Service (General Principles) Act (Beamtenrechtsrahmengesetz) for the L\u00e4nder, appointments to the civil service are subject to the requirement that the persons concerned \u201csatisfy the authorities that they will at all times uphold the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law\u201c.\n27. According to section 52 (2) of the Federal Civil Service Act and section 35 (1), third sentence, of the Civil Service (General Principles) Act for the L\u00e4nder, \u201ccivil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law and act to uphold it\u201c.\n28. These provisions have been reproduced in the civil service legislation of the L\u00e4nder, and in particular in section 61 (2) of the Lower Saxony Civil Service Act (Nieders\u00e4chsisches Beamtengesetz), which likewise provides that \u201ccivil servants must by their entire conduct bear witness to the free democratic constitutional system within the meaning of the Basic Law and act to uphold it\u201c.\n29. The Lower Saxony Disciplinary Code (Nieders\u00e4chsische Disziplinarordnung) contains the following relevant provisions:\nArticle 2 para. 1\n\u201cUnder this law, measures may be taken against:\n(1) officials who have breached their professional duty while having the status of a civil servant ...\u201c\nArticle 5 para. 1\n\u201cThe disciplinary measures shall be: ... dismissal ...\u201c\nArticle 11 para. 1\n\u201cDismissal shall also entail loss of the right to a salary and of pension rights ...\u201c\n#### C. Decree on employment of extremists in the civil service\n30. On 28 January 1972 the Federal Chancellor and the Prime Ministers of the L\u00e4nder adopted the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service (Ministerpr\u00e4sidentenbeschlu\u00df) (Bulletin of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany no. 15 of 3 February 1972, p. 142), which reiterated civil servants' duty of loyalty to the free democratic constitutional system and provided as follows:\n\u201c... civil servants' membership of parties or organisations that oppose the constitutional system - and any support given to such parties or organisations - shall ... as a general rule lead to a conflict of loyalty. If this results in a breach of duty [Pflichtversto\u00df], it shall be for the employer to decide in each case what measures are to be taken.\u201c\n31. In order to implement the decree, the Government of the Land of Lower Saxony adopted, in particular on 10 July 1972, provisions on \u201cpolitical activity by applicants for civil-service posts and by civil servants directed against the free democratic constitutional system\u201c.\n32. Similar legislation was initially adopted in all the L\u00e4nder. However, from 1979 it was no longer or only partially applied; in some L\u00e4nder the relevant legislation was even repealed.\nIn 1990, as part of their coalition agreement on the formation of a new Government for the Land of Lower Saxony, the Social Democrat and \u201cGreen\u201c parties decided to repeal the decree on employment of extremists in the civil service; the decree was repealed by a ministerial decision of 26 June 1990.\n33. On 28 August 1990 the Land government took a number of measures relating to the treatment of \u201cearlier cases\u201c, that is to say cases of persons who had been excluded from the civil service or refused admission to it on account of", "001-58016": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF FINDLAY v.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 September 1996 and 21 January 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n##### 1. The law in force at the time of Mr Findlay\u2019s court martial\n(a) General\n32. The law and procedures which applied to the applicant\u2019s court martial were contained in the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201c), the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (\u201cthe 1972 Rules\u201c) and the Queen\u2019s Regulations (1975). Since the Commission\u2019s consideration of the case, certain provisions in the 1955 Act have been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201c), which comes into force on 1 April 1997 (see paragraphs 52-57 below).\n33. Many civilian offences are also offences under the 1955 Act (section 70 (1)). Although the final decision on jurisdiction lies with the civilian authorities, army personnel who are accused of such offences are usually tried by the military authorities unless, for example, civilians are involved in some way.\nDepending on their gravity, charges against army law can be tried by district, field or general court martial. A court martial is not a standing court: it comes into existence in order to try a single offence or group of offences.\n34. At the time of the events in question, a general court martial consisted of a president (normally a brigadier or colonel in the army), appointed by name by the convening officer (see paragraphs 36-41 below), and at least four other army officers, either appointed by name by the convening officer or, at the latter\u2019s request, by their commanding officer.\n35. Each member of the court martial had to swear the following oath:\n\u201cI swear by almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to the Army Act 1955, without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose or discover the vote or opinion of the president or any member of this court martial, unless thereunto required in the due course of law.\u201c\n(b) The convening officer\n36. Before the coming into force of the 1996 Act, a convening officer (who had to be a field officer or of corresponding or superior rank, in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court martial. He or she would decide upon the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court martial required, and was responsible for convening the court martial.\n37. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint (see paragraph 15 above). He ensured that a ju", "001-58017": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF FOUCHER v. FRANCE\n(Application no. 22209/93)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n18 March 1997\nIn the case of Foucher v.

Relevant domestic law and practice\n16. The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning institution of proceedings in the police court and the rules of evidence as regards minor offences are as follows:\nArticle 531\n\u201cCases concerning offences within the jurisdiction of the police court shall be brought before it by referral from the investigating authority, by the parties\u2019 voluntary appearance or by the direct committal of the defendant and of the person civilly liable for the offence.\u201c\nArticle 537\n\u201cMinor offences shall be proved by official reports or, where there are no such reports, or in support thereof, by evidence taken from witnesses.\nSave where the law provides otherwise, official reports by law-enforcement officers or their deputies, or by public servants responsible for carrying out certain police duties and authorised by law to draw up reports of minor offences, shall be good evidence in the absence of proof to the contrary.\nProof to the contrary must be established by either written or witness evidence.\u201c\n#### A.

Relevant domestic law and practice on jury trials in the Crown Court\n#### A. The respective roles of the trial judge and jury\n18. The trial judge is the arbiter of issues of law. He must ensure that the trial is properly conducted according to law. He is required at the end of a trial, inter alia, to sum up the evidence, to direct the jury to disregard evidence which is inadmissible, to remind juries of their duties and functions, to explain any law which the jury is required to apply, to direct the jury on the onus and burden of proof and to ask the jury to reach a verdict on the evidence they have heard.\n19. The jury in Crown Court trials consists of twelve members who have taken an oath or affirmed to \u201cfaithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence\u201c. The jury is the arbiter of fact.\n#### B. Jury service\n20. Jury service is regarded as an important civic duty. The Juries Act 1974, as amended, governs qualification for jury service, ineligibility, disqualification, excusal, discharge and other relevant matters.\n21. Every person between 18 and 70 who satisfies the requirements set out in section 1 of the Juries Act 1974 is qualified to serve on a jury and liable to do so if summoned under section 2 of that Act. The electoral register serves as the basis of jury selection.\n22. Random selection of potential jurors is regarded as a key safeguard against corruption or bias in a sworn jury. There are a number of other guarantees, including:\n##### 1. Jury checks\n23. It is lawful for enquiries to be made as to whether potential jurors are disqualified by reason of previous convictions. For this purpose a search may be made of criminal records in order to ascertain whether or not a jury panel includes a disqualified person.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 19 March and 27 May 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. Public telecommunications systems\n##### 1. The offence created by the Interception of Communications Act 1985\n21. The Interception of Communications Act 1985 came into force on 10 April 1986 following the Court\u2019s judgment in Malone v. the United Kingdom (2 August 1984, Series A no. 82). Its objective, as outlined in the Home Office White Paper which preceded it, was to provide a clear statutory framework within which the interception of communications on public systems would be authorised and controlled in a manner commanding public confidence (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom (February 1985) HMSO, Cmnd. 9438).\n22. A \u201cpublic\u201c telecommunications system is defined as a telecommunications system which is run pursuant to a licence granted under the Telecommunications Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201c) and which has been designated as such by the Secretary of State (section 10 (1) of the 1985 Act, by reference to section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act).\n23. By section 1 (1) of the 1985 Act, anyone who intentionally intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a public communications system is guilty of a criminal offence.\n24. Section 1 (2) and (3) provide four circumstances in which a person who intercepts communications in this way will not be guilty of the offence. The only one of these which is relevant to the present case is the interception of a communication pursuant to a warrant issued by the Secretary of State under section 2 of the Act (see paragraph 26 below).\n##### 2. Exclusion of evidence\n25. Section 9 of the 1985 Act provides that no evidence shall be adduced by any party, in any proceedings before a court or tribunal, which tends to suggest either that an offence under section 1 of the 1985 Act has been committed by a public servant or that a warrant has been issued to such a person under section 2 of the 1985 Act.\n##### 3. Warrants\n26. Sections 2 to 6 of the 1985 Act set out detailed rules for the issuing of warrants by the Secretary of State for the interception of communications and the disclosure of intercepted material. Thus, section 2 (2) of the 1985 Act provides:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State shall not issue a warrant ... unless he considers that the warrant is necessary \u2013\n(a) in the interests of national security;\n(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime; or\n(c) for the purposes of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom.\u201c\nWhen considering whether it is necessary to issue a warrant, the Secretary of State must take into account whether the information which it is considered necessary to acquire could reasonably be acquired by other means (section 2 (2) of the 1985 Act).\n27. The warrant must specify the person who is authorised to do the interception, and give particulars of the communications to be intercepted, such as the premises from which the communications will be ", "001-58042": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF KALA\u00c7 v.

Relevant domestic law and practice\n20. Under chapter 22, section 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, a private claim arising from a crime may be lodged against the suspect or a third party in connection with the prosecution of the offence. If it concerns an offence forming the object of public charges, the prosecutor is under an obligation to prepare and present any such claim as the victim may wish to make, provided that it is not seriously inconvenient to do so and that the claim is not manifestly unfounded (section 2). In that event, the trial court will in principle determine the claim for compensation as well as the questions of guilt and sentencing. This is the most frequently used course of action for obtaining compensation for criminal damages.\nA private claim against the suspect may in the alternative be made by way of a civil action under the general rules on tort liability contained in the Tort Liability Act 1972.\nOtherwise, and at the relevant time, compensation could have been sought from the State under the rules of the 1978 Act, which was amended as of 1 July 1994. The 1978 Act was enacted in order to afford crime victims a means of obtaining reparation where the identity of the offender was unknown or where the latter had insufficient means to compensate the victim or where insurance coverage was inadequate.\n21. Section 1 of the 1978 Act read, in so far as is relevant:\n\u201cThis Act regulates compensation to be paid by the State for damage caused by crime. The Act is applicable if the crime has been committed in Sweden ...\u201c\n22. Section 2 of the Ordinance on Damage Caused by Crime (brottsskadef\u00f6rordningen 1978:653) read, at the time in question and in so far as is relevant:\n\u201c...

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 April and 24 September 1996,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n(1) Background to the Limitation Act 1980\n28. Between 1936 and 1974 no fewer than six official bodies reviewed the English law of limitation and reported their findings to Parliament.\n29. The first of these, the Law Revision Committee on Statutes of Limitation, recommended in December 1936 that there should be a fixed six-year period for all actions founded in tort, except in cases where the defendant was a public authority, where the period should be one year only. In both cases time should start to run from the date on which the cause of action accrued.\nThese recommendations were implemented in the Limitation Act 1939.\n30. The first suggestion that there should be a shorter limitation period in personal injury cases was made in July 1946 in the Final Report of the Departmental Committee on Alternative Remedies (\u201cthe Monckton Committee\u201c), which was asked to review the right to damages for personal injury in the light of recently-created social security legislation. The Committee considered that the six-year period was too long for personal injury claims, and recommended that it should be reduced to three years.\n31. In July 1949 the Committee on the Limitation of Actions (\u201cthe Tucker Committee\u201c) recommended that the same limitation period should apply irrespective of whether the defendant was a public authority or a private person, and that a two-year time bar, extendible to six years in exceptional cases, should be imposed in personal injury actions. The limitation period for other actions founded on tort, including inter alia trespass against the person and false imprisonment, should continue to be six years.\nThe Committee\u2019s proposals were followed in the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions) Act 1954, except that, instead of the suggested extendible two-year bar, a fixed three-year period was applied to all \u201cactions for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty ... where the damages claimed ... consist of or include damages in respect of personal injury to any person\u201c. In cases where the plaintiff was under a legal disability, time would only start to run from the date the disability ceased: thus, in the case of a child, from the date he attained his majority (twenty\u2011one at the time the Act was passed, and eighteen after 1 January 1970).\n32. The words \u201cactions for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty\u201c which appeared in the 1954 Act (and which were also used in section 11 (1) of the 1980 Act: see paragraph 35 below) were considered by the Court of Appeal in Letang v. Cooper [1965] 1 Queen\u2019s Bench Reports, p. 232. The plaintiff had been sunbathing in the car park of a hotel when the defendant drove his car over her legs. She did not commence proceedings until over three years after the accident. The Court of Appeal held that the appropriate cause of action lay in negligence and that the claim was therefore time-barred. The three judges expressed the opinion that the words \u201cbreach of duty\u201c in the 1954 Act should be construed as applying to any cause of action giving rise to a claim for damages for personal injury.\n33. In the early 1960s it became apparent that the fixed three-year bar to personal injury actions was causing injustice to some plaintiffs, notably workers who were caused to contract slow-working industrial diseases which it was not possible to detect until after the expiry of the limitation period.\nThe Limitation Act 1963 was therefore passed, to enable the court to extend the time-limit in cases where the plaintiff could not reasonably have been expected to discover earlier the existence or cause of his injury. However, the provisions enacted proved to be over-complicated and difficult to operate.\n34. In May 1974 the Interim Report of the Law Reform Committee on Limitation of Actions in Personal Injury Claims was published. It considered the purpose of having a limitation period, and observed:\n\u201cIn the first place, it is intended to protect defendants from being vexed by stale claims relating to long-past incidents about which their records may no longer be in existence and as to which their witnesses, even if they are still available, may well have no accurate recollection. Secondly, we apprehend that the law of limitation is designed to encourage plaintiffs not to go to sleep on their rights, but to institute proceedings", "001-58083": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF VACHER v.

Relevant domestic law\n13. The main provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure referred to in the present case are the following:\nArticle 568\n\u201cThe prosecuting authority and all the parties shall have five clear days in which to appeal to the Court of Cassation after delivery of the judgment appealed against.\n...\u201c\nArticle 576\n\u201cNotice of appeal shall be given to the registrar of the court which delivered the judgment appealed against.\nIt must be signed by the registrar and by the appellant himself or by a lawyer [avou\u00e9] at the court which gave judgment, or by a specially authorised person ...\nThe appeal shall be recorded in a special public register and any person shall be entitled to obtain a copy of it.\u201c\nArticle 584\n\u201cAn appellant on points of law may lodge a pleading bearing his signature and containing the grounds of his appeal with the registry of the court against whose judgment he is appealing either when he gives notice of appeal or within the following ten days. The registrar shall issue him with a receipt.\u201c\nArticle 585\n\u201cAfter expiry of that time-limit, a convicted appellant may send his pleading directly to the Court of Cassation; the other parties may not avail themselves of this provision without retaining a member of the Court of Cassation Bar.\n...\u201c\nLaw no. 93-1013 of 24 August 1993, which came into force on 2 September 1993, inserted Article 585-1, which provides:\n\u201cSave where the President of the Criminal Division decides otherwise, a convicted appellant shall lodge his pleading with the registry of the Court of Cassation no later than one month from the date of the notice of appeal.\u201c\nIn his report of 23 June 1993 presented to the National Assembly on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Law, Legislation and the General Administration of the Republic, Mr Jean Tib\u00e9ri justified the insertion of the new Article 585-1 as follows:\n\u201cThe new Article 585-1 is intended to resolve a difficulty which has appeared in recent years. The Court of Cassation frequently dismisses appeals on points of law because no pleadings have been filed in support of them. As the Law does not lay down a time-limit for filing a pleading, a convicted appellant\u2019s pleading may reach the court a few days after his appeal has been dismissed. Indeed, applications are pending before the European Commission of Human Rights on this question. So as to avoid such situations recurring, the new Article 585-1 provides that convicted appellants shall have a period of one month, which may be extended by the President of the Criminal Division, in which ", "001-58086": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ANNE-MARIE ANDERSSON c.

Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. Parliamentary elections\n16. The date of a general election is chosen by the incumbent Prime Minister and is normally announced between four and six weeks before polling day.\n17. For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies. Each constituency is represented by a single member of Parliament, the person who received the greatest number of votes in his or her constituency. Most candidates are selected by the main, national political parties, although some stand as independent. A candidate\u2019s nomination for election must be signed by ten people registered to vote in the constituency. Each candidate must deposit GBP 500 with the constituency returning officer. If he or she does not receive at least 5% of the votes validly cast, this deposit will be forfeited.\n#### B. Control of election expenditure\n18. Parliamentary candidates in the United Kingdom receive no State funding for their campaigns. To safeguard the position of candidates without access to substantial resources, the amount of expenses which may be incurred by a candidate before, during or after an electoral campaign is controlled by statute (1983 Act, section 76).

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 April and 25 June 1998,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. Alleged violation of Article 8 of the Convention\n40. The applicants complained that the failure of the respondent State to recognise in law that they were of the female sex constituted an interference with their rights to respect for their private lives guaranteed under Article 8 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n41. The Commission accepted the applicants\u2019 submissions. The Government contended that there had been no violation of Article 8 in the circumstances of the case.\n##### 1. Arguments of those appearing before the Court\n(a) The applicants\n42. The applicants stated that under English law they continue to be regarded as being of the male sex and to suffer prejudice on that account. The failure to give legal recognition to their new gender has serious consequences for the way in which they conducted their lives, compelling them to identify themselves frequently in public contexts in a gender which they had renounced. This was a matter of profound hurt and distress and an affront to their dignity. Miss Sheffield\u2019s experiences (see paragraphs 16\u201320 above) provided a convincing account of the extreme disadvantages which beset post-operative transsexuals and of how the current legal situation operated to the detriment of their privacy and even exposed them to the risk of penalties for the offence of perjury. For her part, Miss Horsham claimed that she had had to abandon her residence in the United Kingdom in order to avoid the difficulties which she encountered there as a transsexual.\n43. They contended that the law of the respondent State continued to be based on a restrictive and purely biological approach to the determination of an individual\u2019s gender (see paragraphs 27 and 29 above). In their view, the\nconclusive nature of that approach should now be reviewed in light of recent medical research findings which demonstrated convincingly that the sex of a person\u2019s brain is also to be considered one of the decisive indices of his or her gender. According to Professor L.J.G. Gooren, a distinguished and recognised authority on this subject, the brain\u2019s ability to differentiate between the male and female sex occurs when an individual is between 3 and 4 years old. A problem arises if the brain differentiates sex in a manner which is contradictory to the nature of the external genitalia. This dysfunction explains the feelings which transsexuals like the applicants have about their bodies.\n44. The continued insistence in English law on the use of purely biological criteria for the determination of gender meant that they were unable to have the register of births amended to record their post-operative gender. The applicants challenged the official view that it was impossible to amend or update the facts contained in the register save for cases of clerical or factual error. They pointed to instances where the register had been amended to take account of a person\u2019s change of sex and reasoned that if it were possible to update the register in cases of adoption it should also be feasible to do so in respect of gender reassignment.\n45. The applicants recalled that the Court in its Rees v. the United Kingdom judgment of 17 October 1986 (Series A no. 106, pp. 18\u201319, \u00a7 47) had stated that the respondent State should keep the need for appropriate legal measures in the area of transsexualism under review having regard in particular to scientific and societal developments. The Court reiterated that view in its Cossey v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 September 1990 (Series A no. 184, p. 17, \u00a7 41). Notwithstanding new medical findings on the cause of transsexualism (see paragraph 43 above) and the increased legal recognition of a transsexual\u2019s post-operative gender at the level of the European Union and in the member States of the Council of Europe (see paragraphs 33\u201335 above), the respondent State has still not reviewed its domestic law in this area.\n(b) The Government\n46. The Government replied that Article 8 of the Convention does not require a Contracting State to recognise generally for legal purposes the new sexual identity of an individual who has undergone gender reassignment surgery. With reference to the above-mentioned Rees and Cossey judgments, they pleaded that a Contracting State properly enjoys a wide margin of appreciation in respect of its positive obligations under Article 8, especially so in the area of transsexualism where there is no sufficiently broad consensus within the member States on how to address the complexity of the legal, ethical, scientific and social issues which arise.\nThey argued that Professor Gooren\u2019s research findings on the notion of a person\u2019s psychological sex (see paragraph 43 above) cannot be considered conclusive of the issue and required further verification (see, for example, S.M. Breedlove\u2019s article in Nature, vol. 378, p. 15, 2 November 1995); nor was the applicants\u2019 reliance on the European Court of Justice\u2019s ruling in P. v. S. and Cornwall County Council of support to their case that a European-wide consensus existed on the need to give legal recognition to the situation of transsexuals. That case was not concerned with the legal status of transsexuals. Moreover, much of the comparative material submitted by Liberty had already been considered by the Court at the time of its judgment in the Rees case.\n47. The Government further submitted that the applicants had not adduced any evidence of having suffered any substantial practical detriment on a day-to-day basis which would suggest that the autho", "001-58220": "\ufeff\nCASE OF COUEZ v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n23. The Principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional, hereditary monarchy on a democratic and parliamentary basis; the power of the State is inherent in and emanates from the Prince and the people and shall be exercised by both of them in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution (Article 2 of the Constitution of 24 October 1921).\n24. Chapter II of the Constitution is entitled \u201cThe Prince\u201d. In its Article 7, it stipulates that the Prince is the head of the State and exercises his sovereign authority in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution and of the other laws; and that his person is sacred and inviolable. Further competences are laid down in Articles 8 to 13. According to Article 11, the Prince appoints the State officials, in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution (see Article 79 concerning the head of the government, the government councillors and their substitutes; Article 97 concerning the president of the Administrative Court and his deputy; Article 99, in conjunction with the Court Organisation Act, concerning the first-instance judges; Article 102 \u00a7 3 concerning the members of the High Court (Obergericht) and the Supreme Court of Justice (Oberster Gerichtshof)). By letter of 28 April 1997, the Prince informed the Liechtenstein government that he instructed it to proceed, within its competence, with the appointment in 1997 of State officials who, pursuant to Article 11 of the Constitution, were to be appointed by the Prince.\n25. Chapter IV of the Constitution contains the general rights and obligations of citizens of the Principality. Article 31 stipulates the equality of all citizens before the law, and also provides that the public offices are equally open to them, subject to observance of the legal regulations.\n26. According to Article 97 of the Constitution, all decisions or orders by the government are subject to appeal before the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court consists of a president trained in the law and of his deputy, who are appointed by the Prince on the proposal of the Diet, and of four appeal judges and their substitutes, who are elected by the Diet. The president and his deputy must be Liechtenstein nationals. Their term of office coincides with that of the Diet, and ends at such time as they are replaced.\n27. According to Article 104 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court is, inter alia, competent to protect rights accorded by the Constitution. Section 23 of the Constitutional Court Act (Staatsgerichtshofgesetz) provides that decisions of a court or of an administrative authority may be challenged before the Constitutional Court, by alleging that there has been an infringement of constitutional rights or of rights guaranteed under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n28. Pursuant to Article 105 of the Constitution, in conjunction with section 4 of the Constitutional Court Act, the judges of the Constitutional Court are elected by the Diet; the election of the president and the deputy president are subject to confirmation by the Prince.\n29. Article 112 of the Constitution reads as follows:\n\u201cIf doubts arise as to the interpretation of specific provisions of the Constitution and cannot be dispelled on the basis of an agreement between the Government and the Diet, the Constitutional Court is called upon to decide on the matter.\u201d\n\u201cWenn \u00fcber die Auslegung einzelner Bestimmungen der Verfassung Zweifel entstehen und nicht durch \u00dcbereinkunft zwischen der Regierung und dem Landtage beseitigt werden k\u00f6nnen, so hat hier\u00fcber der Staatsgerichtshof zu entscheiden.\u201d\n30. In 1991 the Liechtenstein government introduced a bill in Parliament with the object of amending the Constitutional Court Act of 1925.

Before the Commission the applicants made a complaint under Article 11 of the Convention (see paragraph 20 above).\n24. This complaint was not pursued before the Court, which sees no reason to consider it of its own motion (see, for example, the Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, p. 680, \u00a7 52).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF aRTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicants alleged a violation of Article 10 of the Convention. In particular, they claimed that the finding that they had behaved in a manner contra bonos mores and the subsequent binding-over order constituted an interference with their rights under Article 10 which was not \u201cprescribed by law\u201d within the meaning of that provision.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 May 1999 and on 24 August 1999,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. Decriminalisation of homosexual acts\n37. By virtue of section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, homosexual acts in private between two consenting adults (at the time meaning 21 years or over) ceased to be criminal offences. However, such acts continued to constitute offences under the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (Section 1(5) of the 1967 Act). Section 1(5) of the 1967 Act was repealed by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (which Act also reduced the age of consent to 18 years). However, section 146(4) of the 1994 Act provided that nothing in that section prevented a homosexual act (with or without other acts or circumstances) from constituting a ground for discharging a member of the armed forces.\n#### B. R. v. Secretary of State for Defence, ex parte Perkins, judgments of 13 March 1997 and 13 July 1998, and related cases\n38. On 30 April 1996 the ECJ decided that transsexuals were protected from discrimination on grounds of their transsexuality under European Community law (P. v. S. and Cornwall County Council [1996] Industrial Relations Law Reports 347).\n39. On 13 March 1997 the High Court referred to the ECJ pursuant to Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome the question of the applicability of the Equal Treatment Directive to differences of treatment based on sexual orientation (R. v. Secretary of State for Defence, ex parte Perkins, 13 March 1997). Mr Perkins had been discharged from the Royal Navy on grounds of his homosexuality.\n40. On 17 February 1998 the ECJ found that the Equal Pay Directive 75/117/EEC did not apply to discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation (Grant v. South West Trains Ltd [1998] Industrial Cases Reports 449).\n41. Consequently, on 2 March 1998 the ECJ enquired of the High Court in the Perkins\u2019 case whether it wished to maintain the Article 177 reference. After a hearing between the parties, the High Court decided to withdraw the question from the ECJ (R. v. Secretary of State for Defence, ex parte Perkins, 13 July 1998). Leave to appeal was refused.\n#### C. The Ministry of Defence policy on homosexual personnel in the armed forces\n42. As a consequence of the changes made by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, updated Armed Forces\u2019 Policy and Guidelines on Homosexuality (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d) were distributed to the respective service directorates of personnel in December 1994. The Guidelines provided, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201cHomosexuality, whether male or female, is considered incompatible with service in the armed forces. This is not only because of the close physical conditions in which personnel often have to live and work, but also because homosexual behaviour can cause offence, polarise relationships, induce ill-discipline and, as a consequence, damage morale and unit effectiveness. If individuals admit to being homosexual whilst serving and their Commanding Officer judges that this admission is well-founded they will be required to leave the services. ...\nThe armed forces\u2019 policy on homosexuality is made clear to all those considering enlistment. If a potential recruit admits to being homosexual, he/she will not be enlisted. Even if a potential recruit admits to being homosexual but states that he/she does not at present nor in the future intend to engage in homosexual activity, he/she will not be enlisted. ...\nIn dealing with cases of suspected homosexuality, a Commanding Officer must make a balanced judgment taking into account all the relevant factors. ... In most circumstances, however, the interests of the individual and the armed forces will be best served by formal investigation of the allegations or suspicion. Depending on the circumstances, the Commanding Officer will either conduct an internal inquiry, using his own staff, or he will seek assistance from the Service Police. When conducting an internal inquiry he will normally discuss the matter with his welfare support staff. Homosexuality is not a medical matter, but there may be circumstances in which the Commanding Officer should seek the advice of the Unit Medical Officer on the individual concerned and may then, if the individual agrees, refer him/her to the Unit Medical Officer. ...\nA written warning in respect of an individual\u2019s conduct or behaviour may be given in circumstances where there is some evidence of homosexuality but insufficient ... to apply for administrative discharge ... . If the Commanding Officer is satisfied on a high standard of proof of an individual\u2019s homosexuality, administrative action to terminate service ... is to be initiated, ... .\u201c\nOne of the purposes of the Guidelines was the reduction of the involvement of the service police whose investigatory methods, based on criminal procedures, had been strongly resented and widely publicised in the past (confirmed at paragraph 9 of the Homosexual Policy Assessment Team\u2019s report of February 1996 which is summarised at paragraphs 44-55 below. However, paragraph 100 of this report indicated that investigation into homosexuality is part of \u201cnormal service police duties\u201d. )\n43. The affidavit of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Frederick Willis KCB, CBE, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, Ministry of Defence dated 4 September 1996, which was submitted to the High Court in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for Defence, ex parte Perkins (13 July1998), read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cThe policy of the Ministry of Defence is that the special nature of homosexual life precludes the acceptance of homosexuals and homosexuality in the armed forces. The primary concern of the armed forces is the maintenance of an operationally effective and efficient force and the consequent need for strict maintenance of discipline. [The Ministry of Defence] believes that the presence of homosexual personnel has the potential to undermine this.\nThe conditions of military life, both on operations and within the service environment, are very different from those experienced in civilian life. \u2026 The [Ministry of Defence] believes that these conditions, and the need for absolute trust and confidence between personnel of all ranks, must dictate its policy towards homosexuality in the armed forces. It is not a question of a moral judgement, nor is there any suggestion that homosexuals are any less courageous than heterosexual personnel; the policy derives from a practical assessment of the implications of homosexuality for fighting power.\u201d\n#### D. The report of the Homosexuality Policy Assessment Team \u2013 February 1996\n##### 1. General\n44. Following the decision in the case of R. v. Ministry of Defence, ex parte Smith and Others 2 Weekly Law Reports 305, the Homosexuality Policy Assessment Team (\u201cHPAT\u201d) was established by the Ministry of Defence in order to undertake an internal assessment of the armed forces\u2019 policy on homosexuality. The HPAT was composed of Ministry of Defence civil servants and representatives of the three services. The HPAT\u2019s assessment was to form the basis of the Ministry\u2019s evidence to the next Parliamentary Select Committee (as confirmed in the affidavit of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Frederick Willis referred to at paragraph 43 above). The HPAT was to consult the Ministry of Defence, the armed forces\u2019 personnel of all ranks, service and civilian staff responsible for carrying out the policy together with members of the legal adviser\u2019s staff. It was also to examine the policies of other nation", "001-58409": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MOORE AND GORDON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n#### A. The Civil Code\n17. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code, introduced by Law no. 72-3 of 3 January 1972, provide:\nArticle 745\n\u201cChildren or their issue shall inherit from their father and mother, grandfathers, grandmothers or other ancestors, irrespective of sex or primogeniture, and even if they are born of different marriages.\nThe estate shall devolve upon them in equal portions and per capita if they are all first degree issue and heirs in their own right; they shall inherit per stirpes if all or some of them inherit through their ascendants.\u201d\nArticle 757\n\u201cChildren born out of wedlock shall, in general, inherit from their father and mother or other ancestors, as well as from their brothers and sisters or other collateral relatives, on the same terms as legitimate children.\u201d\nArticle 760\n\u201cChildren born out of wedlock whose father or mother was, at the time of their conception, bound by a marriage of which legitimate children were born are entitled to inherit from that parent in competition with the legitimate children; however, they shall each receive only half of the share to which they would have been entitled if all the children of the deceased, including themselves, had been legitimate.\nThe children born of the marriage injured by the adultery shall inherit in addition the fraction by which the adulterine child\u2019s share of the estate is thus reduced; it shall be divided between them in proportion to their share in the estate.\u201d\n#### B. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\n18. The relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which came into force on 2 September 1990, read as follows:\nArticle 2\n\u201c1. States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the present Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child\u2019s or his or her parent\u2019s or legal guardian\u2019s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The prosecution's duty of disclosure\n19. At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence.\n#### B. Limitations to the duty of disclosure on grounds of public interest\n##### 1. The Attorney General's Guidelines (1981)\n20. In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Cr. App. R. 302 (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d)). The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution's power to withhold \u201cunused material\u201d. Under paragraph 1, \u201cunused material\u201d was defined as:\n\u201c(i) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence; (ii) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and (if not in the bundle) any documents referred to therein; (iii) the unedited version(s) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles.\u201d\nUnder paragraph 2, any item falling within this definition was to be made available to the defence if \u201c... it has some bearing on the offence(s) charged and the surrounding circumstances of the case\u201d.\n21. According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was \u201csensitive\u201d material which, because of its sensitivity,\nit would not be in the public interest to disclose. \u201cSensitive material\u201d was defined as follows:\n\u201c... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier - e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.\u201d\nAccording to paragraph 8, \u201cin deciding whether or not statements containing sensitive material should be disclosed, a balance should be struck between the degree of sensitivity and the extent to which the information might assist the defence\u201d. The decision as to whether or not the balance in a particular case required disclosure of sensitive material was one for the prosecution, although any doubt should be resolved in favour of disclosure. If either before or during the trial it became apparent that a duty to disclose had arisen, but that disclosure would not be in the public interest because of the sensitivity of the material, the prosecution would have to be abandoned.\n##### 2. R. v Ward (1992)\n22. Since 1992 the Guidelines have been superseded by the common law, notably by a number of decisions of the Court of Appeal.\nIn R. v. Ward ([1993] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 619) the Court of Appeal dealt with the duties of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity. It stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to be the judge of where the proper balance lay in a particular case, because:\n\u201c... [When] the prosecution acted as judge in their own cause on the issue of public interest immunity in this case they committed a significant number of errors which affected the fairness of the proceedings. Policy considerations therefore powerfully\nreinforce the view that it would be wrong to allow the prosecution to withhold material documents without giving any notice of that fact to the defence. If, in a wholly exceptional case, the prosecution are not prepared to have the issue of public interest immunity determined by a court, the result must", "001-58496": "\ufeff\nCASE OF ROWE AND DAVIS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Popular initiatives\n20. Article 139 of the Federal Constitution of 18 April 1999 (formerly Articles 118, 121 to 123 of the Federal Constitution of 29 May 1874) provides that 100,000 citizens may seek, by way of a constitutional or popular initiative, an amendment to the Constitution on any topic. Popular initiatives do not originate from Parliament or the government, but from the citizens themselves.\n21. On 18 February 1979 the popular initiative on the \u201cSafeguard of the People's Rights and the Safety of the Construction and Operation of Nuclear Installations\u201d was rejected by a majority of the people and the cantons. In 1981 the popular initiative \u201cFor the Interruption of the Nuclear Power Programme\u201d failed, because the necessary 100,000 signatures could not be collected within eighteen months. On 23 September 1984 the people and the cantons rejected the initiative \u201cFor a Future without Further Nuclear Power Plants\u201d. On 23 September 1990 the popular initiative \u201cStop the Construction of Nuclear Power Plants (Moratorium)\u201d was adopted, while on the same date the initiative \u201cFor the Progressive Abandonment of Nuclear Energy\u201d was rejected. Two further popular initiatives \u201cMoratorium-Plus \u2013 for the Extension of the Moratorium concerning the Construction of Nuclear Power Plants and the Limitation of the Nuclear Risk\u201d and \u201cGet out of Nuclear Power \u2013 For a Change in the Field of Energy and for the Progressive Closing-Down of Nuclear Power Plants (Get out of Nuclear Power)\u201d, filed on 28 September 1999, are still pending.\n#### B. The Federal Act on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy\n22. Under section 4(1)(a) of the Federal Act of 23 December 1959 on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy (\u201cthe Nuclear Energy Act\u201d), a licence from the Confederation is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose, nature or scale of such installations.\nSection 5(1) provides that a licence must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others or important rights.\nSection 6 provides that the Federal Council or a body designated by it decides licence applications. No appeal lies against its decisions.\nSection 8 stipulates that nuclear installations and every form of ownership of radioactive nuclear fuels and residues shall be placed under federal supervision; the Federal Council and the body designated by it shall have the right in executing their supervisory function to issue instructions at any time if that becomes necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others and important rights; they are also entitled to supervise compliance with these instructions.\n23. Under the Federal Court's case-law, the safety of nuclear power plants can be considered by the Confederation only in the context of its licensing procedures (Judgments of the Federal Court (ATF), vol. 119 Ia, p. 402).\n#### C. Federal order concerning the Nuclear Energy Act\n24. In addition to the previously required authorisations, Article 1 of the federal order of 6 October 1978 concerning the Nuclear Energy Act requires a general licence of the Federal Council for all nuclear installations as a prerequisite for granting construction and operating licences. The Federal Council has the exclusive competence to grant licences. The procedure for the granting of the general licence requires, according to Article 5, publication of the application and, according to Article 7, publication of the comments and expert opinions on the application.\nThe licensing decision is based on the conclusions of the safety authorities reached at the end of the detailed review and assessment of the safety analysis report, of the probabilistic safety analysis, and of additional documents that may be requested from the applicant (see paragraphs 25 and 26 below).\n#### D. Federal ordinance concerning the supervision of nuclear installations\n25. The ordinance of 14 March 1983, which deals with the regulation of nuclear installations, entrusts the HSK with the regulatory role.\nThe ordinance formally establishes the HSK as the competent authority for supervising nuclear installations as long as they exist, including inspections of nuclear power plants. The HSK supervises the operators, and assesses the nuclear safety and radiation protection of nuclear power plants. It pr", "001-58590": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KURT NIELSEN v.

At the relevant time the provisions governing the prosecution and pre-trial detention of accused members of the army were contained in the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d), in the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (\u201cthe 1972 Rules\u201d) and in the Queen's Regulations for the Army 1975 (\u201cthe Queen's Regulations\u201d).\nSubsequent to the relevant facts of the present case, the law has been amended by, inter alia, the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57) and by the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997.\n17.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\na. Preventive measures in criminal proceedings\n18. At the relevant time, the authorities competent to decide on detention on remand were provided for in Articles 210 and 212 of the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969, which read as follows:\nArticle 210:\n\u201c1. Preventive measures [i.e. detention on remand, bail and police supervision] shall be imposed by the court; before a bill of indictment is lodged with the court, they shall be ordered by the prosecutor (...).\u201c\nArticle 212:\n\u201c1. A decision concerning preventive measures may be appealed [to a higher court] ....\n2. A prosecutor's order on detention on remand may be appealed to the court competent to deal with the merits of the case....\u201c\n19. These provisions were amended on 29 June 1995 by the Law of 29 June 1995 on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes, which entered into force on 4 August 1996. Pursuant to this amendment, detention on remand could be imposed only by a court order.\n20. A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted by the Sejm (Parliament) on 6 June 1997. Its Article 250, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand shall be imposed by a court order.\n2. In the investigative stage of proceedings, detention on remand shall be imposed, on a prosecutor's request, by a district court in the jurisdiction of which investigations are being conducted. After a bill of indictment is lodged with a court, a decision to impose detention on remand shall be given by a court competent to deal with the merits of the case.\n3. The prosecutor, when submitting to a court a request referred to in \u00a7 2, shall at the same time order that the suspect be brought before a court.\u201c\n21. At the relevant time the presence of the parties at court sessions other than hearings was regulated in Articles 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1969, which, insofar as relevant, provided:\nArticle 87:\n\u201cThe Court pronounces its decisions at a hearing if the law provides for it; and otherwise, at a court session held in camera. ...\u201c\nArticle 88:\n\u201cA court session in camera may be attended by a prosecutor (...); other parties may attend if the law provides for it.\u201c\n22. Pursuant to Article 249 of the new Code of Criminal Procedure, before deciding on the application of the preventive measures, the court shall hear the person charged with offence. The lawyer of the detainee should be allowed to attend in the court session, if he or she is present. It is not mandatory to inform the lawyer of the date and time of the court session, unless the suspect so requests and if it will not hinder the proceedings.\n23. The court shall inform the lawyer of a detained person of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand, or an appeal against a decision to impose or to prolong detention on remand is to be considered.\nb. Position of prosecutors under Polish law\n24. At the material time the relations between the organs of the Polish State were set out in interim legislation, i.e. the Constitutional Act of 17 October 1992 (Ma\u0142a Konstytucja). Article 1 of the Act laid down the principle of the separation of powers in the following terms:\n\u201cThe legislative power of the State shall be vested in the Sejm and the Senate of the Republic of Poland; the executive power shall be vested in the President of Poland and the Council of Ministers; and judicial power shall be vested in the independent courts.\u201c\n25. Under Article 56 of the Act, the Council of Ministers (Rada Ministr\u00f3w) shall be composed of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers.\n26. In pursuance of Article 1 of the Act of 20 June 1985 (Ustawa o s\u0105dach powszechnych), the courts are entrusted with administration of justice in the Republic of Poland.

English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder in respect of offenders under the age of 18 known as detention during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure (section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933); in respect of offenders between the age of 18 and 20 years, custody for life (section 8(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982), and in respect of offenders aged 21 and over, life imprisonment (section 1(1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1967).\n13. Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law, in contrast to discretionary life sentences which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (e.g. manslaughter, rape or robbery). The principles underlying the imposition of a discretionary life sentence are:\ni. that the offence is grave, and\nii. that there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when the danger will subside.\n14.

Section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides that:\n\u201c(1) Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused \u2013\n(a) at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed, failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings; or\n...\nbeing a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, subsection (2) below applies.\n(2) Where this subsection applies\n...\n(c) the court, in determining whether there is a case to answer; and\n(d) the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged,\nmay draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper.\n(3) Subject to any directions by the court, evidence tending to establish the failure may be given before or after evidence tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention.\n...\u201d\nSection 35(2) and (3) provides:\n\u201c(2) Where this subsection applies, the court shall, at the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution, satisfy itself (in the case of proceedings on indictment, in the presence of the jury) that the accused is aware that the stage has been reached at which evidence can be given for the defence and that he can, if he wishes, give evidence and that, if he chooses not to give evidence, or having been sworn, without good cause refuses to answer any question, it will be permissible for the court or jury to draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence or his refusal, without good cause, to answer any question.\n(3) Where this subsection applies, the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences as appear proper from the failure of the accused to give evidence or his refusal, without good cause, to answer any question.\u201d\nSection 38(3) adds that:\n\u201cA person shall not ... be convicted of an offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure or refusal as is mentioned in section 34(2) ...\u201d\n31. Guidance as to the direction which the judge should give the jury in respect of section 35 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 are provided by the Judicial Studies Board specimen directions and by the dicta of Lord Taylor CJ in R. v. Cowan ([1996] 1 Criminal Appeal Reports 1). The relevance of these dicta to directions under section 34 of the same Act was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in the instant case.\n32. The Judicial Studies Board guideline direction at the time of the Court of Appeal's consideration of the applicant's appeal provided that:\n\u201cIf he failed to mention ... when he was questioned, decide whether in the circumstances which existed at the time, it was a fact which he could reasonably have been expected then to mention.\nThe law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to mention it at that time. You do not have to hold it against him. It is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so. Failure to mention such a fact at that time cannot, on its own, prove guilt, but depending on the circumstances, you may hold that failure against him when deciding whether he is guilty, that is, take it into account as some additional support for the prosecution's case. It is for you to decide whether it is fair to do so.\u201d\n33. The dicta of Lord Taylor CJ are as follows:\n\u201cWe consider that the specimen direction is in general terms a sound guide.

The applicant submitted that his case was different from Gregory v. the United Kingdom in which the Court did not find a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I). The other jurors knew who the complaining juror was. Obviously the latter was forced to withdraw his complaint. The disclosure of his identity must have prejudiced his position and inhibited him in the further discussion of the case. Moreover, one juror admitted to making racist remarks. The other juror about whom the complaint had been made remained silent. These developments should have alerted the judge to the fact that there was something fundamentally wrong with the jury and the judge should have discharged them. The judge did not react in this manner and, as a result, there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The fact that the same jury acquitted G.C., who was also Asian, was irrelevant because the case against him was completely different. There was practically no evidence against him.\n20. The Government submitted that the facts of the applicant's case were very similar to those in the Gregory case cited above. In both cases the judge received a note alleging racial bias. The judge addressed the jury in accordance with domestic case-law and practice. Both applicants' appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal, which applied principles similar to those under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nInterception of correspondence\n24. Section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Where a bankruptcy order has been made, the court may from time to time, on the application of the official receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, order the Post Office to re-direct and send or deliver to the official receiver or trustee or otherwise any postal packet (within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1953) which would otherwise be sent or delivered by them to the bankrupt at such place or places as may be specified in the order.\n2. An order under this section has effect for such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified in the order.\u201d\n25. Trustees in Bankruptcy have other statutory powers, which are more stringent than the power to apply for a re-direction order but which may nonetheless need to be used, in appropriate cases, if Trustees are properly to investigate the bankrupt\u2019s affairs for the ultimate benefit of his creditors. In particular, under section 365 of the Insolvency Act 1986 a Trustee may obtain a warrant authorising him to seize property, books and/or records falling into the debtor\u2019s estate. Furthermore, section 366 of the Act allows the court (on application by a Trustee) to summon a variety of persons before it to give an affidavit and/or produce documents.\n26.

Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations (the Home Office Guidelines of 1984) provide that only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines are available in the library of the House of Commons and are disclosed by the Home Office on application.\n17. In each case, the authorising officer should satisfy himself that the following criteria are met: (a) the investigation concerns serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, or must from the nature of things, be unlikely to succeed if tried; (c) there must be good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism; (d) the use of equipment must be operationally feasible. The authorising officer should also satisfy himself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.\n18. The Guidelines also state that there may be circumstances in which material so obtained could appropriately be used in evidence at subsequent court proceedings.\n#### B. The Police Complaints Authority\n19. The Police Complaints Authority was created by section 89 of PACE. It is an independent body empowered to receive complaints as to the conduct of police officers. It has powers to refer charges of criminal offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions and itself to bring disciplinary charges.\n#### C. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984\n20.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n22. Article 27 of the Ordinance of 2 November 1945 as amended, concerning the conditions of entry and residence of aliens in France reads as follows:\n\u201cAny alien who has evaded or attempted to evade the execution of an order refusing him leave to enter France, a deportation order or a removal order or who, having been deported or being subject to an exclusion order, re-enters the national territory without authorisation shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of from six months to three years.\nThe same penalty may be imposed on any alien who fails to present to the relevant administrative authority travel documents enabling any of the measures mentioned in the first sub-paragraph to be executed or who does not have such documents and fails to supply the information necessary to allow such execution.\nThe court may in addition issue an order banning a person so convicted from re-entering the territory for a period not exceeding ten years.\nA ban on re-entering the territory automatically entails the convicted person\u2019s removal from French territory, on completion of his prison sentence where appropriate.\u201d\n23. Article 702-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:\n\u201cAny person subject to a ban, forfeiture or incapacity or any measure whatsoever by operation of law following a criminal conviction or imposed as an additional penalty on sentencing may request the court which convicted him, or, if more than one, the last court to convict him, to end all or part of it, including provisions relating to the length of such ban, forfeiture or incapacity. ...\u201d\n24. Article 703 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:\n\u201cApplications by convicted persons for the ending of a ban ... shall contain particulars of the date of conviction and the places where the applicant has been living since his conviction or release.\nApplications shall be sent to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office or, as the case may be, the Principal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which shall obtain all relevant information and, if appropriate, the opinion of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences, and shall refer the application to the relevant court.\nThe court shall decide applications in private after considering the submissions of the prosecution. It shall hear the applicant or his or her lawyer, but may decide the application in their absence provided due notice has been served on them to attend ...\nA reference to the order ending all or part of a ban, forfeiture or incapacity ... shall be entered on the judgment of the court of trial or retrial and the convicted person\u2019s criminal record.\u201d\nTHE LAW\nALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicant complained in substance that the length of the proceedings which he had brought on 12 August 1994 for rescission of the exclusion order and which had ended with the decision of the Aix-en-Provence Court of Appeal of 26 January 1998 had been unreasonable, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The relevant part of that provision reads as follows :\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...\u201d\nApplicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n26.

In his memorial to the Court the applicant raised several complaints under Articles 3, 6, 7 \u00a7 1 and 10 of the Convention. The Court observes that only the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression was declared admissible by the Commission (see paragraphs 16-17 above).\n20. The Court is therefore required to examine only the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 10 (see, mutatis mutandis, the McGinley and Egan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, pp. 1354-55, \u00a7\u00a7 68-70).\nii. alleged violation of article 10 of the convention\n21. Mr Janowski submitted that his conviction for insulting the municipal guards had infringed his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\nThe Commission agreed with the applicant\u2019s arguments, whereas the Government contended that the facts of the case disclosed no breach of Article 10.\n#### A. Existence of an interference\n22. The participants in the proceedings were agreed that the applicant\u2019s conviction amounted to an interference with the exercise of his right to freedom of expression.

The applicant alleged a breach of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\u201d\n25. The Government maintained that, for three main reasons, Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was not applicable to the facts of the present case or, in the alternative, that there had been no violation of that provision.\n#### A. Whether the United Kingdom can be held responsible under the Convention for the lack of elections to the European Parliament in Gibraltar\n26. According to the Government, the applicant\u2019s real objection was to Council Decision 76/787 and to the 1976 Act concerning elections to the European Parliament (see paragraph 18 above). That Act, which had the status of a treaty, was adopted in the Community framework and could not be revoked or varied unilaterally by the United Kingdom. The Government underlined that the European Commission of Human Rights had refused on a number of occasions to subject measures falling within the Community legal order to scrutiny under the Convention. Whilst they accepted that there might be circumstances in which a Contracting Party might infringe its obligations under the Convention by entering into treaty obligations which were incompatible with the Convention, they considered that in the present case, which concerned texts adopted in the framework of the European Community, the position was not the same. Thus, acts adopted by the Community or consequent to its requirements could not be imputed to the member States, together or individually, particularly when those acts concerned elections to a constitutional organ of the Community itself. At the hearing, the Government suggested that to engage the responsibility of any State under the Convention, that State must have a power of effective control over the act complained of. In the case of the provisions relating to the elections to the European Parliament, the United Kingdom Government had no such control.\n27. The applicant disagreed. For her, the Council Decision and 1976 Act constituted an international treaty, rather than an act of an institution whose decisions were not subject to Convention review. She thus considered that the Government remained responsible under the Convention for the effects of the Council Decision and 1976 Act. In the alternative \u2013 that is, if the Council Decision and 1976 Act were to be interpreted as involving a transfer of powers to the Community organs \u2013 the applicant argued, by reference to Commission case-law, that in the absence of any equivalent protection ", "001-58912": "\ufeff\nCASE OF WAITE AND KENNEDY v.

The applicants contended that they had not had a fair hearing by a tribunal on the question of whether, pursuant to the German Provision of Labour (Temporary Staff) Act, a contractual relationship existed between them and ESA. They alleged that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations \u2026, everyone is entitled to a \u2026 hearing \u2026 by [a] \u2026 tribunal \u2026\u201d\n48.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 9 December 1998 and 4 February 1999,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW and practice\n20. At the relevant time the provisions governing the detention and trial of members of the army were contained in the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d), in the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (\u201cthe 1972 Rules\u201d) and in the Queen\u2019s Regulations for the Army 1975 (\u201cthe Queen\u2019s Regulations\u201d).\n21. Since the applicant\u2019s court martial, the law has been amended by, inter alia, the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57) and by the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Regulations\u201d). The provisions detailed below are those applicable at the time of the applicant\u2019s arrest, detention and court martial.\n#### A. Arrest\n22. A warrant for the arrest of a person subject to military law and considered to have deserted or to be absent without leave may be issued by the commanding officer and any such warrant must be addressed to the civilian police. A person arrested pursuant to that warrant must be handed over as soon as is practicable to the military (section 190A of the 1955 Act).\n#### B. Investigation of charges and detention\n23. The relevant rules vary depending on whether the accused is a non-commissioned officer or soldier or, on the other hand, an officer or warrant officer. In the former case (described below), the commanding officer\u2019s powers are generally broader as regards the investigation and pursuit of charges against an accused.\n##### 1. The 1955 Act\n24. Desertion and absence without leave constitute offences under the 1955 Act. The punishment for the offence of desertion is imprisonment for an unlimited term (subject to the sentencing power of the court martial in question) and that for absence without leave is imprisonment for a maximum of two years.\n25. Section 75 of the 1955 Act provides that the allegations against a person subject to military law who is under arrest shall be duly investigated without unnecessary delay and that as soon as may be, either proceedings shall be taken for punishing the offence or he shall be released from arrest. In addition, should that detention last longer than eight days without a court martial being convened, a report (a \u201cdelay report\u201d) on the necessity for further delay shall be made by the person\u2019s commanding officer to the prescribed authority in the prescribed manner and a similar report shall be made to the same authority and in the same manner every eight days until a court martial is assembled or the offence is dealt with summarily or the accused is released from detention.\n26. Any allegation that the person subject to military law has committed an offence under the 1955 Act must be reported in the form of a charge to that person\u2019s commanding officer and, before any action is taken, the commanding officer must investigate the charge (section 76).\n27. After investigation, a charge (which cannot be dealt with summarily) may be dismissed by a commanding officer if he is of the opinion that it ought not to be proceeded with. Moreover, if it appears to the commanding officer that proceedings in respect of the matters to which the charge relates could be, and in the interests of the better administration of justice ought to be, taken against the accused otherwise than under the 1955 Act, the commanding officer may stay further proceedings (sections 77 and 77A).\n28. If the commanding officer has not stayed the charge and if the charge is not one which can be dealt with summarily and it has not been dismissed or if it is a charge which can be dealt with summarily but the commanding officer is of the opinion that it should not be so dealt with, he shall take the \u201cprescribed steps\u201d with a view to the ch", "001-58915": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE BUSCARINI ET AUTRES c.

The Offences against the State Act 1939 is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts.\n20. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act.\n21. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances' legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n22. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the government made when the government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date.\n23. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act.\n24. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the [police] may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.\n2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the [police], fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\u201d\n25. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has, with government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The committee has already commenced its work.\n#### C. Relevant case-law\n26.

This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n27. The Gaming Board for Great Britain (\u201cthe Gaming Board\u201d) is a statutory body, established under Section 10 of the Gaming Act 1968 (\u201cthe 1968 Act\u201d) to inspect and monitor the gaming industry. In order for any company to obtain the requisite gaming licence for premises, a certificate must first be issued by the Gaming Board consenting to the company applying for such a licence (Schedule 2, paragraph 3 (1) of the 1968 Act).\n28. Under Section 19 of the 1968 Act the Gaming Board issues certificates to individuals in order that they be permitted to hold certain positions in the gaming industry. A certificate, once issued, continues in force unless and until it is revoked. The Gaming Board may revoke the certificate at any time if it appears to the Board that the person to whom it relates is not a fit and proper person to perform the specified function or act in the specified capacity (Schedule 5, paragraph 6 of the 1968 Act). Twenty one days\u2019 written notice of the revocation must be given to the certificate holder. The Gaming Board has developed a procedure whereby an individual is sent a letter in which the Board states that it is minded to revoke his certificate. This is followed by the submission of written representations and/or an oral hearing.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of article 6 \u00a7 1 of the convention\n29. The applicant complains that he did not receive a fair hearing in the determination of his civil rights and obligations by the Gaming Board and that the review by the High Court of the Gaming Board\u2019s decision could not adequately remedy any deficiencies in the Section 19 hearing because of the restricted nature of judicial review.\n30.

Ugrekhelidze, judges\nLord Justice Schiemann, ad hoc judge,\nand also of Mr M. de Salvia, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 May and 29 November 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. General planning law\n33. The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) (\u201cthe 1990 Act\u201d) consolidated pre-existing planning law. It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (section 57 of the 1990 Act). A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development (Restormel Borough Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Rabey [1982] Journal of Planning Law 785; John Davies v. Secretary of State for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [1989] Journal of Planning Law 601).\n34. An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority, which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 54A of the 1990 Act).\n35. The 1990 Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State in the event of a refusal of permission (section 78). With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, \u00a7 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State's decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288).\n36. If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission, the local authority may issue an \u201cenforcement notice\u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations (section 172 (1) of the 1990 Act).\n37. There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State on the grounds, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question (section 174). As with the appeal against refusal of permission, the Secretary of State must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector.\n38. Again there is a further right of appeal \u201con a point of law\u201d to the High Court against a decision of the Secretary of State under section 174 (section 289). Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review. It therefore includes a review as to whether a\ndecision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority.\n39. Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice, the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so (section 178 of the 1990 Act).\n#### B. The Caravan Sites Act 1968\n40. Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (\u201cthe 1968 Act\u201d) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years, in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section 23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. Section 16 of the 1968 Act defined \u201cgypsies\u201d as:\n\u201cpersons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or of persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling together as such\u201d.\n41. Section 6 of the 1968 Act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities:\n\u201cto exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gypsies residing in or resorting to their area\u201d.\n42. The Secretary of State could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary (section 9).\n43. Where the Secretary of State was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of Gypsies, or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision, he could \u201cdesignate\u201d that district or county (section 12 of the 1968 Act).\n44. The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway, on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier (section 10).\n45. In addition, section 11 of the 1968 Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section 10.\n#### C. The Cripps Report\n46. By the mid-1970s it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section 6 of the 1968 Act was inadequate, and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems. In February 1976, therefore, the Government asked Sir John Cripps to carry out a study into the operation of the 1968 Act.

The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector\u2019s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority.\n34. Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice, the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so (section 178 of the 1990 Act).\n#### B. Green Belt policy\n35. The purpose of Green Belts and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document PPG 2 (January 1995).\n\u201c1.1. The Government attaches great importance to Green Belts, which have been an essential element of planning policy for some four decades \u2026\n1.4. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the most important attribute of Green Belts is their openness. Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub-regional and regional scale, and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans. They help to protect the countryside, be it in agricultural, forestry or other use. They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development.\n1.5. There are five purposes in Green Belts:\n\u2013 to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas;\n\u2013 to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another;\n\u2013 to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment;\n\u2013 to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and\n\u2013 to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land. \u2026\n2.1. The essential characteristic of Green Belts is their permanence. Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead. \u2026\n3.1. The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is, in addition, a general presumption against inappropriate development within them. Such development should not be approved, except in very special circumstances\u2026\n3.2. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt. It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted. Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm, is clearly outweighed by other considerations. In view of the presumption against inappropriate development, the Secretary of State will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development.\u201d\n#### C. The Caravan Sites Act 1968\n36. Part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (\u201cthe 1968 Act\u201d) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post-war years, in particular the closure\nof commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section 23 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. Section 16 of the 1968 Act defined \u201cgypsies\u201d as:\n\u201cpersons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin, but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen, or of persons engaged in travelling circuses, travelling", "001-59161": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF DULA\u015e v.

Turkey,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (First Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMrs E. Palm, President,\nMrs W. Thomassen,\nMr L. Ferrari Bravo,\nMr B. Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nMr T. Pan\u0163\u00eeru,\nMr R. Maruste, judges,\nMr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc, ad hoc judge,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 September 2000 and 9 January 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Administrative liability\n27. Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cAll acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...\nThe administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.\u201d\n28. The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \u201csocial risk\u201d. Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.\n29. The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional Article 1 of Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides:\n\u201c... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this Law are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts.\u201d\n#### B. Criminal responsibility\n30. The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence\n\u2013 to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179 generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants),\n\u2013 to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article 188),\n\u2013 to issue threats (Article 191),\n\u2013 to make an unlawful search of an individual\u2019s home (Articles 193 and 194),\n\u2013 to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372), or aggravated arson if human life is endangered (Article 382),\n\u2013 to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article 383), or\n\u2013 to damage another\u2019s property intentionally (Articles 526 et seq.).\n31. For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.\n32. If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code. Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons\u2019 hierarchical superior (sections 93 and 95 of Law no. 353 on the Constitution and Procedure of Military Courts).\n33. If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the State, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). The local council decisions may be appealed to the Council of State; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind.\n#### C. Provisions on compensation\n34.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Immigration legislation and rules\n29. Asylum applications are determined by the Secretary of State, pursuant to paragraph 328 of the Immigration Rules and section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 (\u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d). Where leave to enter is refused by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 4 of the 1971 Act, the person may appeal against the refusal to a special adjudicator on the grounds that the removal would be contrary to the United Kingdom\u2019s obligations under the Geneva Convention (section 8 of the 1971 Act).\n30. An appeal lies from the special adjudicator to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (section 20 of the 1971 Act).\n31. Section 21 of the 1971 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) Where in any case:\n(a) an adjudicator has dismissed an appeal, and there has been no further appeal to the Appeal Tribunal, or the tribunal has dismissed an appeal made to them ...; or\n(b) the Appeal Tribunal has affirmed the determination of an adjudicator dismissing an appeal ... the Secretary of State may at any time refer for consideration under this section any matter relating to the case which was not before the adjudicator or Tribunal ...\u201d\n32. Rule 346 of the Immigration Rules provides that the Secretary of State will treat representations as a fresh application if the claim advanced is sufficiently different from the earlier claim. He disregards, in considering whether to treat the representations as a fresh claim, material which is not significant, or is not credible, or was available to the applicant at the time when the previous application was refused or when any appeal was determined.\n#### B. Domestic immigration decisions on Tanzania\n33. There have been a number of domestic cases where special adjudicators have rejected \u201cinternal flight\u201d possibilities for CUF members from Zanzibar. In Masoud Mussa v. the Secretary of State (30 July 1998), the Government pointed out that the Secretary of State\u2019s counsel had not been present to argue the point. In Omar Machano Omar v. the Secretary of State (24 June 1998), the asylum claimant was an escaped prisoner from Zanzibar and a target for internal extradition proceedings. In Salim Saleh Salim v. the Secretary of State (15 January 1998), the adjudicator found that there was no evidence before him to show that the claimant would be any safer on the mainland than in Zanzibar.\n34. In the case of Adam Houiji Foum v. the Secretary of State (10 January 2000), the Immigration Appeal Tribunal allowed the appeal of a Tanzanian asylum-seeker who had been involved in CUF activities, on the basis that, as he had suffered torture in Zanzibar and a summons had been issued against him in Tanzania generally, there was a very reasonable prospect that he would be picked up by the police and undergo ill-treatment similar to that previously received in Zanzibar, either at the hands of the Zanzibar authorities or of the police in mainland Tanzania who also exercised brutality on prisoners in their custody. It therefore rejected the \u201cinternal flight\u201d option.\n#### C. Judicial review in immigration cases\n35. Decisions of the Home Secretary to refuse asylum, to make a deportation order or to detain pending deportation are liable to challenge by way of judicial review and may be quashed by reference to the ordinary principles of English public law.\n36. These principles do not permit the courts to make findings of fact on matters within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State or to substitute their discretion for the minister\u2019s. The courts may quash his decision only if he has failed to interpret or apply English law correctly, if he has failed to take account of issues which he was required by law to address, or if his decision was so irrational or perverse that no reasonable Secretary of State could have made it (Associated Prov", "001-59450": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF HUGH JORDAN v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr W. Fuhrmann,\nMr L. Loucaides,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr K. Traja, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 4 April 2000 and on 11 April 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Use of lethal force\n59. Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 provides inter alia:\n\u201c1. A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting the arrest or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or persons unlawfully at large.\u201d\nSelf-defence or the defence of others is contained within the concept of the prevention of crime (see e.g. Smith and Hogan on Criminal Law).\n#### B. Inquests\n##### 1. Statutory provisions and rules\n60. The conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland is governed by the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 and the Coroners (Practice and Procedure) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1963. These provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the Coroner, who then has the power to hold an inquest, with or without a jury, for the purpose of ascertaining, with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports, inter alia, of post mortem and forensic examinations, who the deceased was and how, when and where he died.\n61. Pursuant to the Coroners Act, every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the Coroner (section 7). Every medical practitioner who performs a post mortem examination has to notify the Coroner of the result in writing (section 29). Whenever a dead body is found, or an unexplained death or death in suspicious circumstances occurs, the police of that district are required to give notice to the Coroner (section 8).\n62. Rules 12 and 13 of the Coroners Rules give power to the Coroner to adjourn an inquest where a person may be or has been charged with murder or other specified criminal offences in relation to the deceased.\n63. Where the Coroner decides to hold an inquest with a jury, persons are called from the Jury List, compiled by random computer selection from the electoral register for the district on the same basis as in criminal trials.\n64. The matters in issue at an inquest are governed by Rules 15 and 16 of the Coroners Rules:\n\u201c15. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely: -\n(a) who the deceased was;\n(b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;\n(c) the particulars for the time being required by the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 to be registered concerning his death.\n16. Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any matters other than those referred to in the last foregoing Rule.\u201d\n65. The forms of verdict used in Northern Ireland accord with this recommendation, recording the name and other particulars of the deceased, a statement of the cause of death (e.g. bullet wounds) and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death. In England and Wales, the form of verdict appended to the English Coroners Rules contains a section marked \u201cconclusions of the jury/coroner as to the death\u201d in which conclusions such as \u201clawfully killed\u201d or \u201ckilled unlawfully\u201d are inserted. These findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act, but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable. The jury in England and Wales may also append recommendations to their verdict.\n66. However, in Northern Ireland, the Coroner is under a duty (section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Order (Northern Ireland) 1972) to furnish a written report to the DPP where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed.\n67. Until recently, legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges. Legislation which would have provided for legal aid at the hearing of inquests (the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, Schedule 1 paragraph 5) has not been brought into force. However, on 25 July 2000, the Lord Chancellor announced the establishment of an Extra-Statutory Ex Gratia Scheme to make public funding available for representation for proceedings before Coroners in exceptional inquests in Northern Ireland. In March 2001, he published for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether applications for representation at inquests should receive public funding. This included inter alia consideration of financial eligibility, whether an effective investigation by the State was needed and whether the inquest was the only way to conduct it, whether the applicant required representation to be able to participate effectively in the inquest and whether the applicant had a sufficiently close relationship to the deceased.\n68. The Coroner enjoys the power to summon witnesses who he thinks it necessary to attend the inquest (section 17 of the Coroners Act) and he may allow any interested person to examine a witness (Rule 7). In both England and Wales and Northern Ireland, a witness is entitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination. In Northern Ireland, this privilege is reinforced by Rule 9(2) which provides that a person suspected of causing the death may not be compelled to give evidence at the inquest.\n69. In relation to both documentary evidence and the oral evidence of witnesses, inquests, like criminal trials, are subject to the law of public interest immunity, which recognises and gives effect to the public interest, such as national security, in the non-disclosure of certain information or certain documents or classes of document. A claim of public interest immunity must be supported by a certificate.\n##### 2. The scope of inquests\n70. Rules 15 and 16 (see above) follow from the recommendation of the Brodrick Committee on Death Certification and Coroners:\n\u201c... the function of an inquest should be simply to seek out and record as many of the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires, without deducing from those facts any determination of blame... In many cases, perhaps the majority, the facts themselves will demonstrate quite clearly whether anyone bears any responsibility for the death; there is a difference between a form of proceeding which affords to others the opportunity to judge an issue and one which appears to judge the issue itself.\u201d\n71. Domestic courts have made, inter alia, the following comments:\n\u201c... It is noteworthy that the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died, which might raise general and far-reaching issues, but \u2018how...the deceased came by his death\u2019, a far more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death.\n... [previous judgments] make it clear that when the Brodrick Committee stated that one of the purposes of an inquest is \u2018To allay rumours or suspicions\u2019 this purpose should be confined to allaying rumours and suspicions of how the deceased came by his death and not to allaying rumours or suspicions about the broad circumstances in which the deceased came by his death.\u201d (Sir Thomas Bingham, MR, Court of Appeal, R. v the Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe ex parte Roy Jamieson, April 1994, unreported)\n\u201cThe cases establish that although the word \u2018how\u2019 is to be widely interpreted, it means \u2018by what means\u2019 rather than in what broad circumstances ... In short, the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative of death and must, indeed, be confined to those matters alone ...\u201d (Simon Brown LJ, Court of Appeal, R. v. Coroner for Western District of East Sussex, ex parte Homberg and others, (1994) 158 JP 357)\n\u201c... it should not be forgotten that an inquest is a fact finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt. The procedure and rules of evidence which are suitable for one are unsuitable for the other. In an inquest it should never be forgotten that there are no parties, no indictment, there is no prosecution, there is no defence, there is no trial, simply an attempt to establish the facts. It is an inquisitorial process, a process of investigation quite unlike a trial...\nIt is well recognised that a purpose of an inquest is that rumour may be allayed. But that does not mean it is the duty of the Coroner to investigate at an inquest every rumour or allegation that may be brought to his attention. It is ... his duty to discharge his statutory role - the scope of his enquiry must not be allowed to drift into the uncharted seas of rumour and allegation. He will proceed safely and properly if he investigates the facts which it appears are relevant to the statutory issues before him.\u201d (Lord Lane, Court of Appeal, R v. South London Coroner ex parte Thompson (1982) 126 SJ 625)\n##### 3. Disclosure of documents\n72.

These provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the Coroner, who then has the power to hold an inquest, with or without a jury, for the purpose of ascertaining, with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports, inter alia, of post mortem and forensic examinations, who the deceased was and how, when and where he died.\n43. Pursuant to the Coroners Act, every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the Coroner (section 7). Every medical practitioner who performs a post mortem examination has to notify the Coroner of the result in writing (section 29). Whenever a dead body is found, or an unexplained death or death in suspicious circumstances occurs, the police of that district are required to give notice to the Coroner (section 8).\n44. Rules 12 and 13 of the Coroners Rules give power to the Coroner to adjourn an inquest where a person may be or has been charged with murder or other specified criminal offences in relation to the deceased.\n45. Where the Coroner decides to hold an inquest with a jury, persons are called from the Jury List, compiled by random computer selection from the electoral register for the district on the same basis as in criminal trials.\n46. The matters in issue at an inquest are governed by Rules 15 and 16 of the Coroners Rules:\n\u201c15. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely: \u2013\n(a) who the deceased was;\n(b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;\n(c) the particulars for the time being required by the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 to be registered concerning his death.\n16. Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any matters other than those referred to in the last foregoing Rule.\u201d\n47. The forms of verdict used in Northern Ireland accord with this recommendation, recording the name and other particulars of the deceased, a statement of the cause of death (e.g. bullet wounds) and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death. In England and Wales, the form of verdict appended to the English Coroners Rules contains a section marked \u201cconclusions of the jury/coroner as to the death\u201d in which conclusions such as \u201clawfully killed\u201d or \u201ckilled unlawfully\u201d are inserted. These findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act, but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable. The jury in England and Wales may also append recommendations to their verdict.\n48. However, in Northern Ireland, the Coroner is under a duty (section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Order (Northern Ireland) 1972) to furnish a written report to the DPP where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed.\n49. Until recently, legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges. Legislation which would have provided for legal aid at the hearing of inquests (the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, Schedule 1 paragraph 5) has not been brought into force. However, on 25 July 2000, the Lord Chancellor announced the establishment of an Extra-Statutory Ex Gratia Scheme to make public funding available for representation for proceedings before Coroners in exceptional inquests in Northern Ireland. In March 2001, he published for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether applications for representation at inquests should receive public funding. This included inter alia consideration of financial eligibility, whether an effective investigation by the State was needed and whether the inquest was the only way to conduct it, whether the applicant required representation to be able to participate effectively in the inquest and whether the applicant had a sufficiently close relationship to the deceased.\n50. The Coroner enjoys the power to summon witnesses who he thinks it necessary to attend the inquest (section 17 of the Coroners Act) and he may allow any interested person to examine a witness (Rule 7). In both England and Wales and Northern Ireland, a witness is entitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination. In Northern Ireland, this privilege is reinforced by Rule 9(2) which provides that a person suspected of causing the death may not be compelled to give evidence at the inquest.\n51. In relation to both documentary evidence and the oral evidence of witnesses, inquests, like criminal trials, are subject to the law of public interest immunity, which recognises and gives effect to the public interest, such as national security, in the non-disclosure of certain information or certain documents or classes of document. A claim of public interest immunity must be supported by a certificate.\n##### 2. The scope of inquests\n52. Rules 15 and 16 (see above) follow from the recommendation of the Brodrick Committee on Death Certification and Coroners:\n\u201c... the function of an inquest should be simply to seek out and record as many of the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires, without deducing from those facts any determination of blame... In many cases, perhaps the majority, the facts themselves will demonstrate quite clearly whether anyone bears any responsibility for the death; there is a difference between a form of proceeding which affords to others the opportunity to judge an issue and one which appears to judge the issue itself.\u201d\n53. Domestic courts have made, inter alia, the following comments:\n\u201c... It is noteworthy that the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died, which might raise general and far-reaching issues, but 'how...the deceased came by his death', a far more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death.\n... [previous judgments] make it clear that when the Brodrick Committee stated that one of the purposes of an inquest is 'To allay rumours or suspicions' this purpose should be confined to allaying rumours and suspicions of how the deceased came by his death and not to allaying rumours or suspicions about the broad circumstances in which the deceased came by his death.\u201d (Sir Thomas Bingham, MR, Court of Appeal, R. v the Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe ex parte Roy Jamieson, April 1994, unreported)\n\u201cThe cases establish that although the word 'how' is to be widely interpreted, it means 'by what means' rather than in what broad circumstances ... In short, the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative of death and must, indeed, be confined to those matters alone ...\u201d (Simon Brown LJ, Court of Appeal, R. v. Coroner for Western District of East Sussex, ex parte Homberg and others, (1994) 158 JP 357)\n\u201c... it should not be forgotten that an inquest is a fact finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt. The procedure and rules of evidence which are suitable for one are unsuitable for the other. In an inquest it should never be forgotten that there are no parties, no indictment, there is no prosecution, there is no defence, there is no trial, simply an attempt to establish the facts. It is an inquisitorial process, a process of investigation quite unlike a trial...\nIt is well recognised that a purpose of an inquest is that rumour may be allayed. But that does not mean it is the duty of the Coroner to investigate at an inquest every rumour or allegation that may be brought to his attention. It is ... his duty to discharge his statutory role - the scope of his enquiry must not be allowed to drift into the uncharted seas of rumour and allegation. He will proceed safely and properly if he investigates the facts which it appears are relevant to the statutory issues before him.\u201d (Lord Lane, Court of Appeal, R. v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Use of lethal force\n47. Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 provides inter alia:\n\u201c1. A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting the arrest or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or persons unlawfully at large.\u201d\nSelf-defence or the defence of others is contained within the concept of the prevention of crime (see e.g. Smith and Hogan on Criminal Law).\n#### B. Inquests\n##### 1. Statutory provisions and rules\n48. The conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland is governed by the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 and the Coroners (Practice and Procedure) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1963. These provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the Coroner, who then has the power to hold an inquest, with or without a jury, for the purpose of ascertaining, with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports, inter alia, of post mortem and forensic examinations, who the deceased was and how, when and where he died.\n49. Pursuant to the Coroners Act, every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the Coroner (section 7). Every medical practitioner who performs a post mortem examination has to notify the Coroner of the result in writing (section 29). Whenever a dead body is found, or an unexplained death or death in suspicious circumstances occurs, the police of that district are required to give notice to the Coroner (section 8).\n50. Rules 12 and 13 of the Coroners Rules give power to the Coroner to adjourn an inquest where a person may be or has been charged with murder or other specified criminal offences in relation to the deceased.\n51. Where the Coroner decides to hold an inquest with a jury, persons are called from the Jury List, compiled by random computer selection from the electoral register for the district on the same basis as in criminal trials.\n52. The matters in issue at an inquest are governed by Rules 15 and 16 of the Coroners Rules:\n\u201c15. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely: -\n(a) who the deceased was;\n(b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;\n(c) the particulars for the time being required by the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 to be registered concerning his death.\n16. Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any matters other than those referred to in the last foregoing Rule.\u201d\n53. The forms of verdict used in Northern Ireland accord with this recommendation, recording the name and other particulars of the deceased, a statement of the cause of death (e.g. bullet wounds) and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death. In England and Wales, the form of verdict appended to the English Coroners Rules contains a section marked \u201cconclusions of the jury/coroner as to the death\u201d in which conclusions such as \u201clawfully killed\u201d or \u201ckilled unlawfully\u201d are inserted. These findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act, but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable. The jury in England and Wales may also append recommendations to their verdict.\n54. However, in Northern Ireland, the Coroner is under a duty (section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Order (Northern Ireland) 1972) to furnish a written report to the DPP where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed.\n55. Until recently, legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges.

There was no requirement prior to 1999 for the families at inquests to receive copies of the written statements or documents submitted to the Coroner during the inquest.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Origins and development of the administrative courts\n28. The history of France\u2019s administrative courts is essentially that of the Conseil d\u2019Etat. In 1790 the Constituent Assembly implemented the theory of the separation of powers and organised matters so that the executive would not be subject to the judiciary. It preserved the ancien r\u00e9gime principle that administrative authorities should be tried by a special court, in accordance with the idea that judging the administrative authorities was \u201calso an administrative act\u201d. Such a special court was set up by the Consulate in 1799. This was the Conseil d\u2019Etat, which was instituted by Article 52 of the Constitution of 22 Frimaire Year VIII (13 December 1799). It was given responsibilities in two areas: administrative (contributing to the drafting of major enactments) and judicial (settling disputes connected with the administrative authorities).\n29. In 1849 an Act vested it with the administration of \u201cdelegated\u201d justice (la justice d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e), and thereafter it accordingly gave its rulings \u201cin the name of the French people\u201d. During the Third Republic the Conseil d\u2019Etat acquired an organisational pattern that it still largely has today. Its function was laid down in the Act of 24 May 1872, which amended the 1849 Act and established delegated justice permanently.\n30. The main feature of the post-war period was the organisation of the administrative jurisdiction. In 1953 the administrative courts (of first instance) succeeded the prefectural councils, which had existed since 1799. The 1958 Constitution, which contains only three Articles \u2013 64, 65 and 66 \u2013 relating to the judiciary, in particular, to provide that judges (but not members of State Counsel\u2019s offices) are irremovable, does not mention the Conseil d\u2019Etat or the other administrative courts under this head. The Act of 31 December 1987, which came into force in 1989, added to the courts vested with administrative jurisdiction the administrative courts of appeal, to which the bulk of the appellate jurisdiction was transferred. From these new courts and various specialised courts, such as the Court of Audit, an appeal on points of law lies to the Conseil d\u2019Etat as the supreme administrative court.\n#### B. Status of judges of the administrative courts\n31. The judges of the administrative courts have a special status different from that of the judges of the ordinary courts and the members of State Counsel\u2019s Office at those courts. They are governed by the general rules on the civil service; however, they are in practice both independent and irremovable (see paragraph 35 below). In 1980 a decision of the Constitutional Council (22 July 1980, Official Gazette of 24 July, p. 1868) established the existence and independence of the administrative jurisdiction as being among the fundamental principles recognised in the laws of the Republic having constitutional rank.\n32. The Conseil d\u2019Etat has about 300 members, two-thirds of whom work within the Conseil and one-third outside it. Its nominal President is the Prime Minister and in practice the Vice-President of the Conseil d\u2019Etat presides. By Article 13, third paragraph, of the Constitution, concerning the powers of appointment of the President of the Republic, all the senior members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat (conseillers d\u2019Etat) are appointed by decree of the President of the Republic adopted in Cabinet, while the junior legal assistants (auditeurs) and the middle-ranking ma\u00eetres des requ\u00eates are appointed by an ordinary presidential decree, under section 2 of the Ordinance of 28 November 1958 on civil and military appointments.\n##### 1. Recruitment of members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat\n33. The members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat are recruited in one of two ways: through competitive examination or directly from other parts of the civil service. Legal assistants, recruited through competitive examination, are promoted to the rank of ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates after about three years\u2019 service and become conseillers d\u2019Etat about twelve years later. External appointments are subject to approval by the Vice-President of the Conseil d\u2019Etat.\n##### 2. Guarantees of independence\n34. The status of the members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat is not so much laid down in writing as guaranteed in practice. As regards written rules, mention must be made of the decree of 30 July 1963 laying down the rights and duties of members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat. These rights and duties are very similar to those applying to the civil service (and, in particular, no provision is made for irremovability), with a number of exceptions: no provision is made for assessment, no promotions table is drawn up and an advisory committee replaces both the Joint Administrative Committee and the Joint Technical Committee.\n35. It is thus, rather, practice which provides the guarantees enjoyed by the members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat. Three traditional practices are both very long-standing and decisive: firstly, the Conseil d\u2019Etat and its members are managed internally by the Executive Committee (bureau) of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, consisting of the Vice-President, the six division presidents and the Secretary-General of the Conseil d\u2019Etat, without any outside interference. In particular, there is no distinction in the Conseil d\u2019Etat between judges and members of State Counsel\u2019s Office as there is in the ordinary courts, where the members of State Counsel\u2019s Office are subordinated to the Minister of Justice.\nSecondly, even though there is no written provision guaranteeing the irremovability of members of the Conseil, that guarantee exists in practice. Lastly, while promotion is theoretically by selection, it is in practice \u2013 by a custom which goes back to the middle of the nineteenth century \u2013 strictly by seniority, and this guarantees the members of the Conseil d\u2019Etat great independence, vis-\u00e0-vis both the political authorities and the authorities of the Conseil d\u2019Etat themselves.\n36. Most duties within the Conseil d\u2019Etat can be performed by members of any grade. Thus the duties of Government Commissioner, although generally given to ma\u00eetres des requ\u00eates, can also be carried out by auditeurs or conseillers d\u2019Etat.\n37. The Act of 31 December 1987 instituted a National Council of Administrative Courts and Administrative Courts of Appeal, whose membership ensures that it is independent and representative. The Council has a general advisory role in relation to matters concerning the staff of all the administrative courts (individual measures affecting judges\u2019 careers, promotion and discipline).\n#### C. Judicial work\n38. Procedure in the administrative courts has developed essentially under the influence of the courts themselves. It attempts to achieve a compromise between the public interest \u2013 represented in the proceedings by the administrative authorities \u2013 and the interests of individuals, who must be effectively protected from misuse of ", "001-59518": "\ufeff\nCASE OF MEDENICA v.

The applicant alleged that the Swiss courts had failed to respect the rights of the defence. He complained, in particular, that the Canton of Geneva Assize Court had convicted him in absentia. He relied on Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, the relevant parts of which provide:\n\u201c1. ... everyone is entitled to a fair hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing ...\u201d\n#### A. Arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The applicant\n44. The applicant stressed that he had been prevented from appearing at the trial in Geneva on 17 April 1989 through no fault of his own. He argued that he had not been guilty of any culpable conduct. He had at no stage suggested that he was the only doctor capable of providing his patient S. with effective treatment in the United States. On the other hand, he did assert that he was the first doctor of the many S. had consulted to succeed in improving his condition through treatment when S.\u2019s life expectancy \u2013 according to the specialists he had previously consulted \u2013 was only four weeks. He had therefore replied to the questions which the American court had put to him in all conscience and could not be accused of culpable conduct for having done so.\n45. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Swiss courts\u2019 argument that he had failed to take elementary precautions to avoid being absent from his trial was untenable.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n32. At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence.\n33. In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ([1982] vol. 74 Criminal Appeal Reports p. 302: \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d). The Guidelines attempted to codify the rules of disclosure and to define the prosecution\u2019s power to withhold \u201cunused material\u201d. Under paragraph 1, \u201cunused material\u201d was defined as:\n\u201c(i) All witness statements and documents which are not included in the committal bundle served on the defence; (ii) the statements of any witnesses who are to be called to give evidence at the committal and (if not in the bundle) any documents referred to therein; (iii) the unedited version(s) of any edited statements or composite statement included in the committal bundles.\u201d\nUnder paragraph 2, any item falling within this definition was to be made available to th", "001-59527": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF BECK v.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 February and 14 June 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011\nmentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Drug Trafficking Act 1994\n19. Section 2 of the 1994 Act provides that a Crown Court should make a confiscation order in respect of a defendant appearing before it for sentencing in respect of one or more drug-trafficking offences, whom the court finds to have received at any time any payment or other reward in connection with drug trafficking.\n20. Under section 5 of the 1994 Act, the confiscation order should be set at a sum corresponding to the proceeds of drug trafficking assessed by the court to have been gained by the defendant, unless the court is satisfied that, at the time the confiscation order is made, only a lesser sum could be realised.\n21. In determining whether and to what extent the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking, section 4(2) and (3) of the 1994 Act require the court to assume that any property appearing to have been held by the defendant at any time since his conviction or during the period of six years before the date on which the criminal proceedings were commenced was received as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking, and that any expenditure incurred by him during the same period was paid for out of the proceeds of drug trafficking. This statutory assumption may be set aside by the defendant in relation to any particular property or expenditure if it is shown to be incorrect or if there would be a serious risk of injustice if it were applied (section 4(4)).\n22. The required standard of proof applicable throughout the 1994 Act is that applied in civil proceedings, namely on the balance of probabilities (section 2(8)).\n23. Provisions broadly similar to the above were previously included in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (\u201cthe 1986 Act\u201d, considered by the Court in Welch v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 9 February 1995, Series A no. 307-A).\n#### B. Recent British case-law on the application of the Convention to drug confiscation orders\n1. McIntosh v. Her Majesty\u2019s Advocate \u2013 judgment of the Scottish Court of Appeal\n24. In its judgment of 13 October 2000 the Scottish Court of Appeal, by a majority of two to one, held that a confiscation procedure similar to that applied in the present case was incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. Lord Prosser, with whom Lord Allanbridge agreed, observed, inter alia:\n\u201c... By asking the court to make a confiscation order, the prosecutor is asking it to assess the value of the proceeds of the petitioner\u2019s drug trafficking. It is therefore asking the court to reach the stage of saying that he has trafficked in drugs. If that is criminal, that seems to me to be closely analogous to an actual charge of an actual crime, in Scottish terms. There is of course no indictment or complaint, and no conviction. And the advocate depute pointed out a further difference, that a Scottish complaint or indictment would have to be specific, and would require evidence, whereas this particular alleg", "001-59565": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF PRICE v.

Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment, custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure have a \u2018tariff\u2019 set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. After the expiry of the tariff, the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence. Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change, most notably, following the coming into force on 1 October 1992 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d), which was in force at the relevant time. The provisions of the 1991 Act were replaced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d) from 1 October 1997.\n24.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n23. Section 12 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1984 provided at the relevant time:\n\u201c(1) Subject to sub-section (2) ..., a constable may arrest without warrant a person whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be:\n...\n(b) a person who is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism to which this Part of this Act applies;\n...\n(4) A person arrested under this section shall not be detained in right of the arrest for more than forty-eight hours after his arrest; but the Secretary of State may, in any particular case, extend the period of forty-eight hours by a period or periods specified by him.\u201d\n24. This provision sets a test of an honest suspicion upon reasonable grounds, involving an objective element. Domestic case-law indicates that an arrest will be unlawful where, although there was an honest suspicion on the part of the arresting officer, that suspicion was not objectively reasonable (see, for example, Foulkes v. Chief Constable of the Merseyside Police [1998] 3 All England Law Reports 705).\n25. Although section 12 concerns the suspicion held by the arresting officer, where a briefing officer has told an arresting officer that there is reliable information when there is not, the Chief Constable may become vicariously liable for a wrongful arrest, on behalf of the briefing officer, not the arresting officer (see Clarke v. Chief Constable of North Wales Police, 5 April 2000).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained about his arrest on 28 December 1985, relying on Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which provide:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n...\u201d\n#### A. Submissions of the parties\n27. The applicant submitted that, as he had never been a member of the IRA or been involved in the murder, the police could not have received reliable information to that effect. He pointed out that it was never suggested to him during his interviews with the police that they had information from any source implicating him in this way or regarding the nature of his alleged involvement. The Government had not provided any documentation or details to support their bare assertion that any such information was received.\n28. The applicant alleged that his arrest and detention by the police was to harass him and put pressure on him as he was a prominent member of Sinn Fein. He stated that he had been arrested on at least thirty occasions and detained for various periods of time and had successfully claimed compensation for wrongful arrest and detention. In these circumstances, where there was a real possibility that the police were motivated by malice, particular care should be taken in assessing the sufficiency of the information provided regarding the grounds of suspicion.\n29.

Section 42 of the 1976 Act (as amended) provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub-section (2) shall be received", "001-59854": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF B\u00dcRKEV v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n28. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of other serious offences (such as manslaughter or rape) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside. Where an offender is under 18 years of age when the offence of murder is committed, he or she is sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure (section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933).\n29. As at 31 December 2001 there were 3,171 male and 114 female mandatory life prisoners, 228 men and 11 women serving a sentence of detention during Her Majesty's pleasure and 1,424 male and 25 female discretionary life prisoners.\n#### B. Tariffs\n30. Over the years, the Secretary of State has adopted a \u201ctariff\u201d policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 505-07). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The \u201ctariff\u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Home Secretary will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte V. and T. [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp. 492G-493A).\n31. According to section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d), the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After the tariff has expired, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board, which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public.\n32. A different regime, however, applied under the 1991 Act to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (now replaced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d), sections 28-34). In relation to these prisoners, the Secretary of State decides the length of the tariff. The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial, as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State, who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531; and see the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard's, policy statement to Parliament, 27 July 1993, Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 861-64).\n33. In the judicial review proceedings in Ex parte V. and T. (cited above), the House of Lords gave consideration, inter alia, to the nature of the tariff-fixing exercise.\n34. Lord Steyn held:\n\u201cThe starting-point must to be inquire into the nature of the power to fix a tariff which the Home Secretary exercises. Writing on behalf of the Home Secretary the Home Office explained that: 'The Home Secretary must ensure that, at all times, he acts with the same dispassionate fairness as a sentencing judge.' The comparison between the position of the Home Secretary, when he fixes a tariff representing the punitive element of the sentence, and the position of the sentencing judge is correct. In fixing a tariff the Home Secretary is carrying out, contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary, a classic judicial function. Parliament entrusted the underlying statutory power, which entailed a discretion to adopt a policy and fix a tariff, to the Home Secretary. But the power to fix a tariff is nevertheless equivalent to a judge's sentencing power.\u201d\n35. Lord Hope held:\n\u201cBut the imposition of a tariff, which is intended to fix the minimum period in custody is, in itself, the imposition of a form of punishment. This has, as Lord Mustill observed in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody at p. 557A-B, the characteristics of an orthodox judicial exercise, which is directed to the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender and to what, having regard to the requirements of retribution and deterrence, is the appropriate minimum period to be spent in custody. The judge, when advising the Secretary of State about the tariff, must and does confine his attention to these matters ...\nIf the Secretary of State wishes to fix a tariff for the case \u2013 in order to replace the views of the judiciary with a view of his own about the length of the minimum period \u2013 he must be careful to abide by the same rules ...\u201d\n36. In Ex parte Pierson [1998] Appeal Cases 539, Lord Steyn stated, in a case concerning mandatory life prisoners:\n\u201cIn public law the emphasis should be on substance rather than form. The case should not be decided on a semantic quibble about whether the Home Secretary's function is strictly 'a sentencing exercise'. The undeniable fact is that in fixing a tariff in the individual case the Home Secretary is making a decision about the punishment of the convicted man. In any event, a majority holding in Ex Parte V. concludes the matter ... This point is therefore settled by the binding authority of a decision of the House.\u201d\n37. A whole life tariff may be set in appropriate cases. In R. v. the Home Secretary, ex parte Hindley [2001] 1 Appeal Cases, where a provisional tariff of thirty years had been replaced by a whole life tariff, Lord Steyn held that \u201clife-long incarceration for the purposes of punishment is competent where the crime or crimes are sufficiently heinous\u201d.

Kovler,\nand also of Mrs M. de Boer-Buquicchio, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 7 November 2001 and 17 April 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n30. The Gaming Board for Great Britain (\u201cthe Gaming Board\u201d) is a statutory body, established under section 10 of the Gaming Act 1968 (\u201cthe 1968 Act\u201d) to regulate and monitor the gaming industry. In order for any company to obtain the requisite gaming licence for premises, a certificate must first be issued by the Gaming Board consenting to the company applying for such a licence (Schedule 2, paragraph 3(1), of the 1968 Act).\n31. Under section 19 of the 1968 Act the Gaming Board issues certificates to individuals in order that they be permitted to hold certain positions in the gaming industry. A certificate, once issued, continues to be in force unless and until it is revoked. The Gaming Board may revoke the certificate at any time if it appears to the Board that the person to whom it relates is not a fit and proper person to perform the specified function or act in the specified capacity (Schedule 5, paragraph 6, of the 1968 Act). Twenty-one days' written notice of the revocation must be given to the certificate holder. The Gaming Board has developed a procedure whereby an individual is sent a letter in which the Board states that it is minded to revoke his certificate. This is followed by the submission of written representations and/or an oral hearing.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. In its judgment of 7 November 2000, the Chamber found that the proceedings before the Gaming Board, the High Court and the Court of Appeal determined the applicant's civil rights and obligations, so that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable (see paragraphs 42-45 of the judgment).\nIn connection with the question whether the Panel of the Gaming Board was an \u201cindependent and impartial tribunal\u201d, the Chamber held, as a preliminary point, that, since the applicant had not pursued an allegation of actual bias before the domestic courts, it was not open to him to raise such a complaint before the Chamber (see paragraph 48).\nThe Chamber considered that the Panel did not present the necessary appearance of impartiality at the section 19 hearing in April 1994 given that it had already decided in January 1993 that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to hold a gaming certificate (see paragraphs 49-50). The Chamber observed that, according to the case-law, even where an adjudicatory body determining disputes over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d does not comply with Article 6 \u00a7 1, there is no breach of the Convention if the proceedings before that body are \u201csubject to subsequent control by a judicial body that has full jurisdiction and does provide the guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1\u201d. On the question whether the High Court and the Court of Appeal satisfied the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 as far as the scope of their jurisdiction was concerned, the Chamber observed:\n\u201c52.

Under United Kingdom law, certain social-security benefits, including widow's payment, widowed mother's allowance and widow's pension, are paid for out of the National Insurance Fund. By section 1 of the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d), the funds required for paying such benefits are to be provided by means of contributions payable to the Secretary of State for Social Security by earners, employers and others, together with certain additions made to the Fund by Parliament.\n15. Male and female earners are obliged to pay the same social-security contributions in accordance with their status as employed earners or self-employed earners.\nWidow's payment\n16. Under section 36 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed is entitled to a widow's payment (a lump sum payment of GBP 1,000) if:\n(i) she is under pensionable age at the time when her husband died, or he was not then entitled to a Category A retirement pension; and\n(ii) her husband satisfied certain specified social-security contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the 1992 Act.\nWidowed mother's allowance\n17. Under the relevant part of section 37 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed (and who has not remarried) is entitled to a mother's allowance on certain conditions, the following being the conditions relevant to the circumstance of the present case:\n(i) her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the Act; and\n(ii) she is entitled to receive child benefit in relation to a son or daughter of herself and her late husband.\nThe widowed mother's allowance currently amounts to GBP 72.50 per week, with an extra GBP 9.70 per week in respect of the eldest eligible child, and a further GBP 11.35 per week in respect of other children.\nWidow's pension\n18. Under section 38 of the 1992 Act, a woman who has been widowed (and who is not remarried) is entitled to a widow's pension if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a schedule to the Act; and\n(i) at the date of her husband's death she was over the age of 45 but under the age of 65; or\n(ii) she ceased to be entitled to a widowed mother's allowance at the time she was over the age of 45 but under the age of 65.\nIf the applicant were a woman, he could look forward to entitlement to a widow's pension at some stage between 2006 and 2009, depending on when his youngest child ceased to be a dependant, at which time he would no longer be entitled to the widowed mother's allowance.\nTime-limit for applications for benefits\n19. Section 1(1) of the 1992 Act, which applies to the applicant, provides that no entitlement to a benefit arises unless a claim for the benefit is made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time.\nAt the relevant time, the time-limits for claiming a widow's payment and a widowed mother's allowance were set out in the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrume", "001-60513": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF \u0130\u011eDEL\u0130 v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 4 September 2001 and 4 June 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The statutory basis for the offence (d\u00e9lit) of publicly insulting a foreign head of State is section 36 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 (\u201cthe 1881 Act\u201d), which, at the material time, read as follows: \u201cIt shall be an offence punishable by one year\u2019s imprisonment or a fine of 300,000 francs or both publicly to insult a foreign head of State, a foreign head of government or the minister for foreign affairs of a foreign government.\u201d\n23. That provision was amended by the Presumption of Innocence and Victims (Reinforcement of Rights) Act of 15 June 2000, which removed the power to impose a custodial sentence for this offence.\n24. The rationale behind making it a criminal offence to insult a foreign head of State is to protect senior foreign political figures from certain forms of attack on their honour or dignity. In that regard, the offence is similar to that established by section 26 of the same Act of insulting the President of the French Republic.\n25. Under the case-law, the notion of insulting a foreign head of State is to be construed as meaning abuse, defamatory remarks, or expressions that are insulting or liable to offend the sensibilities of the persons the Act seeks to protect. Thus, the Court of Cassation has ruled: \u201cThe actus reus of the offence of insulting a head of State ... is constituted by any expression of contempt or abuse or any accusation that is liable to undermine the honour or dignity of the head of State in his or her private life or in the performance of his or her functions\u201d (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division (\u201cCass. crim.\u201d), decision of 17 July 1986).\n26. The 1881 Act established a specific legal procedure for the offence. Section 48 introduced a special legal rule by providing that a prosecution will only lie at the request of the person at whom the insults are directed. Requests must be sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who then communicates them to the Minister of Justice. Furthermore, unlike the position with criminal defamation, bad faith is not presumed. It is for the prosecution to prove malice. On the other hand, the defence of justification (exceptio veritatis), which is available to a charge of criminal defamation, cannot be pleaded on a charge of insulting a foreign head of State. Lastly, sections 42 and 43 establish a system of different levels of liability, with editors-in-chief and editors being prosecuted as principals, and the authors of the offending articles as accomplices.\n27.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Imprisonment in default\n25. Imprisonment in default is a surviving relic of the debtors' prison, and entails jail for the recalcitrant debtor. It is now only available as a remedy to the Treasury and guarantees the recovery of money owed to the State, such as financial penalties or any other sums due to the Treasury apart from civil reparation.\n26. When the applicant was convicted, Article L.627-6 of the Public Health Code was still in force and provided:\nAs an exception to the provisions of Article 750 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the length of imprisonment in default shall be two years where fines and any other pecuniary penalties imposed for any of the offences mentioned in the preceding paragraph or for the related customs offences exceed FRF 500,000.\u201d\n27. Article 706-31 of the New Code of Criminal Procedure, which came into force on 1 March 1994, contains identical provisions.\n28. Article 382 of the Customs Code provides:\n\u201cJudgments concerning customs offences may be executed by any means provided for by law.\nJudgments by which persons are convicted of offences against customs legislation shall also be enforceable by imprisonment in default ...\u201d\n29. Article 388 of the Customs Code provides:\n\u201cA person convicted of a customs offence or an offence relating to indirect taxation may, where the court makes an express order to that effect, be kept in detention, even if an ordinary appeal or an appeal on points of law has been lodged, until he has paid the fiscal penalties imposed on him; save in the case of drug offences, any period of detention served on that account following conviction shall be deducted from the period of imprisonment in default ordered by the court and may not exceed the minimum period laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure for failure to comply with an order to pay a sum equal to the fiscal penalties imposed.\u201d\n30. As an exception to the general law, the customs authorities may, therefore, seek a court order under Article 388 of the Customs Code for the enforcement of an order for imprisonment on the ground of anticipatory default of payment of a customs fine.

Mahoney, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March and 3 July 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Names\n20. Under English law, a person is entitled to adopt such first names or surname as he or she wishes. Such names are valid for the purposes of identification and may be used in passports, driving licences, medical and insurance cards, etc. The new names are also entered on the electoral roll.\n#### B. Marriage and definition of gender in domestic law\n21. Under English law, marriage is defined as the voluntary union between a man and a woman. In the case of Corbett v. Corbett ([1971] Probate Reports 83), Mr Justice Ormrod ruled that sex for that purpose is to be determined by the application of chromosomal, gonadal and genital tests where these are congruent and without regard to any surgical intervention. This use of biological criteria to determine sex was approved by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Tan ([1983] Queen's Bench Reports 1053) and given more general application, the court holding that a person born male had been correctly convicted under a statute penalising men who live on the earnings of prostitution, notwithstanding the fact that the accused had undergone gender reassignment therapy.\n22. Under section 11(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, any marriage where the parties are not respectively male and female is void. The test applied as to the sex of the partners to a marriage is that laid down in the above-mentioned case of Corbett v. Corbett. According to that same decision a marriage between a male-to-female transsexual and a man might also be avoided on the basis that the transsexual was incapable of consummating the marriage in the context of ordinary and complete sexual intercourse (obiter per Mr Justice Ormrod).\nThis decision was reinforced by Section 12(a) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, according to which a marriage that has not been consummated owing to the incapacity of either party to consummate may be voidable. Section 13(1) of the Act provides that the court must not grant a decree of nullity if it is satisfied that the petitioner knew the marriage was voidable, but led the respondent to believe that she would not seek a decree of nullity, and that it would be unjust to grant the decree.\n#### C. Birth certificates\n23. Registration of births is governed by the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (\u201cthe 1953 Act\u201d). Section 1(1) of that Act requires that the birth of every child be registered by the Registrar of Births and Deaths for the area in which the child is born. An entry is regarded as a record of the facts at the time of birth. A birth certificate accordingly constitutes a document revealing not current identity but historical facts.\n24. The sex of the child must be entered on the birth certificate. The criteria for determining the sex of a child at birth are not defined in the Act. The practice of the Registrar is to use exclusively the biological criteria (chromosomal, gonadal and genital) as laid down by Mr Justice Ormrod in the above-mentioned case of Corbett v. Corbett.\n25. The 1953 Act provides for the correction by the Registrar of clerical errors or factual errors. The official position is that an amendment may only be made if the error occurred when the birth was registered. The fact that it may become evident later in a person's life that his or her \u201cpsychological\u201d sex is in conflict with the biological criteria is not considered to imply that the initial entry at birth was a factual error. Only in cases where the apparent and genital sex of a child was wrongly identified, or where the biological criteria were not congruent, can a change in the initial entry be made. It is necessary for that purpose to adduce medical evidence that the initial entry was incorrect. No error is accepted to exist in the birth entry of a person who undergoes medical and surgical treatment to enable that person to assume the role of the opposite sex.\n26. The Government point out that the use of a birth certificate for identification purposes is discouraged by the Registrar General, and for a number of years birth certificates have contained a warning that they are not evidence of the identity of the person presenting it. However, it is a matter for individuals whether to follow this recommendation.\n#### D. Social security, employment and pensions\n27. A transsexual continues to be recorded for social security, national insurance and employment purposes as being of the sex recorded at birth.\n##### 1. National Insurance\n28. The DSS registers every British citizen for National Insurance purposes (\u201cNI\u201d) on the basis of the information in their birth certificate. Non-British citizens who wish to register for NI in the United Kingdom may use their passport or identification card as evidence of identity if a birth certificate is unavailable.\n29. The DSS allocates every person registered for NI with a unique NI number. The NI number has a standard format consisting of two letters followed by three pairs of numbers and a further letter. It contains no indication in itself of the holder's sex or of any other personal information. The NI number is used to identify each person with a NI account (there are at present approximately 60 million individual NI accounts). The DSS are thereby able to record details of all NI contributions paid into the account during the NI account holder's life and to monitor each person's liabilities, contributions and entitlement to benefits accurately. New numbers may in exceptional cases be issued to persons e.g. under the witness protection schemes or to protect the identity of child offenders.\n30. Under Regulation 44 of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 1979, made under powers conferred by paragraph 8(1)(p) of Schedule 1 to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, specified individuals are placed under an obligation to apply for a NI number unless one has already been allocated to them.\n31. Under Regulation 45 of the 1979 Regulations, an employee is under an obligation to supply his NI number to his employer on request.\n32. Section 112(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 provides:\n\u201c(1) If a person for the purpose of obtaining any benefit or other payment under the legislation ...[as defined in section 110 of the Act]... whether for himself or some other person, or for any other purpose connected with that legislation -\n(a) makes a statement or representation which he knows to be false; or\n(b) produces or furnishes, or knowingly causes or knowingly allows to be produced or furnished, any document or information which he knows to be false in a material particular, he shall be guilty of an offence.\u201d\n33. It would therefore be an offence under this section for any person to make a false statement in order to obtain a NI number.\n34. Any person may adopt such first name, surname or style of address (e.g. Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms) that he or she wishes for the purposes of the name used for NI registration. The DSS will record any such amendments on the person's computer records, manual records and NI number card. But, the DSS operates a policy of only issuing one NI number for each person regardless of any changes that occur to that person's sexual identity through procedures such as gender re-assignment surgery. A renewed application for leave to apply for judicial review of the legality of this policy brought by a male-to-female transsexual was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Social Services ex parte Hooker (1993) (unreported). McCowan LJ giving the judgment of the Court stated (at page 3 of the transcript):\n\u201c...since it will not make the slightest practical difference, far from the Secretary of State's decision being an irrational one, I consider it a perfectly rational decision. I would further reject the suggestion that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that a new number would be given to her for psychological purpo", "001-60597": "\ufeff\nCASE OF G\u00d6\u00c7 v.

If necessary, he shall take oral evidence from the claimant. The appointed member shall transfer the case file to the office of the public prosecutor for his opinion after collecting all the evidence.\nUpon the receipt of the public prosecutor's written opinion, the court shall give its decision without holding a hearing.\nThe petitioner has the right to lodge an appeal against the court's decision within one week after he is notified of this decision.\u201d\n32.

B\u00eersan,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste, judges,\nand Mr M. O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 10 June and 9 July 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Taxes and tax surcharges\n30. The rules on taxes and tax surcharges relevant to the present case were primarily laid down in the Taxation Act (Taxeringslagen, 1990:324), the two Value-Added Tax Acts (Lagen om merv\u00e4rdeskatt, 1968:430, replaced by Merv\u00e4rdesskattelagen, 1994:200) and the Collection of Social Security Charges from Employers Act (Lagen om uppb\u00f6rd av socialavgifter fr\u00e5n arbetsgivare, 1984:688). Issues concerning taxation and the imposition of tax surcharges were regulated in a very similar manner in the various acts. In the following section, therefore, reference is made only to the provisions of the Taxation Act. The Collection of Social Security Charges from Employers Act and parts of the Value-Added Tax Act 1994 were replaced by the Tax Payment Act (Skattebetalningslagen, 1997:483) as from 1 November 1997. As no essential changes have been made by either the enactment of the Tax Payment Act or amendments to the Taxation Act, the following account describes both the present system and the one applicable at the material time.\n31. Income tax, value-added tax and employer's contributions are all determined by county tax authorities, to which taxpayers are obliged to submit information relevant to the assessment of taxes. For the purpose of securing timely, sufficient and correct information, there are provisions stipulating that, under certain circumstances, the tax authorities may impose penalties on the taxpayer in the form of tax surcharges.\n32. These surcharges were introduced into Swedish legislation in 1971. The new provisions entered into force on 1 January 1972 at the same time as a new Act on tax offences. According to the preparatory documents (Government Bill 1971:10), the main purpose of the reform was to create a more effective and fairer system of penalties than the old one, which was based entirely on criminal penalties determined by the ordinary courts following police investigation and prosecution. Unlike penalties for tax offences, the new surcharges were to be determined solely on objective grounds, and, accordingly, without regard to any form of criminal intent or negligence on the part of the taxpayer. It was thought that the old system did not function satisfactorily, since a large number of tax returns contained incorrect information whereas relatively few people were charged with tax offences. Now that the new system has been introduced only serious tax offences are prosecuted.\n33. A tax surcharge is imposed on a taxpayer in two situations: if he or she, in a tax return or in any other written statement, has submitted information of relevance to the tax assessment which is found to be incorrect (Chapter 5, section 1, of the Taxation Act) or if, following a discretionary assessment, the tax authority decides not to rely on the tax return (Chapter 5, section 2). It is not only express statements that may lead to the imposition of a surcharge; concealment, in whole or in part, of relevant facts may also be regarded as incorrect information. However, incorrect claims are not penalised; if the taxpayer has given a clear account of the factual circumstances but has made an incorrect evaluation of the legal consequences thereof, no surcharge is imposed. The burden of proving that the information is incorrect lies with the tax authority. A discretionary tax assessment is made if the taxpayer has submitted information which is so inadequate that the tax authority cannot base its tax assessment on it or if he or she has not filed a tax return despite having been reminded of the obligation to do so (Chapter 4, section 3). In the latter case the decision to impose a tax surcharge will be revoked if the taxpayer files a tax return within a certain time-limit. The surcharge amounts to 40% of either the income tax which the tax authority would have failed to levy if it had accepted the incorrect information or the income tax levied under the discretionary assessment. The corresponding provisions on value-added tax and employer's contributions stipulate that the surcharge comes to 20% of the supplementary tax levied on the taxpayer. In certain circumstances, the rates applied are 20% or 10%, respectively, for the various types of tax.\n34. Notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer has furnished incorrect information, no tax surcharge will be imposed in certain situations, for example where the tax authority has corrected obvious miscalculations or written errors by the taxpayer, where the information has been corrected or could have been corrected with the aid of certain documents that should have been available to the tax authorities, such as a certificate of income from the employer, or where the taxpayer has corrected the information voluntarily (Chapter 5, section 4).\n35. Moreover, in certain circumstances, a tax surcharge will be remitted. Thus, taxpayers will not have to pay a surcharge if their failure to submit correct information or to file a tax return is considered excusable owing to their age, illness, lack of experience or comparable circumstances. The surcharge should also be remitted where the failure appears excusable by reason of the nature of the information in question or other special circumstances, or where it would be manifestly unreasonable to impose a surcharge (Chapter 5, section 6). The phrase \u201cthe nature of the information\u201d primarily covers situations where a taxpayer has had to assess an objectively complicated tax question. According to the preparatory documents (Government Bill 1991/92:43, p. 88), the expression \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d refers to situations in which the imposition of a tax surcharge would be disproportionate to the fault attributable to the taxpayer or would be unacceptable for other reasons. If the facts of the case so require, the tax authorities must have regard to the provisions on remission, even in the absence of a specific claim to that effect by the taxpayer (Chapter 5, section 7). In principle, however, it is up to the taxpayer to show due cause for the remission of a surcharge.\n36. If dissatisfied with a decision concerning taxes and tax surcharges, the taxpayer may, before the end of the fifth year after the assessment year, request the tax authority to reconsider its decision (Chapter 4, sections 7 and 9). A decision concerning surcharges may also be reviewed at the taxpayer's request after the expiry of this time-limit, if the decision on the underlying tax issue has not yet become final (Chapter 4, section 11). The tax authority may also, on its own motion, decide to review its own earlier decision. A review to the taxpayer's disadvantage must be made before the end of the year following the assessment year unless the taxpayer, inter alia, has submitted incorrect information during the course of the tax proceedings or has failed to file a tax return or to furnish required information, in which case the time-limit normally expires at the end of the fifth year after the assessment year (Chapter 4, sections 7 and 14-19).\n37. The tax authority's decision may also be appealed against to a county administrative court. As with requests for reconsideration, an appeal has to be lodged before the end of the fifth year after the assessment year (Chapter 6, sections 1 and 3), unless it concerns a tax surcharge based on a tax decision that has not yet become final (Chapter 6, section 4). Following the appeal, the tax authority must reconsider its decision as soon as possible and, if it decides to vary the decision in accordance with the taxpayer's request, the appeal will become void (Chapter 6, section 6). If the decision is not thus amended, the appeal is referred to the county administrative court. If special reasons exist, an appeal may be forwarded by the tax authority to the county administrative court without reconsidering the assessment (Chapter 6, section 7). Further appeals lie to an administrative court of appeal and, subject to compliance with the conditions for obtaining leave to appeal, the Supreme Administrative Court.\n38. A tax surcharge is connected to the tax in respect of which it has been imposed in that a successful objection to the underlying tax has an automatic effect on the tax surcharge, which is reduced correspondingly (Chapter 5, section 11). The tax surcharge may, however, be challenged separately, if grounds for reduction or remission exist (see above).\n39. If the proceedings before a county administrative court or an administrative court of appeal concern a tax surcharge, the appellant has the right to an oral hearing (Chapter 6, section 24).\n#### B. Tax collection\n40. At the material time, the collection of taxes and tax surcharges was regulated by the Tax Collection Act, the Value-Added Tax Act 1994 and the Collection of Social Security Charges from Employers Act. The provisions of these Acts relevant to the present case were very similar and, for this reason, only the provisions of the Tax Collection Act", "001-60638": "\ufeff\nCASE OF MEFTAH AND OTHERS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Code of Criminal Procedure\n24. The relevant provisions, as worded at the material time, read as follows:\nArticle 567\n\u201cJudgments of indictment divisions and judgments of the criminal courts against which no ordinary appeal lies may, in the event of a breach of the law, be set aside on an appeal on points of law to the Court of Cassation lodged by the public prosecutor or by the party adversely affected, according to the distinctions made hereafter.\nThe appeal must be lodged with the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation.\u201d\nArticle 584\n\u201cAppellants in the Court of Cassation may lodge a pleading bearing their signature and containing the grounds of their appeal with the registry of the court against whose judgment they are appealing either when giving notice of appeal or within the following ten days. The registrar shall issue them with a receipt.\u201d\nArticle 585\n\u201cAfter the expiry of that time-limit, convicted appellants may send their pleading directly to the Court of Cassation; the other parties may not avail themselves of this provision without being represented by a member of the Court of Cassation Bar. ...\u201d\nArticle 585-1\n\u201cSave where the President of the Criminal Division decides otherwise, convicted appellants shall lodge their pleading with the registry of the Court of Cassation no later than one month from the date of the notice of appeal.\nThe same rule shall apply to notices of acting lodged by lawyers representing an appellant in the Court of Cassation.\u201d\nArticle 590\n\u201cThe pleadings shall contain the grounds of appeal and cite the legal provisions that are alleged to have been infringed. ...\nThey must be lodged within the prescribed time-limit. No further pleadings may be added to them once the reporting judge has filed his report. Any pleading setting out additional grounds that is lodged out of time may be declared inadmissible.\u201d\nArticle 602\n\u201cThe reports shall be presented at the hearing. The parties' lawyers shall make their observations after the report, if appropriate. The public prosecutor shall make his or her submissions.\u201d\n#### B. Submissions of the advocate-general\n25. Current practice is for the advocate-general to inform the parties' lawyers before the day of the hearing of the tenor of his or her submissions and in cases where, at the request of the lawyers, there is an oral hearing, they are entitled to reply to his or her submissions orally or by a note sent to the court in deliberations (see Reinhardt and Slimane-Ka\u00efd v. France, judgment of 31 March 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 666, \u00a7 106).\n#### C. Appearance at the hearing before the Court of Cassation\n26. In cases in which representation by a member of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar is not compulsory, an ordinance of 15 January 1826, Article 15 of which has not been repealed, lays down that the parties may make oral representations with the permission of the Court of Cassation. On the basis of the ordinance of 1826 the Court of Cassation accepts that it is possible for it to give the parties leave to address it, or for a member of the ordinary bar to speak on their behalf. Although it is for the Court of Cassation to decide whether or not to grant permission according to the circumstances (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 3 May 1990, Bull. crim. [Criminal Bulletin] no. 166), it appears that its practice is to refuse such applications (see the period 1990 to 2001 and the judgments available on the L\u00e9gifrance Internet site) in terms similar to the following:\n\u201cRegard being had to Article 37 of the Ordinance of 15 January 1826, which has not been repealed in so far as it concerns the procedure applicable before the Criminal Division; as [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be either necessary or appropriate; it is not necessary to order it.\u201d (judgment of 15 December 1999, appeal on points of law no. 99-80015)\n27. As regards more particularly cases involving road-traffic offences (such as parking or speeding offences), there have been numerous decisions in which applications made by members of the ordinary bar have been turned down, the Court of Cassation holding as in the following decision:\n\u201c[The appellant] has requested permission to appear before the Court of Cassation assisted by Mr [...], a member of the Paris Bar [...]. As [the appellant] has set out his grounds of appeal against the impugned decision in a pleading which he has lodged in person, his appearance in person before the Criminal Division does not appear to be essential.\u201d (judgment of 16 May 2001, appeal on points of law no. 00\u201186011)\n28. Indeed, the Government acknowledge that such permission is rarely granted, the principle being that the members of the Conseil d'Etat and Court of Cassation Bar have a monopoly on making oral representations. They must consult the President of the Criminal Division beforehand regarding the ground of appeal on points of law for which they consider oral representations to be necessary. In 2001 oral representations were only made in some 40 or so appeals out of a total of 9,637 that were heard.\n#### D.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n26. Section 1 of the Wages Councils Act 1979 provided for the establishment of wages councils by order of the Secretary of State for Employment in respect of those workers described in the order and their employers. Under section 14, wages councils were empowered, inter alia, to fix the rate of remuneration for any workers in relation to which they operated. Under section 15, contracts of employment providing for payment of less than the minimum remuneration prescribed by a wages council would have effect as if the contractual rate were superseded by the statutory minimum rate. A wages council was established for workers in licensed residential establishments and licensed restaurants. Minimum remuneration for those workers was laid down in the Wages (Licensed Residential Establishment and Licensed Restaurant) Order 1982. Paragraph 3 of the 1982 Order specified the minimum rate to be paid for forty hours\u2019 work as well as the rates for overtime, night work, etc. Paragraph 12 of the 1982 Order provided that if in any week in which a worker performed some work for his employer the total amount of gratuities from customers received by the worker was less that 8.40 pounds sterling (GBP), the employer had to pay the worker such sum as the amount of gratuities fell short of GBP 8.40. There had to be a written agreement between the worker and the employer to this effect. Where such an agreement existed, the worker had to be paid the appropriate amount reduced by twenty-one pence per hour for the first forty hours worked by him in any week.\n27. Section 17 of the Wages Councils Act 1979 defined remuneration as the amount obtained or to be obtained in cash by the worker from his employer after allowing for the worker\u2019s necessary expenditure, if any, in connection with his employment.\n28. The definition of remuneration under section 17 of the Wages Act 1986 also took as its starting-point the total amount of any money payments made by the employer to the worker.

A transfer under section 47 of the 1983 Act is called a \u201ctransfer direction\u201d, and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under section 37 (1) of the 1983 Act (that is, where a court convicts a person and, instead of sentencing him, orders his detention in hospital).\n20.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 3, 8 AND 10 OF THE CONVENTION, ALONE AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 14, AND OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n45. The applicants complained about both the intrusive investigations into their private lives and about their subsequent discharges from the armed forces pursuant to the absolute policy of the Ministry of Defence against homosexuals in the armed forces. They invoked Article 8, both alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.\n46. They also considered that they were treated in a manner inconsistent with Article 3, either taken alone or in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. They referred both to the intrusive investigations into their private lives and to their being singled out for investigation and discharge because of their homosexuality.\n47. The applicants further complained about the decision to adopt and apply the policy against homosexuals in the armed forces, about the investigations conducted and about their having been discharged because of their homosexuality, invoking Article 10, both alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention.\n48. Finally, the applicants invoked Article 13 of the Convention, arguing that they had no effective domestic remedy in relation to the above violations of the Convention.\n49. The relevant Articles of the Convention read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\nArticle 3:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\nArticle 8:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life, ...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety...\u201d\nArticle 10:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, ...\u201d\nArticle 13:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority ...\u201d\nArticle 14:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n50. By their letter to the Court dated 14 January 2000 the Government stated that they did not believe that the Court\u2019s consideration of the present cases should lead to conclusions on the substantive issues different from those reached in the above-cited cases of Lustig-Prean and Beckett and Smith and Grady. By their letter to the Court dated 18 February 2000 the applicants confirmed that they agreed with the Government on this point.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Article 8 of the Convention, alone and in conjunction with Article 14\n51. The Court recalls that in its judgments in the above-cited cases of Lustig-Prean and Beckett (\u00a7\u00a7 63-68 and 80-105) and Smith and Grady (\u00a7\u00a7 70-75 and 87-112) it found that the investigation of the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation, and their discharge from the armed forces on the grounds of their homosexuality pursuant to the absolute policy of the Ministry of Defence against the presence of homosexuals in the armed forces, constituted direct interferences with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private lives which could not be justified under the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention as being \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d. A violation of Article 8 was therefore found.\n52.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nThe Home Office Guidelines\n23. Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations (The Home Office Guidelines of 1984) provide that only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines are available in the library of the House of Commons and are disclosed by the Home Office on application. They provide, inter alia:\n\u201c4. In each case, the authorising officer should satisfy himself that the following criteria are met:\nthe investigation concerns serious crime;\nnormal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, or must from the nature of things, be unlikely to succeed if tried;\nthere must be good reason to think that use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism;\nuse of equipment must be operationally feasible.\n5. In judging how far the seriousness of the crime under investigation justifies the use of a particular surveillance technique, authorising officers should satisfy themselves that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.\u201d\n24. The Guidelines also state that there may be circumstances in which material so obtained could appropriately be used in evidence at subsequent court proceedings.\nThe Police Act 1997\n25. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, came into force on 22 February 1998.\n26. Since 25 September 2000 these controls have been augmented by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). In particular, covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections 26(3) and 48(1) of RIPA. RIPA also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police.\nThe Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984\n27. Section 76 provides:\n\u201c(1) In any proceedings a confession made by an accused person may be given in evidence against him in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of this section.\n(2) If in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained \u2013\n(a) by oppression of the person who made it; or\n(b) in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession that might be made by him in consequence thereof,\nthe court shall not allow the confession to be given in eviden", "001-60717": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LISIAK v.

Disability benefits\n20. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1987 and 1996, when the applicant made his applications to the Office, this corresponded to 6,868 and 10,317 Swedish kronor (SEK), respectively.\n#### B. Procedure\n21. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Appeals may be made against the Office\u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act.\n22.

Appointment of defence counsel\n29. The suspect may conduct the defence on his or her own (section 1) or with the assistance of a defence counsel (section 3) who, as a main rule, is appointed by the suspect (section 3, subsection 2). A defence counsel so appointed is referred to as private defence counsel, as opposed to one appointed by a court who is referred to as public defence counsel.\n30. Public defence counsel is to be appointed for a person who is arrested or in detention, if he or she so requests. Upon request, such counsel will also be appointed for a person suspected of an offence for which the statutory penalty is imprisonment for at least six months (section 3 a, subsection 1). In addition, public defence counsel must be appointed under either of the following circumstances: (1) if the suspect is in need of counsel due to the criminal investigation, (2) if there is such a need on account of it being uncertain which penalty will be imposed and there is reason to impose a penalty other than a fine or a conditional sentence or a combination of those penalties, or (3) there are other special reasons relating to the suspect\u2019s personal situation or the subject matter of the case (section 3 a, subsection 2). However, if the suspect has already appointed defence counsel, no additional public counsel is to be appointed (section 3 a, subsection 3).\n31.

The relevant powers of the Council\n35. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) came into force on 3 February 1995. The relevant parts of section 163 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. Without prejudice to any power which they may appear to exercise for those purposes under any other enactment, a local authority may take such of the following steps as they consider will, in relation to their area, promote the prevention of crime or the welfare of the victims of crime \u2013\n(a) providing apparatus for recording visual images of events occurring on any land in their area;\n(b) providing within their area a telecommunications system which, under Part II of the Telecommunications Act 1984, may be run without a licence;\n(c) arranging for the provision of any other description of telecommunications system within their area or between any land in their area and any building occupied by a public authority.\n2. Any power to provide, or to arrange for the provision of, any apparatus includes power to maintain, or operate, or, as the case may be, to arrange for the maintenance or operation of, that apparatus.\u201d\n36. The relevant part of section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 provides as follows:\n\u201cWithout prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but subject to the provisions of this Act and any other enactment passed before or after this Act, a local authority shall have the power to do anything ... which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to the discharge of any of their functions.\u201d\n37. Essex Police Policy Guidelines dated June 1995 concern the involvement of the police in the installation and operation of CCTV systems in their remit. In the section concerning the release to the media of video footage, it was pointed out that care should be taken not to jeopardise any existing or future legal proceedings, that licence agreements covering all appropriate terms and conditions of release should be drawn up and that care should always be taken to ensure that victims or other innocent parties featured were aware of its potential use and, where possible, their consent obtained. Where possible, the identity of victims, police employees and suspects (where identification might jeopardise criminal proceedings) should be masked.\n38. As an extension of the Crime Reduction Programme announced in July 1998, government funding for CCTV systems was introduced in March 1999 and the sum of 153 million pounds sterling (GBP) has been made available over a period of three years, of which over GBP 40 million has already been allocated to more than 200 CCTV schemes. One of the requirements of such funding is that the scheme should be regulated by a suitable code of practice to ensure that it operates fairly and with proper respect for personal privacy. In the first year of operation of the CCTV system in Brentwood, there was a 34% reduction in crime.\n#### B. Judicial review\n39. Where a public authority has exceeded its powers or has acted irrationally or has reached a decision in breach of the rules of procedural fairness, then a person aggrieved may challenge the decision by means of a judicial review. If a decision is so disproportionate to its intended objective as to be irrational, the Court will strike it down. The English courts do not recognise proportionality as a separate head of judicial review. However, in the case of R. (Alconbury Developments Ltd) v. Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions ([2001] 2 Weekly Law Reports 1389), Lord Slynn of the House of Lords stated obiter dictum:\n\u201cI consider that even without reference to the Human Rights Act 1998 the time has come to recognise that this principle [of proportionality] is part of English administrative law, not only when judges are dealing with Community acts but also when they are dealing with acts subject to domestic law.\u201d\n#### C. Private-law remedies\n40. The remedy of breach of confidence is made up of three essential elements: the information itself must have \u201cthe necessary quality of confidence about it\u201d; the information \u201cmust have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence\u201d; and there must have been an \u201cunauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it\u201d (Coco v. A.N. Clark Engineers Ltd [1969] Reports of Patent Cases 41, at p. 47). A fuller description of this cause of action together with more recent domestic case-law are detailed in Earl and Countess Spencer v. the United Kingdom (applications nos. 28851/95 and 28852/95, Commission decision of 16 January 1998, Decisions and Reports (DR) 92\u2011A, p. 56).\n41. Where a public official abuses his position by performing an administrative act maliciously, or which he knows he has no power to do, and causes foreseeable harm, then the injured person may recover damages on the basis of misfeasance in public office.\n42. The remedy of defamation is well established in English law. Every person is entitled to his good name and to the esteem in which he is held by others and has a right to claim that his reputation shall not be disparaged by defamatory statements made about him to a third person or persons without lawful justification or excuse.\n43. The essential elements of malicious falsehood are that a defendant has published words about the claimant that are false, that they were published maliciously and that special damage has followed as a direct and natural result of their publication (Kaye v. Robertson [1991] Fleet Street Reports 62).\n44. The tort of nuisance consists of an unwarranted interference with the use or enjoyment of land (see, for example, Thomas v. National Union of Mineworkers [1986] Law Reports: Chancery Division 20). Trespass consists of an unjustifiable intrusion by one person upon the land in the possession of another. The domestic courts have been developing the concept of a tort of harassment causing personal injury (see, for example, Burnett v. George [1992] 1 Family Law Reports 525, and Khorasandjin v. Bush [1993] 3 All England Law Reports 669).\n45. Depending on the circumstances in which any film has been made or published, the unauthorised taking or publication of pictures might be prevented (or damages recovered) on the grounds of copyright, breach of contract or inducing breach of contract.\n#### D. Statutory protection for privacy\n46. Statute law provides certain protection in the form of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Statutory regulation of surveillance is provided by the Interception of Communications Act 1985, by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and by the", "001-60911": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF KUBISZYN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n24. Under the Norwegian jury system, when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion, and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant's guilt was not unanimous. The criminal system knows only two conclusions in a criminal case \u2013 guilt or acquittal (see Articles 365, 366, 372 and 373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). There is no third alternative, which was known in some other European countries, where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence for establishing guilt.\n25. Articles 444 to 446 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide for compensation where a person has been acquitted, or the prosecution discontinued. The provisions read as follows:\n\u201cArticle 444: If a person charged is acquitted or the prosecution against him is discontinued, he may claim compensation from the State for any damage that he has suffered through the prosecution if it is shown to be probable that he did not carry out the act that formed the basis for the charge. If a sentence of imprisonment or other custodial sanction has already been served, any damage resulting from this shall be compensated without regard to what has been shown to be probable.\nCompensation shall not be awarded when the person charged, by making a confession or otherwise, has wilfully instigated the prosecution or the conviction.\nIf he has otherwise contributed to the damage by negligence, the compensation may be reduced or dispensed with entirely.\nArticle 445: Even if the conditions prescribed in Article 444 are not fulfilled, the court may award the person charged compensation for special or disproportionate damage as a consequence of the criminal prosecution whenever this appears to be reasonable in the circumstances.\nArticle 446: If the conditions relating to compensation prescribed in Articles 444 or 445 are fulfilled, the court may, when special reasons so indicate, award the person charged a suitable amount as redress for the indignity or other damage of a non\u2011economic nature that he has suffered as a result of the prosecution.\u201d\n26. In addition, there are certain formal conditions set out in Article 447 for the submission and examination of a compensation claim made under Articles 444 to 446:\n\u201cAny claim for compensation or redress must be submitted not later than three months after the person charged has been informed of the decision that finally concludes the case. The provisions of Article 318, first paragraph, shall apply correspondingly.\nIf the case has been concluded without any judicial trial of the evidence relating to the issue of guilt, the claim shall be submitted to a court of summary jurisdiction.\nOtherwise the claim shall be submitted to the court that shall conduct or has last condu", "001-60933": "\ufeff\nFORMER THIRD SECTION\nCASE OF RINGVOLD v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n20. Under Norwegian criminal law there are four basic conditions that must be met in order to establish criminal liability:\n(1) the accused has committed an act or omission (actus reus) which is contrary to a provision of the Criminal Code or to a special statutory criminal provision in force at the time when the act or omission occurred;\n(2) there are no exonerating circumstances (for example, self-defence);\n(3) the accused has acted with intent (mens rea), unless otherwise expressly stated in the relevant criminal provision; and\n(4) the accused was of sound mind at the time of the commission of the offence.\n21. As a general rule, the prosecution has to prove these four elements beyond reasonable doubt. Any reasonable doubt must benefit the accused (in dubio pro reo).\n22. Under the Norwegian jury system, when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion, and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant\u2019s guilt was not unanimous. Only two conclusions are possible in a criminal case \u2013 guilt or acquittal (see Articles 365, 366, 372 and 373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). There is no third alternative, such as that formerly known in some other European countries, where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence to establish guilt.\n23. Under the 1981 Code of Criminal Procedure, a civil claim may be pursued in connection with a criminal trial, provided that the claim arises from the same set of facts. The civil claim of a victim may be decided either in connection with a criminal case or in separate proceedings. Article 3 reads:\n\u201cAny legal claim that the aggrieved person or any other injured person has against the person charged may, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 29, be pursued in connection with such cases as are mentioned in Article 1 or Article 2, provided that the said claim arises from the same act that the case is concerned with. On the above conditions the following claims may also be pursued:\n...\nThe claims specified in the first and second paragraphs shall be deemed to be civil claims and shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 29 ...\u201d\nOther provisions concerning civil compensation claims may be found in Chapter 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, notably the following:\nArticle 427\n\u201cIn a public prosecution the prosecuting authority may on application pursue such civil legal clai", "001-60939": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF BERTUZZI v.

The object of such a return is that, following the restoration of the status quo, the conflict between the custodian and the person who has removed or retained the child can be resolved in the State where the child is habitually resident. This principle is based on the consideration that the courts of the State of habitual residence are usually best placed to take custody decisions.\nArticle 3\n\u201cThe removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where\n(a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or the retention; and\n(b) at the time of the removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention. ...\u201d\nArticle 7\n\u201cCentral Authorities shall co-operate with each other and promote co-operation amongst the competent authorities in their respective States to secure the prompt return of children and to achieve the other objects of this Convention.\nIn particular, either directly or through any intermediary, they shall take all appropriate measures\n(a) To discover the whereabouts of a child who has been wrongfully removed or retained;\n(b) To prevent further harm to the child or prejudice to interested parties by taking or causing to be taken provisional measures;\n(c) To secure the voluntary return of the child or to bring about an amicable resolution of the issues;\n(d) To exchange, where desirable, information relating to the social background of the child;\n(e) To provide information of a general character as to the law of their State in connection with the application of the Convention;\n(f) To initiate or facilitate the institution of judicial or administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining the return of the child and, in a proper case, to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access;\n(g) Where the circumstances so require, to provide or facilitate the provision of legal aid and advice, including the participation of legal counsel and advisers;\n(h) To provide such administrative arrangements as may be necessary and appropriate to secure the safe return of the child;\n(i) To keep each other informed with respect to the operation of this Convention and, as far as possible, to eliminate any obstacles to its application.\u201d\nArticle 11\n\u201cThe judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.\nIf the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay ...\u201d\nArticle 12\n\u201cWhere a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 ..., the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.\u201d\nArticle 13\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person,", "001-61069": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF IGLESIAS GIL AND A.U.I. v.

At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person\u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness.\n23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right:\n\u201cOf more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law.\nThe case of Harrison v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n38. The applicant complained about the alleged unfairness of German court proceedings concerning her claims for reimbursement of medical expenses against a private health insurance company. She relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. Arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The applicant\n39. The applicant maintained that the German courts had arbitrarily interpreted the notion of \u201cnecessary medical treatment\u201d in a narrow sense. In her view, the expert had recommended her operation without hesitation. However, the Court of Appeal in particular had transposed general views on transsexuality in the medical opinion of Dr H. and had required the operation to be the only possible treatment.\n40. She also considered that the Court of Appeal should not have drawn conclusions from a written expert opinion prepared in the context of a previous set of court proceedings without hearing the expert Dr O. She had only agreed to the consultation of these files in order to avoid repeated taking of evidence on her sexual orientation. The experts had never situated the biographical information concerned in the context of the question whether she had herself deliberately caused her transsexuality. Moreover, in her expert opinion, Dr O. had only stated that the applicant\u2019s infertility had contributed to its development. The Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion, without an expert medical report, that her hormone treatment had brought about her transsexuality was arbitrary.\n##### 2. The Government\n41. According to the Government, the proceedings as a whole had been fair. In their view, the applicant had had the opportunity to put forward all relevant arguments and to adduce evidence. Moreover, the Berlin Regional Court had taken evidence on the question whether the operation was a necessary medical treatment and had duly taken the conclusions of the expert Dr H. into account. Likewise, the Court of Appeal had fully considered the expert medical opinion and, at an oral hearing, it had given the applicant a further opportunity to comment on the matter.\n42. The German courts\u2019 interpretation of the insurance contract between the applicant and the health insurance company, and in particular of the necessity of the gender reassignment surgery as medical treatment, could not be objected to under the Convention. The burden of proof had been on the applicant as the insured person. The expert had not unequivocally affirmed the medical necessity of an operation, but had recommended the operation from a psychiatric-psychotherapeutic point of view. The Court of Appeal had concluded therefrom that the operation was not necessary as a medical treatment, even though the applicant\u2019s social situation could be improved. The courts also had regard to the proceedings concerning the change of the applicant\u2019s forenames.\n43. Furthermore, as the written expert opinion had been conclusive, the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal had not been obliged to summon the expert.\n44. Moreover, the Court of Appeal, taking into account the defendant\u2019s submissions, had to take evidence on the question whether the applicant had herself deliberately caused the disease. The court had assessed this matter on the basis of an expert opinion, prepared by Dr O. in the context of the proceedings before the Sch\u00f6neberg District Court concerning the change of forenames. In the first-instance proceedings, the applicant had agreed that these files be consulted.\n45. According to the Government, this expert opinion contained sufficient elements concerning, inter alia, her early youth, her military service and her marriage to support the conclusion that the applicant had herself deliberately caused her transsexuality. In this respect, the Court of Appeal had correctly noted that the applicant had started hormone medication without first consulting a medical practitioner.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. The Court\u2019s general approach\n46. The Court reiterates that it is in the first place for the national authorities, and notably the courts, to interpret domestic law and that it will not substitute its own interpretation for theirs in the absence of arbitrariness (see, mutatis mutandis, Ravnsborg v. Sweden, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283-B, pp. 29-30, \u00a7 33; Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 355-56, \u00a7 29; and Tejedor Garc\u00eda v. Spain, judgment of 16 December 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2796, \u00a7 31).\n47.

Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr M. Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr J. Borrego Borrego, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 June 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n32. Domestic provisions of relevance in the present case are found in the Joint Ownership Act (\u201cthe 1904 Act\u201d), the Administration of Certain Jointly Owned Agricultural Property Act (Lagen om f\u00f6rvaltning av vissa sam\u00e4gda jordbruksfastigheter, 1989:31 \u2013 \u201cthe 1989 Act\u201d), the Real Estate Formation Act (Fastighetsbildningslagen, 1970:988 \u2013 \u201cthe 1970 Act\u201d), the Enforcement Code and the Code of Judicial Procedure (R\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken).\n#### A. Joint ownership\n33. At the time of the building of the house in issue, the ownership of Marum 1:6 and 1:8 was governed by the 1904 Act. Section 2 provided that a joint owner wishing to dispose of real estate must have the consent of all the other joint owners. According to the Supreme Court case-law, a joint owner who was of the opinion that another joint owner had acted in a way which conflicted with section 2 \u2013 that is had not had the necessary consent \u2013 could challenge the action in court (Nytt juridiskt arkiv (\u201cNJA\u201d) 1990, p. 184; the same right to bring proceedings is afforded to a joint owner under the 1989 Act \u2013 see NJA 1992, p. 769). Under section 3, a joint owner who disagreed with the administration or use of real estate could request the court to appoint an administrator. Further, under section 6, a joint owner had the right to apply for a sale of real estate at public auction. The only way for another joint owner to prevent such a sale was to request division proceedings in accordance with section 7. If such proceedings had been started, the court could not decide on the question of a sale until the division proceedings had been concluded.\n34. As the real estate in the present case is assessed, for tax purposes, as agricultural property, the provisions of the 1989 Act are applicable as from 1 July 1989. The relevant provisions of that Act are essentially the same as in the 1904 Act. Thus, section 5(2) of the 1989 Act contains a rule that corresponds to section 2 of the 1904 Act.\n#### B. Real estate formation\n35. Under Chapter 11, section 1, of the 1970 Act, jointly owned real estate may, on application by a joint owner to the Real Estate Formation Authority (\u201cthe REFA\u201d), be divided into individual plots, provided that each plot created is deemed permanently suitable for its purpose in accordance with Chapter 3, section 1. Chapter 11, section 3(4), provides that if a court has ordered real estate to be offered for sale at a public auction, the estate may be divided only if no sale has taken place.\n#### C. Procedure and enforcement\n36. The enforcement rules are laid down in the Enforcement Code. According to Chapter 3, sections 1 and 3, a court judgment may be enforced as soon as it has acquired legal force. Section 21 of the same chapter deals with objections against enforcement. Such objections may only be raised in respect of circumstances that have occurred after the delivery of the enforceable judgment, and the Enforcement Office is accordingly not entitled to reconsider the judgment itself.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 June 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial. The duty also extends to statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence.\n28. In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common-law duty to disclose to the defence certain evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Criminal Appeal Reports 302 \u2013 \u201cthe Guidelines\u201d). According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was \u201csensitive\u201d material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. \u201cSensitive material\u201d was defined as follows:\n\u201c... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier \u2013 e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.\u201d\n29. Subsequent to the applicant\u2019s trial in 1989 but before the appeal proceedings in March 1994, the Guidelines were superseded by the common law.\n30. In R. v. Ward ([1993] 1 Weekly Law Reports 619), the Court of Appeal dealt with the duty of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defence and the proper procedure to be followed when the prosecution claimed public interest immunity.

Ugrekhelidze,\nMrs A. Mularoni,\nand also of Mr P.J. Mahoney, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 November 2002 and 11 June 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n#### A. Family legislation currently in force\n30. The statutory provisions on custody and access are to be found in the German Civil Code. They have been amended on several occasions and many were repealed following the adoption of new family legislation (Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht) on 16 December 1997 (Federal Gazette 1997, p. 2942), which came into force on 1 July 1998.\n31. Article 1626 \u00a7 1 reads as follows:\n\u201cThe father and the mother have the right and the duty to exercise parental authority [elterliche Sorge] over a minor child. The parental authority includes the custody [Personensorge] and the care of property [Verm\u00f6genssorge] of the child.\u201d\n32. Pursuant to Article 1626 a \u00a7 1, as amended, the parents of a minor child born out of wedlock jointly exercise custody if they make a declaration to that effect (declaration on joint custody) or if they marry. According to Article 1684, as amended, a child is entitled to have access to both parents; each parent is obliged to have contact with, and entitled to have access to, the child. Moreover, the parents must not do anything that would harm the child's relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child's upbringing. The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise, also with regard to third parties; they may also order the parties to fulfil their obligations towards the child. The family courts can, however, restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child's welfare. A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if the child's well-being would otherwise be endangered. The family courts may order that the right of access be exercised in the presence of a third party, such as a Youth Office authority or an association.\n#### B. Family legislation in force at the material time\n33. Before the entry into force of the new family legislation, the relevant provision of the Civil Code concerning custody and access for a child born in wedlock was worded as follows:\nArticle 1634\n\u201c1. A parent not having custody has the right to personal contact with the child. The parent not having custody and the person having custody must not do anything that would harm the child's relationship with others or seriously interfere with the child's upbringing.\n2. The family court can determine the scope of that right and can prescribe more specific rules for its exercise, also with regard to third parties; as long as no decision is made, the right, under Article 1632 \u00a7 2, of the parent not having custody may be exercised throughout the period of contact. The family court can restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child's welfare.\n3. A parent not having custody who has a legitimate interest in obtaining information about the child's personal circumstances may request such information from the person having custody in so far as this is in keeping with the child's interests. The guardianship court shall rule on any dispute over the right to information.\n4. Where both parents have custody and are separated not merely temporarily, the foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis.\u201d\nArticle 1632 \u00a7 2 concerned the right to determine third persons' rights of access to the child.\n34. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code concerning custody of and access to a child born out of wedlock were worded as follows:\nArticle 1705\n\u201cCustody over a minor child born out of wedlock is exercised by the child's mother ...\u201d\nArticle 1711\n\u201c1. The person having custody of the child shall determine the father's right of access to the child. Article 1634 \u00a7 1, second sentence, applies by analogy.\n2. If it is in the child's interests to have personal contact with the father, the guardianship court can decide that the father has a right to personal contact. Article 1634 \u00a7 2 applies by analogy. The guardianship court can change its decision at any time.\n3. The right to request information about the child's personal circumstances is set out in Article 1634 \u00a7 3.\n4. Where appropriate, the Youth Office shall mediate between the father and the person who exercises the right of custody.\u201d\n#### C. The Non-Contentious Proceedings Act\n35. Like proceedings in other family matters, proceedings under former Article 1711 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code were governed by the Non-Contentious Proceedings Act (Gesetz \u00fcber die Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit).\n36. According to section 12 of that Act, the court shall, of its own motion, take the measures of investigation that are necessary to establish the relevant facts and take the evidence that appears appropriate.\n37. In proceedings regarding access, the competent Youth Office has to be heard prior to the decision (section 49(1)(k)).\n38. As regards the hearing of parents in custody proceedings, section 50a(1) stipulates that the court shall hear the parents in proceedings concerning custody or the administration of the child's assets. In matters relating to custody, the court shall, as a rule, hear the parents personally. In cases concerning placement into public care, the parents shall always be heard. According to section 50a(2), a parent not having custody shall be heard except where it appears that such a hearing would not contribute to the clarification of the matter.\n#### D.

Guidelines on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations (the Home Office Guidelines of 1984) provide that only chief constables or assistant chief constables are entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines are available in the library of the House of Commons and are disclosed by the Home Office on application.\n24. In each case, the authorising officer should satisfy himself that the following criteria are met: (a) the investigation concerns serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation must have been tried and failed, or must from the nature of things, be unlikely to succeed if tried; (c) there must be good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism and (d) the use of equipment must be operationally feasible. The authorising officer should also satisfy himself that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by the surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.\n#### B. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (\u201cPACE\u201d)\n25. Section 78(1) of PACE provides as follows:\n\u201cIn any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\u201d\n26.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 1 July 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Entrapment under English law\n28. The fact that a defendant would not have committed an offence were it not for the activity of an undercover police officer or an informer acting on police instructions does not provide a defence under English law. The judge does, however, have a discretion to order a stay of a prosecution where it appears that entrapment has occurred, as the House of Lords affirmed in R. v. Looseley; Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 2000) ([2001] UKHL 53), a judgment which followed and approved earlier case-law, including case-law which applied at the times of the applicants' trials (for example, the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Latif [1996] vol. 1 Weekly Law reports p. 104).\nIn Looseley, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead explained, (\u00a7 1):\n\u201cMy Lords, every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent abuse of its process. This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. By recourse to this principle courts ensure that executive agents of the state do not misuse the coercive, law enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens of the state. Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur. It is simply not acceptable that the state through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would be a misuse of state power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. The unattractive consequences, frightening and sinister in extreme cases, which state conduct of this nature could have are obvious. The role of the courts is to stand between the state and its citizens and make sure this does not happen\u201d.\n29. In addition, the court has a discretion, under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to exclude evidence obtained by an undercover police officer where, inter alia, the defendant would not have committed the offence without the police incitement (R. v. Smurthwaite; R. v. Gill (1994) vol. 98 Criminal Appeal Reports p. 437, judgment of the Court of Appeal; and Looseley, cited above). Of the two remedies, the grant of a stay, rather than the exclusion of evidence, is the more appropriate remedy because a prosecution founded on entrapment is an abuse of the court's process and should not have been brought in the first place.\n30. In Looseley, their Lordships agreed that it was not possible to set out a comprehensive definition of unacceptable police conduct or \u201cstate created crime\u201d. In each case it was for the judge, having regard to all the circumstances, to decide whether the conduct of the police or other law enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into dispute. Factors to be taken into account included the nature of the offence, the reason for the particular police operation, the possibility of using other methods of detection and the nature and extent of police participation in the crime; the greater the inducement held out by the police, and the more forceful and persistent the police overtures, the more readily might a court conclude that the", "001-61253": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF PRICE and LOWE v.

Section 14 of the Rent Act (Mietrechtsgesetz) reads as follows:\n\u201cRight to a tenancy in the event of death\n(1) The death of the landlord or a tenant shall not terminate a tenancy.\n(2) On the death of the main tenant of a flat, the persons designated in subsection (3) as being entitled to succeed to the tenancy shall do so, to the exclusion of other persons entitled to succeed to the estate, unless they have notified the landlord within fourteen days of the main tenant's death that they do not wish to continue the tenancy. On succeeding to the tenancy, the new tenants shall assume liability for the rent and any obligations that arose during the tenancy of the deceased main tenant. If more than one person is entitled to succeed, they shall succeed jointly to the tenancy and become jointly and severally liable.\n(3) The following shall be entitled to succeed to the tenancy for the purposes of subsection (2): a spouse, a life companion, relatives in the direct line including adopted children, and siblings of the former tenant, in so far as such persons have a pressing need for accommodation and have already lived in the accommodation with the tenant as members of the same household. For the purposes of this provision, 'life companion' shall mean a person who has lived in the flat with the former tenant until the latter's death for at least three years, sharing a household on an economic footing like that of a marriage; a life companion shall be deemed to have lived in the flat for three years if he or she moved into the flat together with the former tenant at the outset.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

Mahoney, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 1 October and on 3 December 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. General\n15. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended, inter alia, the Air Force Act 1955 (references below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to that Act as amended). Trial by court-martial in the RAF is regulated, inter alia, by the 1955 Act, the Courts-Martial (Air Force) Rules 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Rules\u201d) and the Queen's Regulations for the RAF.\n16. Section 70(1) of the 1955 Act provides that any person subject to air-force law who commits a civilian offence, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, shall be guilty of an offence against that section.\n17. Section 71(1) of the 1955 Act lists the punishments available to a court-martial following conviction and establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of each punishment in the hierarchy of punishments available (the \u201ccoda\u201d to section 71(1) of the 1955 Act).\n18. The powers of punishment of courts-martial (general and district) are set out in section 85 of the 1955 Act:\n\u201c(1) A general court-martial shall have power to try any person subject to air force law for any offence which under this Act is triable by court-martial, and to award for any such offence any punishment authorised by this Act for that offence.\n(2) A district court-martial shall have the powers of a general court-martial except that it shall not try an officer or sentence a warrant officer to imprisonment, discharge with disgrace, dismissal or detention, and shall not award the punishment of death or of imprisonment for a term exceeding two years or make an order committing a person to be detained under section 71AA of this Act for a period exceeding two years.\u201d\n19. A person guilty of theft is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine or both (section 7 of the Theft Act 1968).\n#### B. The court-martial \u2013 participants and procedure\n##### 1. The commanding officer (CO)\n20. An allegation that a person subject to air-force law has committed an offence must be reported to the CO of the accused. The CO must investigate the charge, after which he may refer the matter to the higher authority (section 76(5)(b) of the 1955 Act).\n##### 2. The higher authority\n21. The higher authority is a senior RAF officer (the Air Officer Commanding). He is not legally qualified. He must decide, in respect of cases referred to him by a CO, whether to refer the matter back to the CO to be dealt with summarily (unless the accused has already elected trial by court-martial); to refer the matter to the prosecuting authority for a decision as to whether the accused should be prosecuted; or to drop the charges. The higher authority's decision is essentially a command decision, the higher authority being required to ask himself whether there are service reasons for prosecuting or not. Once the higher authority has taken this decision, he has no further involvement in the case.\n##### 3. The prosecuting authority\n22. The role of prosecutor is performed by the prosecuting authority. He is appointed by the Queen and must have been legally qualified for ten years (section 83A of the 1955 Act). The prosecuting authority has a staff of between six to eight RAF officers, who are all legally qualified (section 83C of the 1955 Act) and employed full-time on prosecuting duties. The barristers on staff are, as members of the Bar of England and Wales, subject to the professional and ethical duties of the Bar Code of Conduct (including a duty to act with independence and in the interests of justice). Similar professional obligations apply to the solicitors on staff, who are members of the Law Society of England and Wales. Those lawyers also apply the Code for Service Prosecutors, which has been endorsed by the Attorney General.\n23. Following the higher authority's decision to refer a case to it, the prosecuting authority has an absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not to prosecute, what type of court-martial would be appropriate and what charges should be brought. The prosecuting authority also prefers the charges, conducts the prosecution (Part II of Schedule I to the 1996 Act) and, in particular, has the power to make all decisions concerning the prosecution (section 83B(7) of the 1955 Act).\n24. The prosecuting authority (Air Vice Marshal Weeden) was, at the relevant time, also Director of Legal Services (RAF). In his prosecuting role, he was answerable solely to the Attorney General. As Director of Legal Services (RAF) he was answerable to the Air Member for Personnel/Commander in Chief of Personnel and Training Command. Air Vice Marshal Weeden was not reported on in relation to his performance as the prosecuting authority, although he was reported on in relation to his role as Director of Legal Services (RAF). Annual appraisal reports on prosecuting officers were drawn up by 1st reporting officers within the prosecuting authority.\n##### 4. The court administration officers (CAOs)\n25. CAOs are RAF officers appointed by the Defence Council. Once notified of a prosecution by court-martial by the prosecuting authority, a CAO is responsible for making the arrangements for courts-martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a judge advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court-martial. Before commencement of the court-martial hearing, the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible CAO. The Courts-Martial Administration Unit discharges the administration and functions of the CAOs on their behalf and at their direction.\n26. A district court-martial comprises a judge advocate, a president and not less than two serving air-force officers (\u201cthe ordinary members\u201d) of at least two years' experience in the RAF (section 84D of the 1955 Act).\n##### 5. The judge advocate\n27. The Judge Advocate General and his staff of judge advocates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and are civilians who must have at least seven years' experience as advocates or five years' experience as barristers. A judge advocate is appointed to each court-martial (section 84D(1) of the 1955 Act) by the Judge Advocate General.\n28. A judge advocate is robed and sits in the centre with the president and one of the members on his left and the other member on his right. A judge advocate's role during a court-martial is to ensure the fair and regular conduct of the proceedings. He controls the course of the evidence and rules on legal objections. All rulings and directions on questions of law (including questions of procedure and practice) are given by the judge advocate in open court and are binding on the court-martial (section 84B(3) and (4) of the 1955 Act). In this respect, judge advocates have available to them the same model directions (prepared by the Judicial Studies Board) as are available to Crown Court judges. Once the court-martial hearing has commenced, the power to dissolve it is vested in the judge advocate.\n29. A judge advocate also delivers a summing-up and further directions in open court before the members of the court-martial retire to consider their verdict, in the same way as a Crown Court judge would direct the jury. The judge advocate does not retire with the president and ordinary members and has no vote on verdict: as the members of the court-martial are the sole arbiters of fact, they alone must decide whether the charge has been proved or not (section 96(1) and (1A) of the 1955 Act). Following the deliberation on verdict, the judge advocate checks the findings. If he is satisfied that they are not contrary to law, the findings are announced. If he is not so satisfied, he gives the president and ordinary members further directions in open court, following which they retire to reconsider their findings in the light of the judge advocate's directions (Rule 72(3) and (4) of the 1997 Rules). The judge advocate retires with the other members of the court-martial for the deliberations on sentence (during which he can give, if necessary, guidance on the appropriate sentence to be imposed) and votes on sentence.\n6. The president of a court-martial and permanent presidents of courts-martial (\u201cpermanent presidents\u201d)\n30. The president of a court-martial ensures that the hearing is conducted in accordance with service tradition (Rule 33 (1) of the 1997 Rules). During the deliberations on verdict, the president chairs the discussions.\n31. The post of permanent president was first created in 1941, not by any statutory provision but rather as a matter of policy. Permanent presidents were selected from among serving RAF officers of suitable age and rank; they have always had the rank of wing commander. Legal qualifications or experience were not required. The appointment was full-time, was usually expected to be for a period in excess of three years and, almost without exception, was the officer's last posting before his retirement. The Air Secretary had the power to terminate the appointment of a permanent president, although this never happened. While appraisal reports were not prepared on permanent presidents sitting in army courts-martial, such reports were made on those sitting in RAF courts-martial. However, the reports did not concern their judicial decision-making.\n32. In R. v. McKendry (6 March 2000, unreported), the judge advocate held that a particular permanent president could not be regarded as independent and impartial for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Although the ruling was limited to the particular case, recourse to permanent presidents was abandoned pending the outcome of the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Boyd, Hastie and Spear Saunby and Others (\u201cR. v. Boyd and Others\u201d). That judgment was delivered on 18 July 2002 (see paragraphs 63-76 below), but permanent presidents have not been reintroduced to RAF courts-martial.\n##### 7. The ordinary members of courts-martial\n33. There is no requirement that the ordinary members of courts-martial should have formal legal training (Rule 17(b) of the 1997 Rules).\n34. Certain officers cannot be selected for courts-martial. Section 84C(4) of the 1955 Act provides that the CAO, the COs of the accused, members of the higher authority, investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned are all excluded from selection. Rule 17 of the 1997 Rules excludes from selection an officer serving under the command of the higher authority referring the case, the prosecuting authority and the CAO. The Queen's Regulations for the RAF (QR 1154(f)) further underline that, so far as is practicable, a court-martial is to be composed of officers from different RAF stations.\n35.

Mahoney, Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 1 October and on 3 December 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. General\n16. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into effect on 1 April 1997 and amended, inter alia, the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (references below to \u201cthe 1957 Act\u201d are to that Act as amended). Naval courts-martial are regulated, inter alia, by the 1957 Act, by the Courts-Martial (Royal Navy) Rules 1997, as amended (\u201cthe 1997 Rules\u201d) and by the Queen's Regulations for the Royal Navy (\u201cQRRN\u201d).\n17. Section 42 of the 1957 Act provides that any person subject to naval law who commits a civilian offence, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, shall be guilty of an offence against that section.\n18. Section 43(1) of the 1957 Act lists the punishments available to a court-martial following conviction and establishes, as a matter of law, the relative positions of each punishment in the hierarchy of punishments available (the \u201cCoda\u201d to section 43(1) of the 1957 Act).\n#### B. The court-martial \u2013 participants and procedure\n##### 1. The Commanding Officer (\u201cCO\u201d)\n19. An allegation that a person subject to naval law has committed an offence must be reported to the CO of the accused. The CO must investigate the charge after which the CO may dismiss the charge, refer it to the Higher Authority or try the accused summarily.\n##### 2. The Higher Authority\n20. The Higher Authority is a senior naval officer. Although he is not legally qualified, he is legally advised by a barrister. He must decide, in respect of cases referred to him by a CO, whether to refer the matter back to that CO to be dealt with summarily (unless the accused has already elected trial by court-martial); to refer the matter to the Prosecuting Authority for a decision as to whether the accused should be prosecuted; or to drop the charges. The Higher Authority's decision is essentially a command decision, the Higher Authority being required to ask himself whether there are service reasons for prosecuting or not. Once the Higher Authority has taken this decision, he has no further involvement in the case.\n##### 3. The Prosecuting Authority\n21. The role of prosecutor is performed by the Prosecuting Authority of the Royal Navy. The Prosecuting Authority is appointed by Her Majesty the Queen (section 52H of the 1957 Act) and is accountable to the Attorney-General for the performance of his prosecuting functions.\n22. In almost all cases (88% of cases prosecuted in 2002 and up to mid-2003) the Prosecuting Authority appoints barristers to prosecute cases from his own staff, which barristers work exclusively for the Prosecuting Authority. On occasion, however, the Prosecuting Authority appoints prosecutors from a list of uniformed naval barristers who are eligible to act as prosecutors but who do not, in their general duties, work directly for the Prosecuting Authority (unlike in the army and air force where prosecutions are carried out exclusively by prosecutors on the staff of the relevant Prosecuting Authority). Such an officer may be working in a legal or non-legal post, but will always be outside the chain of command of the accused and will always be answerable for his duties as a prosecutor to the Prosecuting Authority.\n23. Naval barristers appointed to act as prosecutors are members of the Bar of England and Wales and are consequently subject to the professional arrangements and ethical duties of the Bar Code of Conduct (including a duty to act with independence and in the interests of justice). The Prosecuting Authority and all acting prosecutors also apply the Code for Service Prosecutors which has been endorsed by the Attorney General and which sets out how their duties should be carried out.\n24. Following the Higher Authority's decision to refer a case to it, the Prosecuting Authority has an absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not to prosecute and, if so, to determine precisely what charges should be brought. The Prosecuting Authority conducts the prosecution (Part II, Schedule I to the 1996 Act), which is brought on behalf of the Crown.\n##### 4. The Naval Court Administration Officer (\u201cNCAO\u201d)\n25. The NCAO is a civilian and a civil servant, working in \u201cone of the secretariats dealing with naval service discipline policy issues\u201d. The NCAO is responsible for making the arrangements for courts-martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a Judge Advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court. The NCAO is appointed by the Defence Council. Before commencement of the court-martial hearing, the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible NCAO.\n26. Naval courts-martial consist of a President, four to eight serving naval officers of at least three years' military experience and a Judge Advocate (since the entry into force of the Armed Forces Act 2001 - \u201cthe 2001 Act\u201d - warrant officers may also sit as members). The distinction made between district and general courts-martial in the army and air force does not exist in the Royal Navy. Contrary also to the position in the army and air force, the Royal Navy does not appoint, and has never appointed, Perm", "001-61561": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF SADIK \u00d6NDER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ...is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\nThis section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which back dated to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n18. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)c).\n19. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000, which permitted remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the Government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, a statement that in introducing the measure in Parliament the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n20. On 22 February 2001, the Secretary of State gave his reasons for maintaining the policy of disenfranchising convicted prisoners:\n\u201cBy committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender\u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence, such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period. There is more than one element to punishment than forcible detention. Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society, amongst which is the right to vote for one\u2019s representative.\u201d\n21. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d)\n22. Relevant provisions of the ICCPR provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\u201d\n23. In the General Comment (No. 25(57)) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40(4) of the ICCPR dated 27 August 1996, the Committtee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable.

Section 103 \u00a7 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrgesetz), as amended in 1986, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe authority may request information as to who had driven a certain motor vehicle identified by the number plate .... at a certain time or had last parked such a motor vehicle ... at a certain place before a certain date. The registered car owner ... must provide such information, which must include the name and address of the person concerned; if he or she is unable to give such information, he/she must name a person who can do so and who will then be under an obligation to inform the authority; the statements made by the person required to give information do not release the authority from its duty to review such statements where this seems appropriate in the circumstances of the case. The requested information is to be provided immediately or, in case of a written request, within two weeks after the request has been served; where such information cannot be provided without keeping pertinent records, such records shall be kept. The authority's right to require such information shall take precedence over the right to refuse to give information.\u201d\n25.

The judge or court concerned shall make the referral only when the case is ready for trial and within the time allowed for giving judgment. They must specify which law or provision having the status of law is alleged to be unconstitutional and which Article of the Constitution is considered to have been breached. They must also state the precise reasons why the outcome of the proceedings depends on the validity of the contested provision. Before taking a final decision on whether to refer an issue to the Constitutional Court, the judge or court shall first hear any representations the parties and a representative of State Counsel's Office may wish to make regarding the relevance of the issue within a ten-day non-extendable time-limit that shall apply to each of them.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Constitution\n26. The relevant provisions of the Constitution provide:\nArticle 2\n\u201cThe Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular (laik) and social State based on the rule of law, respectful of human rights in a spirit of social peace, national solidarity and justice, adhering to the nationalism of Atat\u00fcrk and resting on the fundamental principles set out in the Preamble.\u201d\nArticle 4\n\u201cNo amendment may be made or proposed to the provisions of Article 1 of the Constitution laying down that the State shall be a Republic, the provisions of Article 2 concerning the characteristics of the Republic or the provisions of Article 3.\u201d\nArticle 10 \u00a7 1\n\u201cAll individuals shall be equal before the law without any distinction based on language, race, colour, sex, political opinion, philosophical belief, religion, membership of a religious sect or other similar grounds.\u201d\nArticle 14 \u00a7 1\n\u201cNone of the rights and freedoms referred to in the Constitution shall be exercised with a view to undermining the territorial integrity of the State and the unity of the nation, jeopardising the existence of the Turkish State or Republic, abolishing fundamental rights and freedoms, placing the control of the State in the hands of a single individual or group, ensuring the domination of one social class over other social classes, introducing discrimination on the grounds of language, race, religion or membership of a religious body, or establishing by any other means a political system based on such concepts and opinions.\u201d\nArticle 24 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4\n\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of conscience, belief and religious conviction. Prayers, worship and religious services shall be conducted freely, provided that they do not violate the provisions of Article 14. No one shall be compelled to participate in prayers, worship or religious services or to reveal his religious beliefs and convictions; nor shall he be censured or prosecuted because of his religious beliefs or convictions.\n...\nNo one may exploit or abuse religion, religious feelings or things held sacred by religion in any manner whatsoever with a view to causing the social, economic, political or legal order of the State to be based on religious precepts, even if only in part, or for the purpose of securing political or personal interest or influence thereby.\u201d\n#### B. History and background\n##### 1. Religious dress and the principle of secularism\n27. The Turkish Republic was founded on the principle that the State should be secular (laik). After the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923, the public and religious spheres were separated through a series of revolutionary reforms: the abolition of the caliphate on 3 March 1923; the repeal of the constitutional provision declaring Islam the religion of the State on 10 April 1928; and, lastly, on 5 February 1937 a constitutional amendment according constitutional status to the principle of secularism (see Article 2 of the Constitution of 1924 and Article 2 of the Constitutions of 1961 and 1982, as set out in paragraph 26 above).\n28. The main feature of the republican system was the status accorded to women\u2019s rights, with women being granted equality in the enjoyment of individual rights. The process began on 17 February 1926 with the adoption of the Civil Code, which provided for equality of the sexes in the enjoyment of civic rights, in particular as regards divorce and succession. Subsequently, through a constitutional amendment of 5 December 1934 (Article 10 of the 1924 Constitution), women obtained equal political rights with men.\n29. At the time of the Ottoman Empire both the central government and religious groups required people to dress in accordance with their religious affiliations. The reforms introduced by the Republic on the question of dress were inspired by the evolution of society in the nineteenth century and sought first and foremost to create a religion-free zone in which all citizens were guaranteed equality, without distinction on the grounds of religion or denomination. The first enactment in this sphere was the Headgear Act of 28 November 1925 (Law no. 671), which treated dress as an issue relating to modernity. Similarly, a ban was imposed on wearing religious attire other than in places of worship or at religious ceremonies, irrespective of the religion or belief concerned, by the Dress (Regulations) Act of 3 December 1934 (Law no. 2596).\n30. Under the Education Services (Merger) Act of 3 March 1924 (Law no. 430), religious schools were closed and all schools came under the control of the Ministry for Education. This Act is one of the laws enjoying constitutional status that are protected by Article 174 of the Turkish Constitution.\n31. Wearing the Islamic headscarf to school and university is a recent phenomenon in Turkey, which began in the 1980s. There has been extensive discussion on the issue and it continues to be the subject of lively debate in Turkish society. Those in favour of the headscarf see wearing it as a duty and/or form of expression linked to religious identity, whereas those against regard it as a symbol of a political Islam that is seeking to establish a regime based on religious precepts and threatens to cause civil unrest and undermine the rights acquired by women under the republican system. The accession to power on 28 June 1996 of a coalition government comprising the Islamist Refah Partisi, and the centre-right Do\u011fru Yol Partisi, has given the debate strong political overt", "001-61897": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF BENEFICIO CAPPELLA PAOLINI v.

After Article 153 of the Civil Code was amended the Ankara District Court raised an objection with the Constitutional Court, arguing that the provision was unconstitutional. In a decision of 29 September 1998 (E 1997/61, K 1998/59) the Court dismissed the objection for the following reasons:\n\u201cThe rule according to which married women bear their husband\u2019s name derives from certain social realities and is the result of the codification of certain customs that have formed over centuries in Turkish society. According to the thinking behind family law, the purpose of the rule is to protect women, who are of a more delicate nature than men, strengthen family bonds, nurture the prosperity of the marriage, and preclude bicephalous authority within the same family.\nFor the sake of protecting family unity the legislature has recognised the primacy of the husband\u2019s name over the wife\u2019s. Considerations of public interest and policy have been decisive. Moreover, under the new provision women are now allowed to keep their maiden name in front of their surname ... .\nFurthermore, the contention that this provision infringes Article 10 of the Constitution, which prohibits any discrimination on the ground of sex, is not ", "001-67582": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF G\u00dcM\u00dc\u015eTEN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. The 1988 Infectious Diseases Act (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d) divides infectious diseases into diseases dangerous to society and other infectious diseases. One of the diseases described as dangerous to society is the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The relevant provisions of the 1988 Act read as follows:\nSection 5\n\u201cEach county council [landsting] shall be responsible for ensuring that the necessary measures for the prevention of infectious diseases are taken within its area ...\u201d\nSection 6\n\u201cEvery county council shall have a county medical officer ...\u201d\nSection 13\n\u201cIt shall be the duty of any person having reason to suspect that he has been infected with a disease dangerous to society to consult a physician without delay and to allow the physician to carry out examinations and to take any specimens needed in order to establish whether he has been infected with such a disease. It shall also be his duty to comply with the practical instructions issued to him by the physician. The same shall apply when a person, having been infected with a disease dangerous to society, states that he has been in contact with some other person in such a way that the infection may have been transmitted.\u201d\nSection 14\n\u201cAny person infected with a disease dangerous to society must supply the consulting physician with information concerning the person or persons from whom the infection may have come or to whom it may have been passed on, and must supply general particulars concerning the possible source of the infection and where it may have been spread further.\u201d\nSection 16\n\u201cThe consulting physician shall issue to a person being examined for a disease dangerous to society any practical instructions needed to prevent the spread of the infection. These instructions may refer to that person's contact with the physician, hygiene, isolation in the home, employment and attendance at educational establishments, as well as his general way of life. The instructions shall be included in the infected person's medical record. The physician must as far as possible see to it that the instructions are complied with.\u201d\nSection 17\n\u201cAt the request of the individual concerned or of his own motion, the county medical officer may alter the instructions in the manner he finds most appropriate.\u201d\nSection 25\n\u201cA consulting physician having reason to believe that a patient infected or suspected of being infected with a disease dangerous to society will not comply, or is not complying with the practical instructions issued, must promptly notify the county medical officer. This shall also apply when such a patient discontinues his current treatment without the consent of the consulting physician.\u201d\nSection 28\n\u201c... Before resorting to any coercive measure, the county medical officer must try to obtain voluntary compliance if this can be done without the risk of the infection being spread.\u201d\nSection 30\n\u201cA county medical officer who has been informed by a consulting physician that a patient carrying the HIV infection has not complied, or is suspected of not complying, with the practical instructions issued shall notify the social welfare committee, the police authority and the principal probation officer. In doing so he shall supply particulars concerning the identity of the person to whom the practical instructions apply and the implications of those instructions. No information shall be supplied if the county medical officer believes this unnecessary in order to secure compliance with the practical instructions or otherwise finds it immaterial with regard to the prevention of communicable disease.\u201d\nSection 38\n\u201cThe County Administrative Court, on being petitioned by the county medical officer, shall make an order for the compulsory isolation of a person infected with a disease dangerous to society if that person does not voluntarily comply with the measures needed in order to prevent the infection from spreading. An order of this kind shall also be made if there is reasonable cause to suppose that the infected person is not complying with the practical instructions issued and this omission entails a manifest risk of the infection being spread. Compulsory isolation shall take place in a hospital run by a county council.\u201d\nSection 39\n\u201cIf a compulsory isolation order by the County Administrative Court cannot be awaited without danger, the county medical officer shall issue an order of the kind referred to in section 38. The order issued shall thus be submitted immediately to the County Administrative Court for approval.\u201d\nSection 40\n\u201cCompulsory isolation may continue for up to three months from the day on which the infect", "001-68112": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF CROWTHER v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 January 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Disability benefits\n12. According to Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act (as in force until 1 January 2001, when the 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance - lagen (1998:703) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force), a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1997 the basic amount was SEK 36,300. In 1983, when the applicant turned 65, it was SEK 19,400.\n13. According to Chapter 9, section 3 of the 1962 Act (as in force at the material time), such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount, depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability.\n#### B. Procedure\n14. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act could form the subject of an appeal to the County Administrative Court, to the Administrative Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n15. The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings shall be in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing (I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas, om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det)\u201d.\nUnder those circumstan", "001-68396": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF NOWICKY v.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n30. The applicant complained that none of the authorities dealing with his case is a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention.\n31. The applicant further complained that the length of the proceedings was incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement. In this respect he also relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which, as far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n#### A.

The relevant statutory provisions and domestic case-law are set out in Lloyd and Others v. the United Kingdom, nos. 29798/96 and others, judgment of 1 March 2005, \u00a7\u00a7 35-87; hereinafter \u201cLloyd\u201d). Of additional relevance in this case is the case-law set out below.\nThe length of the threat of imprisonment\n17. In R. v. Ealing Justices ex parte Cloves [1991] RVR 169, the Divisional Court held that a committal order which had been suspended on the basis of the debtor paying one pound sterling (GBP) per week in discharge of the arrears of rates due was quashed since it would have taken over eight years for the debt to be discharged and the risk of committal removed. During the course of his judgment, Lord Justice Nolan stated as follows:\n\u201c ... The criminal courts, when imposing fines upon convicted defendants of limited means, frequently provide for the fines to be paid by instalments over a period. There is no fixed limit to the period over which payment can be ordered. It has recently been indicated by the Court of Appeal that in appropriate circumstances a period of three years might not be excessive. ...\n... In my judgment it would be a very rare case indeed in which a defaulting rate-payer could properly be ordered, on pain of a sentence of imprisonment, to make payments in discharge of the arrears for a period anywhere near approaching eight years. In my judgment, with great respect to the Justices, unless they were confident that she could pay it off more quickly they should not have made the order in those terms.\u201d\n18. In the above-cited case of R. v. Newcastle-upon-Tyne Justices ex parte Devine, Mr Justice Latham referred to the above-cited ex parte Cloves case in stating that the magistrates should not have imposed a suspended committal order which would have lasted for three and a half years. He was of the opinion that such an order should not be suspended for more than three years.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19.

The Criminal Code\n16. Any sexual acts with persons under 14 years of age are punishable under Articles 206 and 207 of the Criminal Code.\n17. Article 209 of the Criminal Code, in the version in force at the material time, read as follows:\n\u201cA male person who after attaining the age of 19 fornicates with a person of the same sex who has attained the age of 14 but not the age of 18 shall be sentenced to imprisonment for between six months and five years.\u201d\n18. This provision was aimed at consensual homosexual acts, as any sexual act of adults with persons up to 19 years of age are punishable under Article 212 of the Criminal Code if the adult abuses a position of authority (parent, employer, teacher, doctor, etc.). Any sexual acts involving the use of force or threats are punishable as rape, pursuant to Article 201, or sexual coercion pursuant to Article 202 of the Criminal Code. Consensual heterosexual or lesbian acts between adults and persons over 14 years of age are not punishable.\n19. On 10 July 2002, following the Constitutional Court's judgment of 21 June 2002 (see paragraph 23 below), Parliament decided to repeal Article 209. That amendment, published in the Official Gazette (Bundesgesetzblatt) no. 134/2002, came into force on 14 August 2002.\n#### B. The Constitutional Court's judgments\n##### 1.

Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001 (see paragraphs 38-39 below), provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issuing of a decision or order:\n\u201c1. If, in consequence of the issuing of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issuing of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of a criminal prosecution or a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the person\u2019s superior.\n2. The fact that such guilt has not been established by means of a criminal conviction or a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury\u2019s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] bar to prosecution or disciplinary action.\u201d\n##### 2. Provisions applicable from 1 September 2004\n36.

Fribergh, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 April and 29 August 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ... is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\n22. This section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which dated back to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n23. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)(a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)(c)).\n24. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000 (\u201cthe 2000 Act\u201d), which allowed remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, indicating that, in introducing the measure in Parliament, the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n25. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\n...\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n26. The relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote ...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation. ...\u201d\n27. In General Comment no. 25(57) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40 \u00a7 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 12 July 1996, the Committee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.\u201d\n#### B. The European Prison Rules (Recommendation No. R (87) 3 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe)\n28. These rules set out the minimum standards to be applied to conditions of imprisonment, including the following principle:\n\u201c64. Imprisonment is by the deprivation of liberty a punishment in itself. The conditions of imprisonment and the prison regimes shall not, therefore, except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in this.\u201d\n#### C. Recommendation Rec(2003)23 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the management by prison administrations of life sentence and other long-term prisoners\n29. This recommendation, adopted on 9 October 2003, noted the increase in life sentences and aimed to give guidance to member States on the management of long-term prisoners.\n30. The aims of the management of such prisoners should be:\n\u201c2. ...\n\u2013 to ensure that prisons are safe and secure places for these prisoners ...;\n\u2013 to counteract the damaging effects of life and long-term imprisonment;\n\u2013 to increase and improve the possibilities of these prisoners to be successfully resettled and to lead a law-abiding life following their release.\u201d\n31. General principles included the following:\n\u201c3. Consideration should be given to the diversity of personal characteristics to be found among life sentence and long-term prisoners and account taken of them to make individual plans for the implementation of the sentence (individualisation principle).\n4. Prison life should be arranged so as to approximate as closely as possible to the realities of life in the community (normalisation principle).\n5. Prisoners should be given opportunities to exercise personal responsibility in daily prison life (responsibility principle).\u201d\n#### D. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters\n32. This document adopted by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) at its 51st Plenary Session (5-6 July 2002) and submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 6 November 2002 includes the Commission\u2019s guidelines as to the circumstances in which there may be a deprivation of the right to vote or to be elected:\n\u201cd. ...\ni. provision may be made for depriving individuals of their right to vote and to be elected, but only subject to the following cumulative conditions:\nii. it must be provided for by law;\niii. the proportionality principle must be observed; conditions for depriving individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them;\niv. the deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence;\nv. furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law.\u201d\n#### E. Law and practice in Contracting States\n33. According to the Government\u2019s survey based on information obtained from its diplomatic representation, eighteen countries allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), in thirteen countries all prisoners were barred from voting or unable to vote (Armenia, Belgium\n0, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom), while in twelve countries prisoners\u2019 right to vote could be limited in some other way (Austria0, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania and Spain0).\n34. Other material before the Court indicates that in Romania prisoners may be debarred from voting if the principal sentence exceeds two years, while in Latvia prisoners serving a sentence in penitentiaries are not entitled to vote; nor are prisoners in Liechtenstein.\n#### F. Relevant case-law from other States\n##### 1. Canada\n35. In 1992 the Canadian Supreme Court unanimously struck down a legislative provision barring all prisoners from voting (see Sauv\u00e9 v. Canada (no. 1), cited above). Amendments were introduced limiting the ban to prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the provision. However, following the decision of the Divisional Court in the present case, the Supreme Court on 31 October 2002 in Sauv\u00e9 v. the Attorney General of Canada (no. 2) held by five votes to four that section 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act 1985, which denied the right to vote to every person imprisoned in a correctional institution serving a sentence of two years or more, was unconstitutional as it infringed Articles 1 and 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides:\n\u201c1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\u201d\n\u201c3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein.\u201d\n36. The majority opinion given by McLachlin CJ considered that the right to vote was fundamental to their democracy and the rule of law and could not be lightly set aside. Limits on this right required not deference, but careful examination. The majority found that the Government had failed to", "001-70524": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF MAJEWSKI v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 October 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n28. The basic provisions concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in Sweden are to be found in the Aliens Act (Utl\u00e4nningslagen, 1989:529). An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden (chapter 3, section 4 of the Act). The term \u201crefugee\u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or religious or political opinion, and who is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail him- or herself of protection in that country. This applies irrespective of whether or not persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country, if the authorities cannot be relied on to offer protection against persecution by private individuals (chapter 3, section 2). By \u201can alien otherwise in need of protection\u201d (chapter 3, section 3) is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because he or she has a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n29. In addition, when it comes to enforcing a decision to refuse entry to or to deport an alien, regard must be had to the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to a special provision on bars to enforcement (chapter 8, section 1), an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds (sk\u00e4lig anledning) for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n### III.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 1 and 7 December 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n14. The Government in their submissions on the merits raised the same objection as at the admissibility stage concerning the victim status of the applicant. In particular, they maintained that the property allegedly owned by the applicant had been registered in the books of the Turkish Muslim religious trust (vakf) as having been dedicated to the religious trust in perpetuity in accordance with the relevant rules and principles and could not be transferred to individuals as private property. They noted that the applicant had not produced an authentic title deed showing registration of her name as recorded in the books of the Land Office but a document certifying that the properties in her name were \u201cTurkish-held properties\u201d. Turkey was not in possession or control of the Land Office records of the \u201cTRNC\u201d and the Government therefore wished to reserve their position to finalise the information about the history of the title to the properties in question.\n15. The Court notes that the Government\u2019s objection was duly examined and dismissed in its admissibility decision of 14 March 2005 in which it found that the applicant could claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. In its decision, among other things, the Court pointed out that the respondent Government had not substantiated their arguments. The Government have not submitted any new information in this regard within the time allowed. The Court therefore sees no reason to depart from its findings in this respect.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained of an unjustified interference with the right to respect for her home, in violation of Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n##### 1.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (por\u0119czenie maj\u0105tkowe), police supervision (doz\u00f3r policji), guarantee by a responsible person (por\u0119czenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a social entity (por\u0119czenie spo\u0142eczne), temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskar\u017conego w okre\u015blonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci) and prohibition on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).\n20. Article 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:\n\u201c1. Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused\u2019s committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if the evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d\n21. Article 258 lists grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand may be imposed if:\n(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];\n(2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co-defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of procee", "001-71944": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SEL\u00c7UK v.

Associations employing violence, or aiming to attain their object by violence, by instigation to violence, or by similar punishable influence on persons holding other views, shall be dissolved by a court judgment.\n3. No association shall be dissolved by any government measure; however, an association may be temporarily prohibited, provided that proceedings are instituted immediately for its dissolution.\n4. Cases relating to the dissolution of political associations may, without special permission, be brought before the Supreme Court [Rigets \u00f8verste domstol].\n5. The legal effects of such dissolution shall be determined by statute.\u201d\n19. The relevant parts of the Protection against Dismissal due to Association Membership Act of 9 June 1982 (which was passed as a direct result of the Court's ruling in Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44), as amended by Law no. 347 of 29 May 1990, read as follows:\nSection 1\n\u201cAn employer may not dismiss an employee on the ground that he or she is a member of an association or of a specific association.\u201d\nSection 2\n\u201c(1) An employer may not dismiss an employee on the ground that he or she is not a member of an association or of a specific association.\n(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply if the employee, prior to recruitment, knew that the employer made membership of an association or of a specific association a condition for being employed with the enterprise.\n(3) Subsection (1) shall furthermore not be applicable where an employee who is a member of an association is informed subsequent to recruitment that membership is a condition for continued employment with the enterprise.\u201d\nSection 3\n\u201cSections 1 and 2 of the Act shall not apply in respect of employers whose business is specifically aimed at furthering political, ideological, religious or cultural ends, where the membership of the person concerned must be considered of importance for the business.\u201d\nSection 4\n\u201cWhere an employee is dismissed contrary to the provisions of this Act, the dismissal must be overruled and the employment continued or restored, if a claim to this end is made. However, this shall not apply to employees in the private sector if, in special cases and following the balancing of the interests of the parties, it is found manifestly unreasonable to claim continuation of the employment or reinstatement.\u201d\nSection 4a\n\u201c(1) Where an employee is dismissed contrary to the provisions of this Act without the dismissal being overruled, the employer shall pay compensation.\n(2) The compensation, which may not be less than one month's salary or wages and may not exceed twenty-four months' salary or wages, must be fixed in view of the period of employment and the circumstances of the case in general. If the employment has lasted for at least two years, such compensation may not be less than three months' salary or wages.\u201d\nSection 4b\n\u201c(1) Cases under this Act must be processed as quickly as possible.\n(2) During the hearing of a case concerning dismissal, the court may order that the dismissal should not become effective until the case has been finally decided by means of a judgment. The judgment may specify that the dismissal will not be stayed in case of an appeal.\u201d\n20. The question of the lawfulness of closed-shop agreements in relation to the 1982 Act and the European Convention on Human Rights was examined by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 6 May 1999 (concerning Mr Jensen, applicant in the original case of Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 52620/99, 20 March 2003). The Supreme Court found for the defendant and awarded him damages in the amount of 200,000 Danish kroner (DKK). As regards Article 11 of the Convention, the Supreme Court stated:\n\u201cAccording to the Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 August 1981, Series A no. 44 (the British Rail judgment) it is in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning freedom of association to dismiss an employee who refuses to join a trade union with whom the employer has entered into a closed-shop agreement at a time after the employment of the employee, in so far as membership was not a condition for the employment. The Court emphasised that it did not decide on closed-shop agreements as such, but only on its effect on the three applicants.\nIn the Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u03ccnsson v. Iceland judgment of 30 June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 11 in a situation where a holder of a taxi licence had his licence revoked because he resigned from a specific association of taxicab owners. The Court found it of importance that obligatory membership of the association was imposed on him by law and that there was no duty to join the association when Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u03ccnsson obtained his taxi licence as the original requirement to do so lacked a legal basis. As in the British Rail judgment, the Court emphasised that it did not decide on the scope of Article 11 of the Convention in relation to the negative freedom of association.\nAgainst this background, the Supreme Court finds no reasons in the Sigur\u00f0ur A. Sigurj\u03ccnsson judgment to assess the lawfulness of closed-shop agreements and their consequences any differently than what appears from the British Rail judgment. The same goes for the remainder of the judgments that the parties have referred to (Sibson v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 20 April 1993, Series A no. 258, and Gustafsson v. Sweden, judgment of 25 April 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II).\u201d\nAlso, in another judgment of 12 May 2000, the Supreme Court found that closed-shop agreements as such were not contrary to Article 11 of the Convention as that provision had been interpreted by the Strasbourg Court.\n21. The relevant parts of the Act on Private Contributions to Political Parties and Disclosure of the Accounts of Political Parties (Law no. 404 of 13 June 1990 \u2013 Lov om private bidrag til politiske partier og offentligg\u00f8relse af politiske partiers regnskaber), as amended by Law no. 394 of 14 June 1995, provide:\nSection 1\n\u201cEmployers' federations, trade unions and other trade associations whose main objectives are to attend to the economic interests of the trade group to which their members belong shall ensure that any financial contribution to political parties or for party-political purposes in general collected as part of membership fees are collected on a voluntary basis for each individual member.\u201d\nSection 2\n\u201c(1) A member who wishes to be exempt from payment of contributions to political parties or for political purposes in general as part of the membership fees shall submit a written declaration to this effect.\n(2) Once a year the association shall forward to its members a form containing the wording of such a declaration. Publishing the form in a members' journal or a similar publication may fulfil this obligation. The declaration must have the following wording: 'I wish to be exempt from payment of contributions to political parties or for party-political purposes in general as part of my membership fees.'\n(3) The declaration must be forwarded to the auditor of the association. This must be apparent from the form referred to in subsection (2) above. Declarations sent to association offices by members must be forwarded to the auditor immediately. The Minister of Justice may lay down further provisions on the layout of the form and on the auditors' treatment of declarations received.\n(4) Information on persons who are exempt from payment of contributions or who have made a request to this effect may not be subject to any unauthorised disclosure.\u201d\n22. A general description of the background of closed-shop agreements in the Danish labour market is given below.\nThe struggle at the end of the nineteenth century between, on the one side, employees and their unions (notably what is today called the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO)) and, on the other side, the employers and their federations (mainly the Confederation of Danish Employers (Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening \u2013 DA)) resulted in the so-called September Agreement of 1899 between LO and DA.\nThe Agreement laid down five major principles:\n(1) the right of employees to organise within trade unions;\n(2) the right of employers to manage and control work;\n(3) the right to industrial action (strikes, boycotts and lockouts) in order to obtain, for example, a collective agreement;\n(4) the embargo on industrial action, which means that no strikes are lawful during the term of a collective agreement; and\n(5) the establishment of a special arbitration tribunal to deal with all violations of the September Agreement.\nThe September Agreement is unique in that it has formed the basis of all subsequent general agreements between management and labour. Traditionally, the Danish legislature plays a minor role as regards the conditions governing wages, salaries and employment. Therefore, only to a certain extent does the Danish labour market have legislation which does not emanate from European Union directives, examples being the Salaried Employees' Act (Funktion\u00e6rloven) and the Holiday Act (Ferieloven). Accordingly, rights imposed by statute in other countries have in Denmark been obtained by means of agreements between the labour-market partners. It is thus a characteristic feature of Danish law that the relationship between employers and employees is basically governed by a combination of agreements (collective and individual), labour-law principles, general statutes and rules laid down in pursuance of statutes. More than 80% of all employees in Denmark are trade union members.\nFrom figures provided by Statistics Denmark (Danmarks Statistikbank) and the Ministry of Employment (Besk\u00e6ftigelsesministeriet), in 2001 the Danish workforce consisted of 2,799,958 persons (inclusive of the unemployed). Of these, 1,611,715 were employed within the private sector and 937,826 within the public sector.\nThe Government estimate that nearly 80% of all e", "001-72150": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DEL\u0130G\u00d6Z v.

In their supplementary observations dated 29 April 2005, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the \u2018Law on the Compensation of Losses Resulting from Terrorist Acts and the Measures Taken against Terrorism\u2019 adopted on 14 July 2004. This Law provided for a sufficient remedy capable of redressing the Convention grievances of the applicant who had suffered damages during the authorities\u2019 struggle against terrorism. The Government therefore asked the Court to suspend the examination of this application and to require the applicant to avail himself of the new remedy introduced in domestic law.\n38. The applicant disputed the Government\u2019s objection and argued that he could not be required to exhaust a new remedy after the admissibility decision of the Court.\n39. The Court recalls that in its admissibility decision of 2 September 2003 it has already held that the applicant was not required to pursue any further remedy in domestic law given the lack of an effective investigation into his complaints. It notes that this objection was raised after the application was declared admissible. On that account, the Government may be considered in principle estopped from raising their objections to admissibility at this stage (Rule 55 of the Rules of Court; see inter alia, Amrollahi v. Denmark, no. 56811/00, \u00a7 22, 11 July 2002; and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999-II).

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Provisions of the 1987 Act\n36. The 1987 Act entered into force on 1 July 1987 and contains provisions about the planning of land and water areas as well as buildings. Their purpose is to promote the development of a society characterised by equal and good living conditions for people today and for future generations, whilst having due regard to the freedom of the individual (Chapter 1, section 1).\nThe provisions of the 1987 Act which are relevant to the present case read as follows:\n\u201cChapter 1 - Introductory provisions\nSection 5\nWhen issues are examined in accordance with this Act, consideration shall be given to both public and private interests unless otherwise provided.\nSection 6\nLand shall only be used for development if it is suitable for this purpose from the public interest point of view. The examination of suitability is carried out in connection with a planning procedure or during the examination of an application for a building permit or tentative approval....\nChapter 5 - Detailed development plans and area regulations\nSection 1\nThe examination of the suitability of the site for development and the regulation of the manner of design of the area of construction are to be carried out in accordance with a detailed development plan, which applies to\n##### 1. new continuous developments;\n2. new individual buildings, the use of which will have significant impact on the surroundings or which are to be located in an area where there is considerable demand for building sites, or where the examination of the proposed building cannot be carried out in connection with the review of the application for a building permit or tentative approval....\nChapter 8 - Building permit, demolition permit and land permit\nSection 34\nUpon application, the Building Committee shall give tentative approval for a particular measure, requiring a building permit, to be permitted on a designated site.\nWhen a tentative approval is granted, it shall contain the necessary conditions. The tentative approval is binding if an application for a building permit is made within two years from the date when the tentative approval was granted.\nIf an application for a building permit is not made within the time specified in the second paragraph, the tentative approval will cease to be valid. ...\u201d\n#### B. Provisions on the 1988 Act\n37. The 1988 Act was introduced as a result of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 findings in several cases, notably against Sweden, that lack of judicial review of certain administrative decisions infringed Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. It was enacted as a temporary law to remain in force until 1991; its validity has subsequently been extended, as from 1 July 1996 without any limitation in time.\nPursuant to section 1 of this Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or any other public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only court, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-\u00e0-vis a private individual. The kinds of administrative decisions covered by the Act are further defined in Chapter 8, sections 2 and 3 of the Instrument of Government (regeringsformen), to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decisions falling outside its scope, none of which is relevant in the instant case.\nIn proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, t", "001-72664": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF YASSAR HUSSAIN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. The personal and financial liability of public accountants\n13. Section 60-I of Finance Law no. 63-156 of 23 February 1963 provides that public accountants are personally and financially liable for the audits they are required to carry out of income, expenditure and assets on the terms set forth in the general public accounting rules. In that connection, Articles 12 and 13 of Decree no. 62-1587 of 29 December 1962, which lay down general rules governing public accounting, provide as follows:\nArticle 12\n\u201cAccountants are required:\n...\nB \u2013 in connection with expenditure, to check\nthat the authorising officer or his delegate has the requisite capacity to act;\nthat the funds are available;\nthat the expenditure is accurately attributed to the appropriate heads, in accordance with its nature or purpose;\nthat the claims are valid according to the terms set forth in Article 13 below;\nthat payment has been effected in accordance with the statutory conditions for discharging the debtor.\n...\u201d\nArticle 13\n\u201cWith regard to the validity of the claims, accountants shall check\nthat the service has actually been rendered and the amounts accurately calculated;\nthat the statutory controls have been effected and the supporting documents produced.\nIn addition, in so far as provided by the rules specific to each public institution, public accountants shall check that the financial controllers\u2019 stamp of approval has been affixed to the liabilities and payment authorisations issued by the main authorising officers.\nPublic accountants shall also check that the rules on limitation periods have been applied.\u201d\nPublic accountants who have been found liable or whose liability is in issue may, in cases of force majeure, be fully or partly discharged from liability; they may also obtain remission, on a non-contentious application, in respect of amounts for which they remain liable (section 60-IX of Law no. 63-156). The Government indicated that decisions on this type of application were made by the Minister of Finance, who \u201cdifferentiated between what was a personal failing and what was a case of force majeure or circumstances capable of mitigating the accountant\u2019s liability (such as inadequacy of the resources attached to the post)\u201d.\n2. Judicial scrutiny of accounts rendered by public accountants of local authorities and their public institutions\n(a) Regional audit offices\n14. Accounts rendered by public accountants are subjected to judicial scrutiny. This task is entrusted to regional audit offices in respect of accounts rendered by public accountants of territorial authorities and their public institutions (Articles L. 211-1 et seq. of the Financial Judicature Code). They carry out a judicial inspection of the regularity of operations by accountants regarding both revenue and expenditure. The procedure is a mandatory one in which the regional audit offices give judgment clearing and settling the accounts irrespective of whether or not irregularities have been disclosed. The purpose of the inspection is not only to check that the accounts are in order, but also that the accountant has properly carried out all the necessary checks concerning, inter alia, the basis and the amount of any revenue or expenditure, and has not negligently caused a loss to the local authority.\nFinal judgments discharge the accountant or levy a surcharge against him, that is, require him to pay a sum back to the local authority (Article L. 231-7 of the Financial Judicature Code) and thus personally bear the financial consequences of an irregularity in management of the accounts.\nThis judicial scrutiny is conducted in the following stages: production of the accounts by the local public accountant; adversarial investigation; report by the investigating judge; deliberations by the regional audit office; interim ruling; accountant\u2019s reply; deliberations by the regional audit office; final judgment (discharge or surcharge).\n15. The accountant concerned or his heirs, the local authority or public institution, the Government Commissioner attached to the regional audit office (who acts as State Counsel before the regional audit office and is the correspondent of Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit (procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pr\u00e8s la Cour des Comptes) \u2013 Article L. 212-10 of the Financial Judicature Code), or Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit may appeal to the Court of Audit against any final judgment delivered by the regional audit office (Articles L. 111-1, L. 211-1, L. 243-1 and R. 243-1 et seq. of the Financial Judicature Code).\n16. The appeal is either lodged with the registry of the regional audit office, and an acknowledgment of receipt obtained, or sent to the registry by registered post with recorded delivery. Fifteen days after registration of the appeal, the Government Commissioner communicates it to the other persons having a right of appeal and simultaneously sends a copy to Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit (Article R. 243-8 of the Financial Judicature Code). The parties have one month from the transmission of the appeal in which to consult all the documents annexed to the appeal at the registry of the regional audit office and to lodge defence pleadings. During the same period State Counsel (the Government Commissioner) can submit observations. A copy of the pleadings and observations is served by State Counsel on the appellant and the other parties, who may, within one month of transmission, lodge a reply, which is itself sent to the parties, and to which a rejoinder can be lodged within fifteen days. State Counsel may submit observations on the defence pleadings and replies lodged by the various parties. These observations are served on the interested parties (Article R. 243-9 of the Financial Judicature Code). If further documents are added to the file, the appellant and the other parties have fifteen days in which to inspect them and, if they wish, file their observations with the registry of the regional audit office (Article R. 243-10 of the Financial Judicature Code).\nOnce these time-limits have expired, State Counsel (the Government Commissioner) sends the appeal, a copy of the judgment, the documents produced by the appellant and the pleadings and documents produced by the other parties and the observations by State Counsel to Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit (Article R. 243-11 of the Financial Judicature Code; since Decree no. 2002-1201 of 27 September 2002 came into force, the Government Commissioner notifies the appellant and the other parties that these documents have been sent to Principal State Counsel).\n(b) Features of the proceedings in the Court of Audit on an appeal from a judgment of a regional audit office levying a surcharge against a public accountant\n17. Principal State Counsel at the Court of Audit sends the appeal file to the Court of Audit (Article R. 112-8, paragraph 4, of the Financial Judicature Code) in a document which \u2013 the Government specify \u2013 \u201cis customarily referred to as an \u2018application\u2019 but does not imply any personal initiative on the part of Principal State Counsel (Conseil d\u2019Etat, 6 January 1995, Gouaz\u00e9; 27 October 2000, Mme Desvignes)\u201d.\nThe reporting judge at the court prepares his report on the basis of the appeal file.\nReports relating, inter alia, to surcharges and appeals against judgments delivered by regional audit offices have to be sent to Principal State Counsel, who makes written submissions on them (Article R. 112-8, paragraph 5, of the Financial Judicature Code); in doing so, he gives an opinion that the bench is free to follow or reject. He may attend the sessions of the divisions or sections and submit oral observations, but does not take part in the deliberations (Decree no. 2002-1201 of 27 September 2002, codified in Article R. 112-8 in fine of the Financial Judicature Code; the Government indicated that, prior to the entry into force of that decree, this principle had already been hallowed by usage).\nIn the light of the appeal file, the report and the submissions of Principal State Counsel, the counter-reporting judge \u2013 who, according to the Government, sits on the bench hearing the appeal \u2013 expresses orally, during", "001-73360": "\ufeff\nFORMER\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DICKSON v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving regard to the observations of the parties,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n13. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by Section 47 of the Prison Act, 1952, which, in so far as material, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein...\u201d\n14. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n15. The long standing policy of the prison service, set out above in the letter of Secretary of State of 28 May 2003 was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 of age. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n16. They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The Government argued that the policy was justified: (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single parent families.\n17. The Court of Appeal considered, while the first reason did no more than restate the policy, the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy. In giving judgment for the court, Lord Phillips said (at paragraphs 44 ff):\n\u201c[The Secretary of State] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy. I agree. Penal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system.\nFurthermore, [the applicants\u2019] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201cjustified\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustified public concern\u201d. A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern...\n...

Elens-Passos, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n##### 1. Preventive measures, including detention on remand\n22. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so\u2011called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (por\u0119czenie maj\u0105tkowe), police supervision (doz\u00f3r policji), guarantee by a responsible person (por\u0119czenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a social entity (por\u0119czenie spo\u0142eczne), temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskar\u017conego w okre\u015blonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci) and prohibition to leave the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:\n\u201cPreventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused\u2019s committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d\nArticle 258 lists grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand may be imposed if:\n(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];\n(2) there is a justified fear that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co\u2011defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means;\n2. If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years\u2019 imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years\u2019 imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.\u201d\nThe Code sets out the margin of discretion as to the continuation of a specific preventive measure. Article 257 reads, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.\u201d\nArticle 259, in its relevant part, read:\n\u201c1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand shall be lifted, in particular if depriving an accused of his liberty would:\n(1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or\n(2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.\u201d\nThe 1997 Code not only sets out maximum statutory time-limits for detention on remand but also, in Article ", "001-75454": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF GRANT v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\nSocial security, employment and pensions\n16. A transsexual continues to be recorded for social security, National Insurance and employment purposes as being of the sex recorded at birth.\n(a) National Insurance\n17. The DSS registers every British citizen for National Insurance (NI) purposes on the basis of the information in their birth certificate. Non-British citizens who wish to register for NI in the United Kingdom may use their passport or identification card as evidence of identity if a birth certificate is unavailable.\n18. The DSS allocates every person registered for NI with a unique NI number. The NI number has a standard format consisting of two letters followed by three pairs of numbers and a further letter. It contains no indication in itself of the holder\u2019s sex or of any other personal information. The NI number is used to identify each person with an NI account (there are at present approximately 60 million individual NI accounts). The DSS is thereby able to record details of all NI contributions paid into the account during the NI account-holder\u2019s life and to monitor each person\u2019s liabilities, contributions and entitlement to benefits accurately. New numbers may in exceptional cases be issued to persons, for example, under the witness protection scheme or to protect the identity of child offenders.\n19. NI contributions are made by way of deduction from an employee\u2019s pay by the employer and then by payment to the Inland Revenue (for onward transmission to the DSS). At present employers will make such deductions for a female employee until she reaches the pensionable age of 60 and for a male employee until he reaches the pensionable age of 65. The DSS operates a policy for male-to-female transsexuals whereby they may enter into an undertaking with the DSS to pay direct to the DSS any NI contributions due after the transsexual has reached the age of 60 which have ceased to be deducted by the employer in the belief that the employee is female. In the case of female-to-male transsexuals, any deductions which are made by an employer after the age of 60 may be reclaimed directly from the DSS by the employee.\n20.

Until 1 September 1998 censorship of correspondence was effected under the provisions of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (Kodeks karny wykonawczy) of 19 April 1969 (\u201cthe 1969 Code\u201d). The Code is no longer in force. On 1 September 1998 it was repealed and replaced by the \u201cnew\u201d Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 6 June 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Code\u201d).\n#### A. Provisions in force before 1 September 1998\n22. Pursuant to Article 89 \u00a7 2 of the 1969 Code, all correspondence of a detainee was, as a rule, censored, unless a prosecutor or a court decided otherwise. There was no legal means whereby a detainee could appeal against or, in any other way, contest the censorship of his correspondence or the scope of that measure (cf. Niedba\u0142a v. Poland, no. 27915/95, judgment of 4 July 2000, \u00a7\u00a7 33-36).\n#### B. Provisions in force since 1 September 1998\n23.

The applicant complained of the prohibition of an assembly he had intended to hold on All Saints\u2019 Day in commemoration of the Salzburg Jews murdered by the SS during the Second World War. He relied in the first place on Article 11 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\n2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n26. The applicant agreed with the position taken by the Constitutional Court, namely that the prohibition of the assembly in question could not be justified solely by the aim of protecting the meeting of Comradeship IV against disturbances.\n27. In his submission, the prohibition had not been justified for any other reasons either. He asserted that the position taken by the authorities in the domestic proceedings and by the Government before the Court disregarded the fact that the purpose of the meeting was to express an opinion, namely to remind the public of the crimes c", "001-76303": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SAADI v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201cpending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter\u201d (Schedule 2, paragraph 16). Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention. It is a form of licensed consent to enter the United Kingdom which may be subjected to conditions, including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person\u2019s residence, employment or occupation (Schedule 2, paragraph 21).\n18. In general (that is, in cases other than those involving Oakington), the SSHD\u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding.\n19. On 16 March 2000 Barbara Roche MP, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new Oakington Reception Centre. Oakington asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018quickly\u2019, including those which may be certified as being \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019. To assist immigration officers, lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at Oakington could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with. It was said that Oakington would strengthen the ability of the Home Office to deal quickly with asylum applications.\n20. Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for Oakington detention. Cases in which detention at Oakington would not be suitable included the following:\n- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors;\n- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers;\n- cases in which there was a dispute as to age;\n- disabled applicants;\n- persons with special medical needs;\n- cases involving disputes as to nationality; and\n- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative.\n21. In addition, all persons believed to be at risk of absconding (from Oakington) were not deemed suitable for detention at Oakington.\n22. The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, social visits room and a religious observance room. The following description was used in the present case:\n\u201cAll of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant, medical centre, social visits room, religious observance and recreation. The practical operation and facilities at Oakington are, however, very different from other detention centres. In particular, there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security, reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications. The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space. Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although, in the interests of privacy and safety, there are two areas where only females and families may go.\u201d\n23.

There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A.

The applicant relied on the judgments in Van K\u00fcck v. Germany (no. 35968/97, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2003\u2011VII), Pretty v. the United Kingdom (no. 2346/02, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2002\u2011III), Mikuli\u0107 v.

He submitted that the right to know one\u2019s parentage lay at the heart of the right to respect for private life.\n24. The Court must determine whether the right asserted by the applicant falls within the scope of the concept of \u201crespect\u201d for \u201cprivate and family life\u201d set forth in Article 8.\n25. The Court has held on numerous occasions that paternity proceedings fall within the scope of Article 8 (see Mikuli\u0107, cited above, \u00a7 51).

Preventive measures, including detention on remand\n18.

The other measures are bail (por\u0119czenie maj\u0105tkowe), police supervision (doz\u00f3r policji), guarantee by a responsible person (por\u0119czenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a social entity (por\u0119czenie spo\u0142eczne), temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskar\u017conego w okre\u015blonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci) and prohibition on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:\n\u201cPreventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused committing another serious offence; they may be imposed only if evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d\n19. Article 258 lists grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand may be imposed if:\n(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];\n(2) there is a justified fear that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co-defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means;\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. National Insurance\n11. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory national insurance (\u201cNI\u201d) contributions into the National Insurance Fund (NIF). This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n12. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NI scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NI contributions fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paras. 25-26).\n13. Primary Class 1 contributions to NI cease to be payable on attainment of the State retirement age (section 6(3) of the SSCBA).\n14. The NIF is currently the sole source of funding for payment of state retirement pensions as well as a number of other benefits, including IB.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26).\n16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%.\n17.

For these reasons, the Government contested the right of the widow to continue the proceedings which her deceased husband had instituted before the Court.\n18. The Court observes that the applicant's case concerns his complaints under Article 6 of the Convention about the unfairness and the length of proceedings which his first wife had instituted before the German social courts and which the applicant had continued after her death. In view of its own case-law (see, X v. France, judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234\u2011C, p. 89, \u00a7 26; Anne-Marie Andersson v.

Italy, judgment of 27 February 1992, Series A no. 228\u2011F, \u00a7 2), the Court accepts that, as the deceased applicant's wife, Mrs Pauline Klasen has sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case.\n### II.

Article 3 provides:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n31. The Government asked the Court to find this complaint manifestly ill-founded.\n32. The Court finds that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaint. In particular, there is no evidence that the applicant, who had his eighteenth birthday one week after the trial had begun, was subjected to any treatment in the procedure or conduct of the court-martial that attained the minimum level of severity required under Article 3 (cf. T. v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 24724/94, ECHR 1999, \u00a7\u00a7 60-78).

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze).

Article 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:\n\u201cPreventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused\u2019s committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d\n19.

The relevant rules are contained in the Civil Servants Act. In the version in force at the material time it provided as follows.\n#### A. Proceedings concerning the transfer of civil servants\n21. Section 38 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Servants Act (Beamten-Dienstrechtsgesetz) defines the transfer (Versetzung) of a civil servant as permanent assignment to another department.\n22. Under section 40 \u00a7 2 the recall (Abberufung) of a civil servant is equivalent to a transfer inter alia when the new assignment has not at least the same grade as the former post.\n23. According to section 38 \u00a7 2 a transfer can be ordered ex officio in case of important official interest.\n24. Under section 38 \u00a7 7a the transfer is to be ordered by decision. The concerned civil servant can appeal against this decision. His appeal does not have suspensive effect on the decision.\n25. Section 121 of the Salaries Act (Gehaltsgesetz) provides that a civil servant is entitled to an extra duties allowances (Verwendungszulage) if he permanently has a considerable level of responsibility for the accomplishment of tasks of general administration and if this level of responsibility exceeds the one which is normally connected with a position in an equal grade.\n26. Pursuant to section 41a \u00a7 6 an appeal will be decided upon by the Appeals Commission (Berufungskommission) established at the Ministry for Public Service and Sport (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliche Leistung und Sport).\n27.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d)\n21. Widow\u2019s bereavement allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) was governed by section 262(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which provided:\n\u201cWhere a married man whose wife is living with him dies, his widow shall be entitled \u2013\n(a) for the year of assessment in which the death occurs, to an income tax reduction calculated by reference to an amount equal to the amount specified in section 257A(1) for that year, and\n(b) (unless she marries again before the beginning of it) for the next following year of assessment, to an income tax reduction calculated by reference to an amount equal to the amount specified in section 257A(1) for that year.\u201d\nA widow had six years from the end of the tax year in which her husband died to claim the allowance.\n22. WBA was introduced by the Finance Act 1980, at a time when married couples were taxed as a single entity, with the man receiving an allowance in respect of his wife\u2019s earnings (the married man\u2019s allowance: \u201cMMA\u201d). When a married man was widowed, he could continue to claim MMA in the year of his wife\u2019s death. The aim of WBA was to enable widowed women to claim the equivalent of the MMA in the year of bereavement, rather than being restricted to a single person\u2019s allowance (\u201cSPA\u201d).\n23. Independent taxation of married men and women was introduced from 1990/91. Thereafter each married partner was entitled to claim a personal allowance, although the husband retained the right to claim a married couples allowance (\u201cMCA\u201d), which was the difference between the old MMA and the SPA.\n24. With effect from 1993/94 a married woman became entitled (subject to certain conditions) for the first time to share the MCA with her husband, or the couple together could elect that the wife could set the full amount of the MCA against her income. From 1994 the Government began successively to reduce the value of WBA and MCA, so that the WBA was worth a maximum of GBP 285 in 1998/99 and GBP 197 in 1999/2000.\n25. Section 34 of the Finance Act 1999 abolished WBA in relation to deaths occurring on or after 6 April 2000.\n#### B. The House of Lords\u2019 judgment in Wilkinson\n26. The question whether a claimant who had been refused widow\u2019s bereavement allowance after 2 October 2000 on the basis of his male sex could have the decision overturned under the Human Rights Act 1998 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) was examined by the House of Lords in R. v. Her Majesty\u2019s Commissioners of Inland Revenue ex parte Wilkinson [2005] UKHL 30. The IR accepted that the WBA fell within the scope of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, did not attempt to justify the difference in treatment between male and female bereaved spouses and admitted that the refusal of allowances to widowers was a breach of their Convention rights. However, the IR argued\u2014and the House of Lords accepted\u2014that it had not been unlawful under the Act for the IR to refuse to grant the WBA to men because it would have been contrary to primary legislation so to do (section 6(2)(b) of the Act).\n27.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 September and 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance tax\n12. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person's property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 275,000 for transfers between 5 April 2005 and 5 April 2006; GBP 285,000 for transfers during the tax year 2006-2007; and GBP 300,000 for 2007-2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n13. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the tax-payer's election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (1984 Act, section 227(1)-(4)).\n14. Section 18(1) of the 1984 Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005, this exemption was extended to a deceased's \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d)\n15. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n16. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n17. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The 2004 Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering inter alia pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n18. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was passed in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had co-habited for at least 12 years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n19. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour Peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Caithlin [the Conservative Peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times\u2014at Second Reading and in Grand Committee\u2014and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, Liberal Democrat Peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith MP, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill\u2014granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible ", "001-78429": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DEPA v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended the disciplinary and court-martial procedures regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955. References below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to the Army Act 1955 as amended. The statutory disciplinary provisions applicable to armed forces personnel are contained in the above-listed three \u201cservice discipline Acts\u201d. Each Act specifies, in virtually identical terms, the offences for which persons subject to that Act can be tried and the punishments applicable. Persons subject to armed forces law are thereby subjected to a common code of offences and punishments.\n#### A. The Offence\n20. The offences triable under the 1955 Act include misconduct in action; offences by or in relation to sentries, person on watch etc; failure to attend for, neglect of, duty; looting; mutiny and related offences; insubordinate behaviour; disobedience of a lawful command or standing order; desertion, absence without leave and related offences; malingering, drunkenness, disorderly conduct and fighting; refusal to submit to drug testing; false statements on entry or enlistment; offences harmful to morale; scandalous or disgraceful behaviour; ill-treatment of persons of inferior rank and conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (see sections 24-68 of the 1955 Act).\n21. In addition to the above, any person subject to armed forces law who commits a civilian offence (any act punishable by the laws of England) is also guilty of an offence against the service discipline Acts (section 70 of the 1955 Act).\n22. Section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cAny person subject to military law who - ...\n(b) uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer\nshall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.\u201d\n#### B.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 December 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n##### 1. Relevant provisions of the Constitution\n9. Article 45 of the Constitution, insofar as relevant, reads:\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court. ...\u201d\n2. Provisions on judicial impartiality in the Code of Civil Procedure of 1964 and relevant case-law\n10. Article 48 reads in its relevant part:\n\u201c\u00a7 1. A judge is ex lege excluded from dealing with the case: (...)\n5) in cases where he participated in a contested decision of a lower instance.\u201d\n11. The Supreme Court decision of 22 August 1974 (II CZ 160/74) reads in its relevant part:\n\u201cA judge who participated in a judgment is not excluded from giving subsequent decisions in the course of so-called \u201cinter-instance proceedings\u201d.\n12. The Supreme Court decision of 3 October 2001 (V CZ 162/01) states, inter alia, that Article 3933 of the Code of Civil Procedure sets out formal requirements which a cassation appeal has to satisfy. It is for the second-instance court to examine whether these requirements have been met.\nThe provisions of the Code determine when a judge is ex lege excluded from dealing with the case. It does not follow from these provisions that a judge who has given a second-instance judgment is to be excluded from participation in a subsequent examination of whether a cassation appeal complies with the formal requirements provided for by the Code.\n13. The Supreme Court reached the same conclusion in its decision of 22 April 2002 (IPZ 21/01).

Mandatory Drugs\u2019 Testing (\u201cMDT\u201d)\n27. MDT is permitted by section 16A(1) of the Prison Act 1952 (as amended in 1994). Section 16A(2) allows the request for a sample of any other description specified in the authorisation, not being an intimate sample, instead of or in addition to a urine sample.\n28. Rule 50 of the Prison Rules 1999 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) This rule applies where an officer, acting under the powers conferred by section 16A of the Prison Act 1952 (power to test prisoners for drugs), requires a prisoner to provide a sample for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has any controlled drug in his body.\n(2) In this rule \u201csample\u201d means a sample of urine or any other description of sample specified in the authorisation by the governor for the purposes of section 16A of the Prison Act 1952.\n(3) When requiring a prisoner to provide a sample, an officer shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, inform the prisoner:\n(a) that he is being required to provide a sample in accordance with section 16A of the Prison Act 1952; and\n(b) that a refusal to provide a sample may lead to disciplinary proceedings being brought against him.\n(4) An officer shall require a prisoner to provide a fresh sample, free from any adulteration.\n(5) An officer requiring a sample shall make such arrangements and give the prisoner such instructions for it", "001-79053": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF SOLMAZ v.

Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n21. The Government maintained that the applicant's detention had been reviewed at regular intervals. However, in view of the seriousness of the charges against him and the evidence in the case file, the court had had to extend his detention pending trial.\n22.

The Government argued that the Austrian courts' injunction did not constitute an interference with the applicant association's rights within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention. They submitted in that regard that Article 10 did not protect artistic freedom as such but only provided protection to artists who intended to contribute through their work to a public discussion of political or cultural matters. The present reproduction of public figures in \u201cgroup sexual situations\u201d could, however, hardly be regarded as a statement of opinion contributing to a cultural or political debate.\n23. In the alternative, the Government argued that the interference at issue had been lawful and had served the legitimate aim of protecting morals and the reputation and rights of others.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006 and 16 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Freedom of association\n16. Freedom of association is guaranteed in the Swedish constitution. Chapter 2, section 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is guaranteed:\n1. freedom of expression: the freedom to communicate information and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations or in any other way; ...\n5. freedom of association: the freedom to unite with others for public or private purposes; ...\u201d\nChapter 2, section 2 protects, inter alia, the negative aspect of freedom of association. It reads:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is protected against coercion to divulge an opinion in a political, religious, cultural or other such connection. In relation to the public administration, he is furthermore protected against coercion to participate in a meeting for the formation of opinion or in a demonstration or other manifestation of opinion, or to belong to a political association, religious congregation or other association for opinions referred to in the first sentence.\u201d\n17. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work (Lag om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet, SFS 1976:580, hereinafter \u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) guarantees the right of employers and employees to form, belong to and work for labour market organisations. The right of association is further protected by section 8, which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it.\n#### B. The relationship between employers and employees\n18. Section 10 of the 1976 Act gives employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees. It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees, who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions.\n19. Under section 26 of the 1976 Act, a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s organisations but also on their members, i.e. companies and individual workers. Moreover, in practice, the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect. This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise.\n20. Under section 27 of the 1976 Act, an employer and an employee cannot conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound. This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void. While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers. Consequently, while the contracts in question remain valid, the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union.\n#### C. The monitoring system\n21. Monitoring of wages for hourly work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch. It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union\u2019s representatives to the employer. If a mistake is discovered, clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter. In some cases, formal negotiations are required.\n22. Under the terms of the Construction Agreement, the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work. The fee \u2013 1.5% of the employee\u2019s wages \u2013 is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual wor", "001-79398": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KRZYCH AND GURBIERZ v.

The relevant domestic law concerning the details of this transition and its legal framework, such as the German Unification Treaty and the laws on the transfer of pension rights, are reproduced in the case of Adam and others v. Germany ((dec.) no. 290/03, 1 September 2005).\n##### 2. Case-load of the Federal Constitutional Court between 1999 and 2002\n20. According to the information submitted by the Government, the Federal Constitutional Court had to face a heavy case-load after the German reunification. They presented a list of the fifty major decisions taken by the first chamber (Senat) of the Federal Constitutional Court between March 1999 and July 2002. Out of these cases, approximately ten concerned issues related to the German reunification as such (e.g. complaints related to the expropriation, usufructuary rights and restitution of property and the transfer of pensions). The other decisions concerned regular constitutional questions such as the surveillance of telecommunications, the protection of private life (see decision of the Federal Constitutional Court no. 1 BvR 653/96; and Von Hannover v. Germany, no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004\u2011VI), issues related to the social law and family law as well as the restricted right of audience (Singularzulassung) before German Appeals Courts (see decision of the Federal Constitutional Court no. 1 BvR 335/97; and Wendenburg and Others v.

Relevant constitutional provisions\n13. Article 41 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cInviolability and liberty of the person shall be afforded to everyone. Any deprivation or limitation of liberty may be imposed only in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down by statute.\u201d\n#### B. Conditional release of a person serving a prison sentence\n14. Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the 1997 Criminal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cThe court may conditionally release a person serving a prison sentence from serving the remainder of that sentence only when his/her behaviour, characteristics, personal circumstances and way of life prior to the commission of the offence, the circumstances in which the offence was committed and his/her behaviour following the commission of the offence and while serving a sentence, would justify a conclusion that, following [conditional] release, the person would abide by the law and, in particular, would not re-offend.\u201d\nArticle 78 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the Criminal Code prescribes the minimum prison term, depending on the type of sentence and offender, which must be served before a convicted person may apply for conditional release. However, the decision to grant conditional release is left to the discretion of the court, which must be satisfied that the conditions laid down in Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code are met.\n#### C.

Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 15 February 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Relevant provisions of the Constitution\n20. Article 45 of the Constitution, insofar as relevant, reads:\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court. ...\u201d\n21. Article 17 of the Constitution, insofar as relevant, reads:\n\u201cBy means of a statute, associations may be created within a profession in which the public repose confidence, and such professional associations shall concern themselves with the proper practice of such professions in accordance with, and for the purpose of protecting, public interest.\u201d\n#### B. Legal aid\n22. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a court should give all necessary procedural instructions to a party acting without a lawyer and, in particular should indicate the consequences of that party's acts or failures to act.\n23. Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family's standard of living.\n24. Pursuant to Article 117 of the Code, persons exempted from the court fees may request that legal aid be granted to them. The court will then request the relevant District Bar Association or the District Chamber of Legal Advisers to assign an advocate or a legal adviser to the claimant's case.\n#### C. The cassation appeal\n25. At the material time, a party to civil proceedings could lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a judicial decision of a second-instance court which terminated the proceedings.\n26. Under Article 393 4 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within one month from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned. Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser would be rejected.\n27. Article 393 1 of the Code as applicable at that time listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged. It read as follows:\n\u201cThe cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds:\n1) a breach of substantive law by its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application;\n2) a breach of procedural provisions, if that defect could significantly affect the outcome of the case.\u201d\n28. Article 393 3 specified the requirements of a cassation appeal. It read in its relevant part:\n\u201c\u00a7 1. A cassation appeal should include:\n1) an indication of the decision under appeal together with information as to whether the appeal is lodged against this decision in its entirety or in part only;\n2) an indication of the grounds for the cassation appeal;\n3) arguments showing that its examination would be justified;\n4) a motion to have the decision under appeal quashed or amended, specifying also the scope of the motion.\u201d\n29. Article 393 4 read as follows:\n\u201cA second-instance court rejects in a hearing held in camera a cassation appeal lodged after a prescribed time-limit or which is inadmissible on other grounds (...).\u201d\n30. The reasons justifying the examination of a cassation appeal by the Supreme Court could be inferred a contrario from Article 393 of the Civil Code of Procedure which, as applicable at that time, read, in its relevant part:\n\u201c1. The Supreme Court may refuse to entertain the cassation appeal, if:\ni) there is no appearance of any significant legal issue in the case,\nii) there is no need for the interpretation of provisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the courts' case law,\niii) the appeal is manifestly ill-founded.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the judicial decision challenged manifestly breached the law or where the proceedings are invalid in law.\u201d\n#### D. Judgment of the Constitutional Court of 31 March 2005\n31. In its judgment of 31 March 2005 the Constitutional Court examined a number of constitutional complaints in which the complainants argued essentially about certain provisions of Article 393 of the Code of Civil Procedure, also insofar as they regulated the conditions that cassation appeals had to comply with.\n32. The Court observed, inter alia, that certain terms describing the conditions which cassation appeals had to meet under Article 393 et seq. of the Code (\u201cimportant legal issue\u201d, \u201cprovisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the courts' case law\u201d, \u201carguments showing that examination of the cassation appeal would be justified\u201d) were drafted in the broadest terms. It noted that the judicial practice regarding their application had given rise to serious interpretational difficulties and discrepancies in the case\u2011law of the Polish courts.\n#### E. Relevant provisions of the Bar Act\n33. Article 1 of the Bar Act of 1982, as amended, reads, insofar as relevant:\n\u201c1. The Bar is established to provide legal assistance, co-operate in protecting a person's rights and freedoms as well as to formulate and apply the law.\n2. The Bar is organized as a self-governing association.\n3", "001-79889": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF MASLOV v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained about the residence prohibition against him and about his subsequent expulsion to Bulgaria. He relied on Article 8 of the Convention which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n23. The applicant alleged that the impugned residence prohibition was not in accordance with the law, as the Administrative Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 38 \u00a7 1 (4) of the 1997 Aliens Act distinguished arbitrarily between the group of second generation immigrants who came to Austria before the age of three, who may not be subject to a residence prohibition, and other second generation immigrants like him, who still came at pre-school age but may be subject to a residence prohibition.\n24. In the applicant\u2019s contention, the residence prohibition against him was disproportionate. He pointed out in particular that he was a second generation immigrant, having lived in Austria from the age of six. He had received his entire schooling there and had developed all his social, cultural and linguistic ties there, while he had no links with Bulgaria, except his nationality and two brief periods of holidays he spent there. He had no relatives or friends there and did not speak or write Bulgarian. Moreover, the applicant criticised that the impugned decisions did not take account of various factors speaking in his favour: he had committed the offences at issue at the age of 14 and 15 respectively, that is during a difficult period of adolescence and had only played a subordinate role in their commission. Later, he had not commit", "001-79914": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF \u00d6ZTUN\u00c7 v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Law of privacy\n18. At the relevant time there was no general right to privacy in English law.\n19. Since the implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October 2000, the courts have been required to read and give effect to primary legislation in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights so far as possible. The Act also made it unlawful for any public authority, including a court, to act in a manner which is incompatible with a Convention right unless required to do so by primary legislation, thus providing for the development of the common law in accordance with Convention rights. In the case of Douglas v. Hello! Ltd ([2001] 2 WLR 992), Lord Justice Sedley indicated that he was prepared to find that there was a qualified right to privacy under English law, but the Court of Appeal did not rule on the point.\n20. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (\u201cthe 2000 Act\u201d) provided for the regulation of, inter alia, interception of communications. The Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) Regulations 2000 were promulgated under the 2000 Act and came into force on 24 October 2000. The Regulations set out the circumstances in which employers could record or monitor employees\u2019 communications (such as e-mail or telephone) without the consent of either the employee or the other party to the communication. Employers were required to take reasonable steps to inform employees that their communications might be intercepted.\n#### B. Contractual damages for breach of trust and confidence by employer\n21.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so\u2011called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze). Article 249 \u00a7 5 provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand.\n23. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court's judgments in Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000\u2011XI, and Celejewski v.

Rules relating to means of controlling correspondence of persons involved in criminal proceedings are set out in the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences (Kodeks karny wykonawczy) (\u201cthe 1997 Code\u201d) which entered into force on 1 September 1998. Article 102 (11) of the 1997 Code provides that convicted persons are entitled to uncensored correspondence with the State authorities and with the Ombudsman. The relevant part of Article 103 \u00a7 1 of the Code provides as follows:\n\u201cConvicts (...) have a right to lodge complaints with institutions established by international treaties ratified by the Republic of Poland concerning the protection of human rights.

Widow's Pensions 1925-2001\n15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30:\n\u201c[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance: 'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.\nThe secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons' and widows' pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at", "001-80520": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF EMMER-REISSIG v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Road traffic legislation\n25. Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (\u201cthe 1988 Act\u201d) deals with the duty to give information of a driver of a vehicle in certain circumstances. Subsection (1) refers to the traffic offences to which the section applies. They include parking on a cycle track (under section 21 of the 1988 Act) and causing death by reckless driving (section 1), offences under a number of other provisions, including speeding, and manslaughter by the driver of a motor vehicle.\nSubsection 2 provides:\n\u201cWhere the driver of a vehicle is alleged to be guilty of an offence to which this section applies \u2013\n(a) the person keeping the vehicle shall give such information as to the identity of the driver as he may be required to give by or on behalf of a chief officer of police, and\n(b) any other person shall if required as stated above give any information which it is in his power to give and may lead to identification of the driver.\u201d\nSubsection 3 provides:\n\u201cSubject to the following provisions, a person who fails to comply with a requirement under subsection (2) above shall be guilty of an offence.\u201d\nSubsection 4 provides:\n\u201cA person shall not be guilty of an offence by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) above if he shows that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who the driver of the vehicle was.\u201d\n26. A person guilty of an offence under subsection 3 can be disqualified or have his licence endorsed with three penalty points; he may also be fined up to level three on the standard scale, that is, GBP 1,000.\n27. Section 12(1) of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 provides that on summary trial for a relevant offence, including speeding offences, a statement in writing signed by the accused under section 172(2) of the 1988 Act that he was the driver of the vehicle on that occasion may be accepted as evidence of that fact.\n#### B. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984\n28. Section 76 provides\n\u201c(1) In any proceedings a confession made by an accused person may be given in evidence against him in so far as it is relevant to any matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in pursuance of this section;\n(2) If, in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is represented to the court that the confession was or may have been obtained \u2013\n(a) by oppression of the person who made it; or\n(b) in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the circumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any confession which might be made by him in consequence thereof,\nthe court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidence against him except in so far as the prosecution proves to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the confession (notwithstanding that it may be true) was not obtained as aforesaid.\n...\u201d\n29. Section 78(1) provides:\n\u201cIn any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\u201d\n#### C. Relevant domestic case-law\n30. In Brown v. Stott, cited above, the Privy Council considered the case of a woman arrested for shoplifting in the vicinity of a car that appeared to be hers. She was breathalysed and tested positive for alcohol consumption. With a view to ascertaining whether she had been guilty of driving her car while under the influence of alcohol (contrary to section 5 of the 1988 Act), the police served her with a section 172 notice. The Procurator Fiscal sought to use her answer that she had been driving as the basis for a prosecution for driving with excess alcohol. The High Court of Justiciary allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal, finding that the prosecution could not rely on evidence of the admission which she had been compelled to make.\n31. On appeal by the Procurator Fiscal, the Privy Council found that the use of the admission did not infringe the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, giving the leading judgment, held, inter alia:\n\u201cThe high incidence of death and injury on the roads caused by the misuse of motor vehicles is a very serious problem common to almost all developed societies. The need to address it in an effective way, for the benefit of the public, cannot be doubted. Among other ways in which democratic societies have sought to address it is by subjecting the use of motor vehicles to a regime of regulation and making provision for enforcement by identifying, prosecuting and punishing offending drivers. Materials ... incomplete though they are, reveal different responses to the problem of enforcement. Under some legal systems (Spain, Belgium and France are examples) the registered owner is presumed to be the driver guilty of minor traffic infractions unless he shows that some other person was driving at the relevant time or establishes some other ground of exoneration. There being a clear public interest in enforcement of road traffic legislation the crucial question in this case is whether section 172 represents a disproportionate response, or one that undermines a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, if an admission of being the driver is relied on at trial.\nI do not for my part consider that section 172, properly applied, does represent a disproportionate response to this serious social problem, nor do I think that reliance on the respondent\u2019s admission in the present case, would undermine her right to a fair trial. I reach that conclusion for a number of reasons.\n1. Section 172 provides for the putting of a single, simple question. The answer cannot of itself incriminate the suspect, since it is not without more an offence to drive a car. An admission of driving may, of course, as here, provide proof of a fact necessary to convict, but the section does not sanction prolonged questioning about facts alleged to give rise to criminal offences such as understandably was held to be objectionable in Saunders, and the penalty for declining to answer under the section is moderate and non-custodial. There is in the present case no suggestion of improper coercion or oppression such as might give rise to unreliable admissions and so contribute to a miscarriage of justice, and if there were evidence of such conduct the trial judge would have ample power to exclude evidence of the admission.\n2. While the High Court was entitled to distinguish ... between the giving of an answer under section 172 and the provision of physical samples, and had the authority of the European Court in Saunders ... for doing so, this distinction should not in my opinion be pushed too far. It is true that the respondent\u2019s answer whether given orally or in writing would create new evidence which did not exist until she spoke or wrote. In contrast, it may be acknowledged, the percentage of alcohol in her blood was a fact, existing before she blew into the breathalyser machine. But the whole purpose of requiring her to blow into the machine (on pain of a criminal penalty if she refused) was to obtain evidence not available until she did so and the reading so obtained could, in all save exceptional circumstances, be enough to convict a driver of an offence ... [I]t is not easy to see why a requirement to answer a question is objectionable and a requirement to undergo a breath test is not. Yet no criticism is made of the requirement that the respondent undergo a breath test.\n3. All who own or drive motor cars know that by doing so they subject themselves to a regulatory regime. This regime is imposed not", "001-81368": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF RAFI\u0143SKA v.

Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 10 July 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. Rules on the impartiality of judges and jurors are set out in sections 106 to 108 of the Administration of Courts Act (domstolloven - Law of 13 August 1915 no. 5). In the present case, the national courts relied in particular on section 108, which reads:\nSection 108\n\u201cNor may a person sit as a judge or juror if there are other particular circumstances which are liable to weaken the confidence in his impartiality. This applies in particular if a party requests that he withdraws on this ground.\u201d\n20. The conditions for provisional detention were set out in Articles 171 and 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the relevant parts of which provided:\nArticle 171\n\u201cAny person who on reasonable ground is suspected of one or more acts which according to statute is or are punishable with more than 6 months' imprisonment, may be arrested if:\n1) there is reason to fear that he will evade prosecution or the execution of a sentence or other precautionary measures,\n2) there is an immediate risk that he will spoil the evidence in the case, e.g. by removing clues or influencing witnesses or accomplices,\n3) it is deemed to be necessary in order to prevent him from re-committing a criminal act punishable by ore than 6 months' imprisonment,\n4) he himself has requested it for reasons that are found to be satisfactory.\n...\u201d\nArticle 172\n\u201cWhen a person is suspected of\n###### (a) a crime punishable by imprisonment for 10 years or more, or of an attempt to commit such a crime, or\n###### (b) a criminal offence under Articles 228 (2), second alternative, see Article 232, Article 229 second alternative, see Article 232, or Article 229 third alternative, s/he may be arrested even if the conditions in Article 171 are not fulfilled, provided that s/he has made a confession or there are other circumstances which to a particularly high degree strengthen the suspicion. In the assessment emphasis shall be placed particularly on whether it would provoke the public's perceptions of justice or create insecurity if the suspect is at large. Any increase of the maximum penalty because of any repetition or concurrence of offences shall not be taken into account.\u201d\n21. The relationship between Article 172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and section 108 of the Administration of Court Act was dealt with by the Norwegian Supreme Court in a landmark judgment reported in Rt 1996-261, several passages of which were quoted in the Supreme Court's judgment in the present case (see paragraph 18 above, paragraph (15) of the Supreme Court's judgment).

Elens-Passos, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 October 2006 and 18 September 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Constitution\n16. Article 24 of the Constitution, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of conscience, religious belief and conviction.\n2. Acts of worship, religious services, and ceremonies shall be conducted freely, provided that they do not violate the provisions of Article 14.\n3. No one shall be compelled to worship, or to participate in religious ceremonies and rites, to reveal religious beliefs and convictions, or be blamed or accused because of his religious beliefs and convictions.\n4. Education and instruction in religion and ethics shall be conducted under State supervision and control. Instruction in religious culture and moral education shall be compulsory in the curricula of primary and secondary schools. Other religious education and instruction shall be subject to the individual's own desire, and in the case of minors, to the request of their legal representatives.\n5. No one shall be allowed to exploit or abuse religion or religious feelings, or things held sacred by religion, in any manner whatsoever, for the purpose of personal or political influence, or for even partially basing the fundamental, social, economic, political, and legal order of the State on religious tenets.\u201d\n#### B. The State Education Act (Law no. 1739)\n17. Section 12 of the State Education Act (Law no. 1739) provides:\n\u201cSecularism is the basis of Turkish state education. Religious culture and ethics shall be among the compulsory subjects taught in primary and upper secondary schools and in schools of an equivalent level.\u201d\n#### C. Decisions on exemptions and on the syllabus\n##### 1. Decision no. 1 of 9 July 1990 on exemptions\n18. On 9 July 1990 the Supreme Council for Education adopted a decision on religious culture and ethics classes and pupils who were entitled to exemption from them. It stated:\n\u201cFollowing the proposal by the Ministry of Education, pupils of Turkish nationality who belong to the Christian or Jewish religions and who attend primary and secondary schools, with the exception of schools for minorities, are not obliged to follow the classes in religious culture and ethics, provided they affirm their adherence to those religions. If, however, such pupils wish to attend such classes, they must submit a written request from their legal representative.\u201d\n19. At the hearing the Government explained that this exemption procedure could be extended to other religious or philosophical convictions, such as atheism, without however producing specific examples.\n2. The Turkish education system and decision no. 373 of 19 September 2000 on guidelines for classes in religious culture and ethics\n20. Since 1997 compulsory state education has lasted eight years (instead of the previous five) for children aged 6 to 14; the first five years correspond to primary school (1st to 5th grade) and the following three to secondary school (6th to 8th grade).\n21. In decision no. 373 of 19 September 2000, the Minister of Education approved the guidelines for classes in religious culture and ethics (taught in grades 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).\nThe principles adopted in this connection are as follows:\n\u201c... today, when intercultural influence is increasing, it has become necessary, in order to foster a culture of peace and a context of tolerance to know about other religions.\nFor this reason, the school syllabus...;\n... includes teaching [to the effect] that the aim of all religions is to educate upright individuals. [Religious instruction also aims to educate people] who are informed about the historical development of Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism, their main features and the content of their doctrine, and to be able to assess, using objective criteria, the position of Islam in relation to Judaism and Christianity...\n#### A. The principles to be observed during the teaching and learning experience...\n1. Always bear in mind the principle of secularism. There should be no infringement of freedom of religion, conscience, thought and expression.\n2. Emphasise that differences in religious understanding and practice are of value.\n3. Take advantage, in so far as possible, of pupils' feelings and behaviour in order to socialise them and to educate them as good citizens through religious and ethical knowledge.\n4.

The grant of bail in Northern Ireland is governed by common law rather than statute. There is a discretion to grant bail in any case but the court is obliged to pay regard to certain considerations before doing so and may not do so if satisfied of other matters. The grounds on which bail may be refused include: where there are good reasons for believing that the defendant will not turn up for his or her trial; where there is a serious likelihood that the defendant will interfere with witnesses or evidence or otherwise obstruct the course of justice; and when the defendant is likely to commit further offences if set at liberty. In deciding whether there are good reasons for believing that the defendant will not turn up for his or her trial, the relevant factors to be taken into account by the court include: the nature and seriousness of the alleged offence; the probable method of dealing with the defendant in the event of a conviction; and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n19. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by section 47 of the Prison Act 1952, the relevant parts of which provide as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons ... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein ...\u201d\n20. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No. 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n21. The Policy was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 years old. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n22. They sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Policy itself, rather than its application to their case, arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished the Policy from that concerning conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The government argued that the Policy was justified in that (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single-parent families. The High Court refused leave and the applicants appealed.\n23. The Court of Appeal (Lord Phillips delivering the main judgment) noted that the Secretary of State\u2019s decision pre-dated the incorporation of the Convention into English law and continued:\n\u201cIt is, however, his contention that English domestic law has at all times accorded with the Convention. Nor has he challenged the appellant\u2019s case that the requirements of the Convention provide a touchstone for judging the rationality of his decision and the policy pursuant to which it was reached. This is a sensible approach for what matters to the appellant is the extent of his rights today and the Secretary of State is also principally concerned with whether his policy complies with the provisions of the Convention, which now forms part of our law. In the light of this approach I propose first to consider the Strasbourg jurisprudence, then the relevant English domestic law before turning to consider whether the decision of the Secretary of State is in conflict with either.\u201d\n24. Having examined relevant Commission jurisprudence (no. 6564/74, Commission decision of 21 May 1975, Decisions and Reports (DR) 2, p. 105; no. 8166/78, Commission decision of 3 October 1978, DR 13, p. 241; Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Commission\u2019s report of 13 December 1979, DR 24, p. 5; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Commission\u2019s report of 10 July 1980, DR 24, p. 72; and E.L.H. and P.B.H. v. the United Kingdom, nos. 32094/96 and 32568/96, Commission decision of 22 October 1997, DR 91-A, p. 61), Lord Phillips summarised five Convention principles he considered thereby established:\n\u201c(i) The qualifications on the right to respect for family life that are recognised by Article 8(2) apply equally to the Article 12 rights.\n(ii) Imprisonment is incompatible with the exercise of conjugal rights and consequently involves an interference with the right to respect for family life under Article 8 and with the right to found a family under Article 12.\n(iii) This restriction is ordinarily justifiable under the provisions of Article 8(2).\n(iv) In exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to relax the imposition of detention in order to avoid a disproportionate interference with a human right.\n(v) There is no case which indicates that a prisoner is entitled to assert the right to found a family by the provision of semen for the purpose of artificially inseminating his wife.\u201d\n25. Lord Phillips went on to approve the reasons given to justify the restriction of artificial insemination facilities to exceptional circumstances.\nAs to the first justification, he agreed that the deprivation of the right to conceive was part and parcel of imprisonment and, indeed, that that statement did no more than restate the Policy in that it indicated that it was a \u201cdeliberate policy that the deprivation of liberty should ordinarily deprive the prisoner of the opportunity to beget children\u201d.\nOn the second justification, he considered that there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison. Lord Phillips agreed that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy:\n\u201cPenal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system. ... A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern. ... When considering the question of whether, in the ordinary course, prisoners should be accorded the facility to beget children while imprisoned I consider it legitimate to have regard to all the consequences of that particular policy option.\u201d\nAs regards the third justification which concerned the alleged disadvantage of single-parent families, he commented:\n\u201cI consider it legitimate, and indeed desirable, that the State should consider the implications of children being brought up in those circumstances when deciding whether or not to have a general policy of facilitating the artificial insemination of the wives of prisoners or of wives who are themselves prisoners.\u201d\n26. Lord Phillips then concluded:\n\u201cFor those reasons [the Mellors] failed to make out [the] case that the [Policy] ... is irrational. [The Mellors] accepted that there were in this case no exceptional circumstances, and", "001-83927": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF CENG\u0130Z POLAT v.

Maruste,\nMr J. Borrego Borrego,\nMrs R. Jaeger, judges,\nand Mrs C. Westerdiek, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 November 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n##### 1. Code of Criminal Procedure\n41. Sections 112 et seq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) concern detention on remand. Pursuant to section 112 \u00a7 1 of the Code, a defendant may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he has committed a criminal offence and if there are grounds for arresting him. Grounds for arrest will exist where certain facts warrant the conclusion that there is a risk of his absconding (section 112 \u00a7 2 no. 2) or of collusion (section 112 \u00a7 2 no. 3).\n42. According to section 114 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, detention on remand is ordered by a judge in a written arrest warrant. The arrest warrant names the accused, the offence of which he is strongly suspected, including the time and place of its commission, and the grounds for the arrest. Moreover, the facts establishing the grounds for the strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest must be set out in the arrest warrant unless national security would thereby be endangered.\n43. Under section 117 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, remand prisoners may ask at any time for judicial review (Haftpr\u00fcfung) of the decision to issue an arrest warrant or for the warrant to be suspended. They may lodge an appeal under section 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Haftbeschwerde) against a decision ordering their (continued) detention and a further appeal (weitere Beschwerde) against the Regional Court\u2019s decision on the appeal (section 310 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). If the appeal court considers the appeal against the (continued) detention to be well-founded, it will take a decision on the merits at the same time (section 309 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). However, according to the domestic courts\u2019 case-law, a detention order which does not comply with the duty to set out the grounds for suspecting the accused of an offence is not void, but merely defective in law. If, in such a case, the prosecution also refused access to the case file, the defective reasoning amounts to a refusal to hear representations from the defendant. In these circumstances, the court of appeal \u2013 by way of an exception to section 309 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 may remit the case to the district court (see Berlin Court of Appeal, no. 5 Ws 344/93, decision of 5 October 1993, Strafverteidiger (StV) 1994, pp. 318-319; compare also Karlsruhe Court of Appeal, no. 3 Ws 196/00, decision of 26 September 2000, StV 2001, pp. 118-120, to which the D\u00fcsseldorf Court of Appeal referred in the present case).\n44. Section 147 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that defence counsel is entitled to consult the files which have been or will be presented to the trial court, and to inspect the exhibits. Paragraph 2 of this provision allows access to part or all of the files or to the exhibits to be refused until the preliminary investigation has ended if it might otherwise be at risk. At no stage of the proceedings may defence counsel be refused access to records concerning the examination of the accused, acts in the judicial investigation at which defence counsel was or should have been allowed to be present or expert reports (section 147 \u00a7 3 of the said Code). Pending the termination of the preliminary investigation, it is for the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to decide whether to grant access to the files or not; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court (section 147 \u00a7 5). An accused who is in detention is entitled to seek judicial review of a decision of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to refuse access to the files (ibid.).\n##### 2. Provisions of the Basic Law\n45. According to Article 103 \u00a7 1 of the Basic Law every person involved in proceedings before a court is entitled to be heard by that court (Anspruch auf rechtliches Geh\u00f6r).\n46. Article 104 \u00a7 3 of the Basic Law provides that every person provisionally detained on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence must be brought before a judge no later than the day following his arrest; the judge must inform him of the reasons for the arrest, hear representations from him and give him an opportunity to raise objections. The judge must then, without delay, either issue a written arrest warrant setting out the grounds therefor or order the detainee\u2019s release.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE DETENTION ORDER AND THE SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS\n47. The applicant complained that the Court of Appeal had failed to quash the District Court\u2019s initial detention order of 25 July 2002 and to release him from prison even though it had found that the detention order was unlawful. By remitting the case to the District Court, the Court of Appeal had unnecessarily delayed the proceedings for judicial review of his detention order, which thus", "001-84034": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BISZTA v.

The family courts will follow this request if the other parent gives his or her consent or if it is to be expected that withdrawal of parental authority from one parent and transferral to the other best serves the child\u2019s interests.\n64. Pursuant to Section 1632 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code parental authority comprehends the right to order anybody \u2013 who unlawfully deprives the parents or one parent of their child \u2013 to have their child returned.\n65. According to section 1684, a child is entitled to have access to its parents; each parent is obliged to have contact with, and entitled to have access to, the child. The family courts can, however, restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child\u2019s welfare. A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if otherwise the child\u2019s well-being would be endangered (section 1684 \u00a7 4).\n66. Section 1666 provides that in cases of a danger to the child\u2019s welfare the court shall order the necessary measures. Pursuant to section 1666a \u00a7 1 measures which entail a separation of the child from the parents are only permitted if the danger cannot be averted by other means, including assistance by public authorities. The right of personal custody may only be withdrawn in its entirety if other measures proved unsuccessful or if it has to be assumed that they are insufficient to avert the danger.\n##### 2. The Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings\n67. Section 50 \u00a7 1 of the Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings (Gesetz \u00fcber die Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit) determines that in proceedings concerning a minor child, the Family Court may appoint a curator ad litem (Verfahrenspfleger) for that child to assist him or her if this should be necessary for the protection of his or her interests.\n68. Pursuant to section 50 \u00a7 2, the appointment of a curator ad litem is usually necessary where the child\u2019s interests conflict substantially with those of his legal representative, where the subject-matter of the proceedings concerns measures to be taken to avert a risk to the child\u2019s well-being involving a separation of the child from his or her family or the withdrawal of full parental authority or where the subject matter concerns the child\u2019s removal from the foster carer, spouse, partner or person entitled to access.\nTHE LAW\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Immigration Act 1971\n##### 1. Detention\n19. The Immigration Act 1971 (\u201cthe 1971 Act\u201d), Schedule 2, paragraph 2, entitles an immigration officer to examine any person arriving in the United Kingdom to determine whether he or she should be given leave to enter. Paragraph 16(1) provides:\n\u201cA person who may be required to submit to examination under paragraph 2 ... may be detained under the authority of an immigration officer pending his examination and pending a decision to give or refuse him leave to enter.\u201d\nParagraphs 8, 9 and 10 enable an immigration officer to remove those refused leave to enter or illegal entrants and paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 2 (as substituted by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 \u2013 \u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cIf there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a person is someone in respect of whom directions may be given under any of paragraphs 8 to 10 ... that person may be detained under the authority of an immigration officer pending \u2013\n(a) a decision whether or not to give such directions;\n(b) his removal in pursuance of such directions.\u201d\n##### 2. Temporary admission\n20. Paragraph 21(1) of Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act enables an immigration officer to grant temporary admission to the United Kingdom to any person liable to be detained. Paragraph 21(2) (as amended by the 1999 Act) provides:\n\u201cSo long as a person is at large in the United Kingdom by virtue of this paragraph, he shall be subject to such restrictions as to residence, as to his employment or occupation and as to reporting to the police or an immigration officer as may from time to time be notified to him in writing by an immigration officer.\u201d\nSub-paragraphs 2(A) to 2(E) give powers to the Secretary of State to make regulations placing residence restrictions on persons granted temporary admission.\n21. Section 11 of the 1971 Act provides as follows:\n\u201cA person arriving in the United Kingdom by ship or aircraft shall for purposes of this Act be deemed not to enter the United Kingdom unless and until he disembarks, and on disembarkation at a port shall further be deemed not to enter the United Kingdom so long as he remains in such area (if any) at the port as may be approved for this purpose by an immigration officer; and a person who has not otherwise entered the United Kingdom shall be deemed not to do so as long as he is detained, or temporarily admitted or released while liable to detention ...\u201d\nIn Szoma (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions [2005] UKHL 64, the House of Lords held that the purpose of section 11 of the 1971 Act was to exclude a person temporarily admitted from the rights available to those granted leave to enter, in particular the right to seek an extension of leave to remain, but that an alien granted temporary admission was nonetheless \u201clawfully present\u201d in the United Kingdom for the purposes of social security entitlement.\n#### B. Pre-Oakington policy on detention and temporary admission\n22. Before March 2000, when the opening of Oakington was announced (see paragraph 23 below), the Home Office policy on the use of detention was set out in a White Paper (policy paper) published in 1998 entitled \u201cFairer, Faster and Firmer \u2013 A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum\u201d (Cm 4018) in these terms (paragraph 12.3):\n\u201cThe government has decided that, whilst there is a presumption in favour of temporary admission or release, detention is normally justified in the following circumstances:\n\u2013 where there is a reasonable belief that the individual will fail to keep the terms of temporary admission or temporary release;\n\u2013 initially, to clarify a person\u2019s identity and the basis of their claim;\n\u2013 where removal is imminent. In particular, where there is a systematic attempt to breach the immigration control, detention is justified wherever one or more of those criteria is satisfied.\u201d\nIn paragraph 12.11 of the White Paper it was made clear that detention should be used for the shortest possible time and paragraph 12.7 required written reasons to be given at the time of detention.\n#### C. The Oakington Reception Centre\n23. On 16 March 2000 the Minister, Barbara Roche MP, announced a change of the above-mentioned policy in a written answer to a parliamentary question, as follows:\n\u201cOakington Reception Centre will strengthen our ability to deal quickly with asylum applications, many of which prove to be unfounded. In addition to the existing detention criteria, applicants will be detained at Oakington where it appears that their applications can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded. Oakington will consider applications from adults and families with children, for whom separate accommodation is being provided, but not from unaccompanied minors. Detention will initially be for a period of about seven days to enable applicants to be interviewed and an initial decision to be made. Legal advice will be available on site. If the claim cannot be decided in that period, the applicant will be granted temporary admission or, if necessary in line with existing criteria, moved to another place of detention. If the claim is refused, a decision about further detention will similarly be made in accordance with existing criteria. Thus, detention in this latter category of cases will normally be to effect removal or where it has become apparent that the person will fail to keep in contact with the Immigration Service.\u201d\n24. The decision whether an asylum claim is suitable for decision at Oakington is primarily based on the claimant\u2019s nationality. According to the Home Office\u2019s \u201cOperational Enforcement Manual\u201d, detention at Oakington should not be used for, inter alia, \u201cany case which does not appear to be one in which a quick decision can be reached\u201d; minors; disabled applicants; torture victims; and \u201cany person who gives reason to believe that they might not be suitable for the relaxed Oakington regime, including those who are considered likely to abscond\u201d.\n25. The detention centre is situated in former army barracks near Oakington, Cambridgeshire. It has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and social gathering and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, a visiting room and a religious-observance room. Applicants and their dependents are generally free to move about the site, but must eat and return to their rooms at fixed times. Male applicants are accommodated separately from women and children and cannot stay with their families overnight. Detainees must open their correspondence in front of the security guards and produce identification if requested, comply with roll-calls and other orders.\n### III.

The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which came into force on 27 January 1980, provides in Article 31:\nGeneral rule of interpretation\n\u201c1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n2.

In a judgment of 18 September 1985 (ATF 111 Ia 231) the Federal Court acknowledged more specifically that personal freedom also encompasses the feeling of parental devotion and, accordingly, the right of parents to object to any unjustified intervention in relation to the remains of a deceased family member.\n34. Article 13 of the new Federal Constitution protects the private sphere and is worded as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, their correspondence and their relations established by mail and telecommunications.\n2. Everyone has the right to be protected against the misuse of their personal data.\u201d\n35. Article 53, paragraph 2, of the old Federal Constitution provided for an obligation on the authorities to ensure that the dead received a decent burial:\n\u201cThe disposal of burial grounds is a concern of the civil authorities. They shall make sure that every deceased person can have a decent burial.\u201d\nThe new Constitution has not explicitly reproduced this provision.\n36.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Provisions concerning arrest\nArticle 244 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, stipulates that everyone who is arrested shall be immediately informed of the reasons for his arrest and of his rights.\nArticle 246 provides that everyone who is arrested shall be entitled to lodge an appeal with a court challenging the lawfulness of the arrest and the manner of its execution. Such appeals must be promptly transmitted to the competent District Court which is required to examine it speedily. In cases where the District Court has established that the arrest was unlawful or unwarranted, it must order the immediate release of the person concerned.\n#### B. Provisions concerning detention on remand\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure defines detention on remand as one of the so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (por\u0119czenie maj\u0105tkowe), police supervision (doz\u00f3r\npolicji), a guarantee by a responsible person (por\u0119czenie osoby godnej zaufania), a guarantee by a social entity (por\u0119czenie spo\u0142eczne), a temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskar\u017conego w okre\u015blonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci) and a ban on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for the imposition of preventive measures:\n\u201c1. Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, to prevent an accused's committing another serious offence; they may be imposed only if the evidence shows a significant probability that the accused has committed an offence.\u201d\nArticle 258 lists the grounds for detention on remand. It provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand may be imposed if:\n(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];\n(2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co-defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means;\n2. If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years' imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years' imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be established by the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.\u201d\nThe Code sets out the extent of the courts' discretion to continue a specific preventive measure. Article 257 reads, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.\u201d\nArticle 259 \u00a7 1 reads:\n\u201c1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand shall be lifted, in particular, if depriving an accused of his liberty would:\n(1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or\n(2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.\u201d\nArticle 259 \u00a7 3 provides:\n\u201cDetention on remand shall not be imposed if an offence attracts a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding one year.\u201d\nArticle 259 \u00a7 4 specifies that the rule provided for in Article 259 \u00a7 3 is not applicable when the accused attempts to evade justice or persistently fails to comply with summonses or when his identity cannot be established.\n#### C. Obligations of the accused\nAs worded at the relevant time, Article 75 of the CCP provided that an accused who was not deprived of his liberty was required to appear whenever he received a summons in the course of criminal proceedings. He was also required to inform the authority conducting the proceedings of any change of his abode or of any absence lasting longer t", "001-85489": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF P\u0130RO\u011eLU AND KARAKAYA v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n26. The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was in force at the time of the events read as follows:\nArticle 302\n\u201cUnless otherwise specifically provided by law, objection proceedings are conducted without a hearing. If necessary, the public prosecutor [may be] heard.\u201d\nArticle 386\n\u201cAs regards infringements falling within its jurisdiction, the ... magistrates' court makes its ruling, without holding a hearing, through a penal order. The order can only be given in cases of simple or aggravated fines or in relation to offences carrying a maximum prison sentence of three months ...\u201d\nArticle 387\n\u201cThe judge schedules a hearing if he sees an inconvenience in ruling in the absence of one.\u201d\nArticle 390\n\u201cA hearing shall be held if an objection is raised to a prison sentence imposed by a penal order. (...)\nThe suspect can be represented by defence counsel during the hearing. (...)\nObjections to penal orders (...) are examined by a judge at the criminal court of first instance, in line with the procedure described under Articles 301, 302 and 303. The objection would suspend the execution of the penal order.\u201d\n27. In a judgment given on 30 June 2004, the Constitutional Court declared Article 390 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure unconstitutional and a nullity. It held that the lack of a public hearing before the Criminal Court of First Instance which examines objections to penal orders would be a deprivation of the right guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention, as well as Article 36 of the Constitution.\n28. Article 343 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning references to the Court of Cassation by written order of the Minister of Justice (Yaz\u0131l\u0131 emir ile bozma \u2013 \u201c the reference by written order\u201d) provides:\n\u201cWhere the Minister of Justice has been ", "001-85559": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF HACI ZEK\u0130 UZUN v.

The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He further alleged under the same provision that he had not been afforded a public hearing and had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s written opinion, which had denied him the right to a fair hearing.\n22. The relevant part of Article 6 \u00a7 1 reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n23. The Government claimed that the application had been lodged by the applicant on 23 April 2004, six months and two days after the final decision of the Court of Cassation. The Government concluded that the application should be declared inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. However, the Court observes that the date mentioned by the Government is in fact the date of registration of the application by the Registry of the Court, whereas the date stamped on the envelope which contained the application forms indicates that it was mailed on 16 April 2004. Consequently, the Court finds that the applicant lodged his application within the six-month time-limit (see Y\u0131ld\u0131z and Ta\u015f v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance Tax Act 1984\n13. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person\u2019s property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 300,000 for transfers between 5 April 2007 and 5 April 2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n14. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the taxpayer\u2019s election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (section 227(1)-(4)).\n15. Section 18(1) of the Inheritance Tax Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005 this exemption was extended to a deceased\u2019s \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004\n16. The purpose of the Civil Partnership Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n17. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; and (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n18. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The Civil Partnership Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering, inter alia, pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration, intended to create parity between civil partnership and marriage for all purposes except in the very few cases where there was an objective justification for not doing so. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners\u2019 property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n19. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was adopted in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance-tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had cohabited for at least twelve years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n20. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O\u2019Caithlin [the Conservative peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times \u2013 at Second Reading and in Grand Committee \u2013and I have pushed the government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, a Liberal Democrat peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith, Member of Parliament, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill \u2013 granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law, with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings.\nWe heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that the Civil Partnership Bill is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives, not because those concerns are not important, but because the Bill is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them.\u201d\n#### C. The Human Rights Act 1998\n21. The Human Rights Act 1998 entered into force on 2 October 2000. Section 3(1) provides:\n\u201cSo far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\u201d\nSection 4 of the 1998 Act provides (so far as relevant):\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. ...\n(6) A declaration under this section ...\n(a) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given; and\n(b) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.\u201d\nSection 6 provides:\n\u201c(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\n(a) as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted any differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of ... primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions. ...\u201d\nSection 10 provides:\n\u201c(1) This section applies if\n(a) a provision of legislation has been declared under section 4 to be incompatible with a Convention right and, if an appeal lies \u2013\n(i) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so; or\n(ii) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time; or\n(iii) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned; or\n(b) it appears to a Minister of the Crown or Her Majesty in Council that, having regard to a finding of the European Court of Human Rights made after the coming into force of this section in pro", "001-86298": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF ORR v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. In so far as relevant, Article 192(1) and (2) of the Penal Code read:\n\u201cAny person who\na) engages in sexual activity by means of violence or threats, [...]\nshall be guilty of rape and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years. In deciding whether the offender made use of violence or threats or whether the aggrieved person was incapable of resisting the act, importance shall be attached to whether the aggrieved person was under 14 years of age.\nA penalty of imprisonment for not less than two years shall be imposed if\na) the said activity was sexual intercourse, or [...]\nA person who, due to gross negligence, is guilty of rape according to the first paragraph above shall be punished with minimum five years\u2019 imprisonment. ... \u201d\n16. Under Norwegian criminal law there are four basic conditions that must be met in order to establish criminal liability:\n(1) the accused has committed the proscribed act or omission (actus reus) which is contrary to a provision of the Penal Code or to a special statutory penal provision in force at the time when the act was committed;\n(2) there are no exonerating circumstances (e.g. self-defence);\n(3) the accused has acted with intent (mens rea), unless otherwise expressly stated in the relevant penal provision; and\n(4) the accused was of sound mind at the time of the commission of the offence.\nAs a general rule, the prosecution has to prove these four elements beyond reasonable doubt. Any reasonable doubt shall benefit the accused (in dubio pro reo).\n17. In so far as is relevant, Article 376A of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads:\n\u201cIf the jury\u2019s verdict is that the person is not guilty, but the court finds that he is undoubtedly guilty, the court may unanimously decide that the case shall be retried before other judges. At the new trial the High Court shall be constituted as a composite court (meddomsrett)...\u201d\n18. Article 376 of the same Code provides:\n\u201cIf the jury\u2019s verdict is that the accused is not guilty and if the court does not take a decision pursuant to Article 376A, it shall render a judgement of acquittal.\u201d\nNo reasons are given for an acquittal.\n19. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1981, a civil claim may be pursued in connection with a criminal trial, provided that the claim arises from the same set of facts. The claim is decided by the three professional judges who have taken part in the criminal case, without the participation of the jury.\nArticle 3 reads:\n\u201cAny legal claim that the aggrieved person or any other injured person has against the person charged may, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 29, be pursued in connection with such cases as are mentioned in Article 1 or Article 2, provided that the said claim arises from the same act that the case is concerned with...\nThe claims specified in the first and second paragraphs are deemed to be civil claims and shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 29...\u201d.\n20. The court will determine the claim on the basis of the evidence adduced during the trial. However, it may receive further evidence. Article 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, then in force, (tvistem\u00e5lsloven- Law of 13 August 1915 no. 6; replaced with effect from 1 January 2008 by a new Code) required that the professional judges, precisely and exhaustively, state the facts on which they base their decision on the alleged victim\u2019s civil claim.\n21. Other provisions concerning civil compensation claims may be found in Chapter 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, notably the following:\nArticle 427\n\u201cIn a public prosecution, the prosecuting authority may on application pursue such civil legal claims as are specified in Article 3. ...\nWhen civil claims are pursued against a person other than the person charged, the person concerned assumes the position of a party to the case in so far as this issue is concerned. ...\u201d\nArticle 428\n\u201cAny person who has any such civil claim as is specified in Article 3 may himself pursue it in connection with a public prosecution if a main hearing is held. ...\u201d\nArticle 435\n\u201cA separate appeal against a decision of civil claims shall be brought in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The same shall apply to a reopening of the case.\u201d\n22. Under the Damage Compensation Act ", "001-86341": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SMITH v.

Relying on Article 8 of the Convention, the applicant alleges, inter alia, that the Romanian authorities failed to take adequate steps in order to secure the enforcement of the judgment which gave him the right to have access to his son for a total of 82 days per year. The Romanian authorities were wrong to allow the mother to take the child out of the country, and they failed to assist him in the proceedings before the English courts.\nFurthermore, according to the applicant, the United Kingdom also failed to assist him adequately in retaining contact with the child or to ensure the child\u2019s return to Romania. They were wrong in the first place to have issued a visa to the child without his consent and later in not sending him back to Romania after the expiry of his visa. The authorities obstructed the applicant\u2019s access to the United Kingdom by lengthy questioning before his entry into British territory. They also obstructed his contacts with the child by only allowing him to have meetings lasting a maximum of two hours in \u201clocked rooms, under the supervision of one or two strangers\u201d. On several occasions he was not allowed to take pictures of his son and was forced to speak English with him. His Article 8 rights were also infringed by the excessively long proceedings before the English courts. Article 8 reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n61. He further complains, under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, of a breach of the principle of equality of arms by the United Kingdom courts because he was not allowed to have any information concerning his son, which put him in a position of procedural inequality vis-\u00e0-vis his former wife.

Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that paying the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family\u2019s standard of living.\n33. Under Article 117 of the Code, persons exempted from court fees may request that legal aid be granted to them. The court shall allow the request if it considers that a lawyer\u2019s participation in the case is required. The court will then request the relevant District Bar Association or the District Chamber of Legal Advisers to assign an advocate or a legal adviser to the claimant\u2019s case.\n34.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Aliens Act 1997\n30. At the material time the Aliens Act 1997 (Fremdengesetz) was in force. Sections 36 to 38, in so far as relevant, read as follows:\nSection 36\n\u201c(1) An exclusion order can be issued against an alien if it can justifiably be supposed, on the basis of specific facts, that his residence\n##### 1. endangers public peace, order and security; or\n2. runs counter to other public interests specified in Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n(2) The existence of specific facts within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be made out, in particular, if an alien\n1. has been sentenced by a domestic court to an unsuspended term of imprisonment of more than three months; to a term of imprisonment partly suspended on probation; or to a term of imprisonment of more than six months suspended on probation; or has been convicted by final judgment more than once for the same pernicious tendency to commit criminal acts.\u201d\nSection 37\n\u201c(1) Should there be an interference with the alien\u2019s private or family life on account of ... an exclusion order, such a deprivation of the right of residence shall be permissible only if necessary as a matter of urgency in furtherance of one of the aims set out in Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n(2) ... an exclusion order shall not in any case be issued if its effects on the alien and his family\u2019s situation outweigh the adverse consequences of not taking such a measure. In weighing the above factors, regard shall be had in particular to the following circumstances:\n1. the period of residence and the extent to which the alien or members of his family have integrated;\n2. the strength of family or other ties.\u201d\nSection 38\n\u201c(1) An exclusion order shall not be issued if\n...\n4. the alien has grown up in the host country from early childhood and has been lawfully settled there for many years.\u201d\n31. The Administrative Court held that only aliens who had grown up in Austria from the age of three or younger had grown up there \u201cfrom early childhood\u201d within the meaning of section 38(1)(4) of the Aliens Act (see, for instance, decision of 17 September 2001, no. 96/18/0150; judgment of 2 March 1999, no. 98/18/0244; and judgment of 21 September 2000, no. 2000/18/0135).\n#### B. Civil Code\n32. Article 21 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides:\n\u201cMinors are persons who have not yet reached the age of 18 years. ...\u201d\nThis version of Article 21 of the Civil Code entered into force on 1 July 2001. Before that date the age of majority was 19 years.\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. Instruments of the Council of Europe\n33. The following two Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe are of particular interest in the context of the present case.\n34. The first one is Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2000)15 concerning the security of residence of long-term migrants, adopted on 13 September 2000, which states, inter alia:\n\u201c4. As regards the protection against expulsion\n(a) Any decision on expulsion of a long-term immigrant should take account, having due regard to the principle of proportionality and in the light of the European Court of Human Rights\u2019 constant case-law, of the following criteria:\n\u2013 the personal behaviour of the immigrant;\n\u2013 the duration of residence;\n\u2013 the consequences for both the immigrant and his or her family;\n\u2013 existing links of the immigrant and his or her family to his or her country of origin.\n(b) In application of the principle of proportionality as stated in paragraph 4 (a), member States should duly take into consideration the length or type of residence in relation to the seriousness of the crime committed by the long-term immigrant. More particularly, member States may provide that a long-term immigrant should not be expelled\n\u2013 after five years of residence, except in the case of a conviction for a criminal offence where sentenced to in excess of two years\u2019 imprisonment without suspension; and\n\u2013 after ten years of residence, except in the case of a conviction for a criminal offence where sentenced to in excess of five years\u2019 imprisonment without suspension.\nAfter twenty years of residence, a long-term immigrant should no longer be expellable.\n(c) Long-term immigrants born on the territory of the member State or admitted to the member State before the age of ten, who have been lawfully and habitually resident, should not be expellable once they have reached the age of 18.\nLong-term immigrants who are minors may in principle not be expelled.\n(d) In any case, each member State should have the option to provide in its internal law that a long-term immigrant may be expelled if he or she constitutes a serious threat to national security or public safety.\u201d\n35. The second one is Committee of Ministers Recommendation Rec(2002)4 on the legal status of persons admitted for family reunification, adopted on 26 March 2002. It states that where the withdrawal of or the refusal to renew a residence permit, or the expulsion of a family member, is being considered:\n\u201c... member States should have proper regard to criteria such as the person\u2019s place of birth, his age of entry on the territory, the length of residence, his family relationships, the existence of family ties in the country of origin and the solidity of social and cultural ties with the country of origin. Special consideration should be paid to the best interest and well-being of children.\u201d\n#### B. Instruments of the United Nations\n36.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Relevant domestic law and practice\n##### 1. Provisions of domestic law\n28. Article 83 of the Turkish Constitution, on the subject of parliamentary immunity, reads as follows:\n\u201cMembers of the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not be liable for their votes and statements concerning parliamentary functions, for the views they express before the Assembly or, unless the Assembly decides otherwise on the proposal of the Bureau for that sitting, for repeating or revealing these outside the Assembly.\nA Member who is alleged to have committed an offence before or after election shall not be arrested, interrogated, detained or tried unless the Assembly decides otherwise. This provision shall not apply in cases where a member is caught in the act of committing a crime punishable by a heavy penalty and in cases subject to Article 14 of the Constitution if an investigation has been initiated before the election. However, in such situations the competent authority shall notify the Turkish Grand National Assembly immediately and directly.\nThe execution of a criminal sentence imposed on a member of the Turkish Grand National Assembly either before or after his election shall be suspended until he ceases to be a member; the statute of limitations does not apply during the term of membership.\nInvestigation and prosecution of a re-elected deputy shall be subject to whether or not the Assembly lifts immunity in the case of the individual involved.\nPolitical party groups in the Turkish Grand National Assembly shall not hold discussions or take decisions regarding parliamentary immunity.\u201d\n29. The Rules of Procedure of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey provide, inter alia:\n\u201cWork of the plenary Assembly\nAgenda\nRule 49: the agenda of the plenary Assembly of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey shall comprise:\n1.

General debates and prior discussions on parliamentary research to be done.\n7. Oral questions.\n8. Draft legislation and other work submitted by the committees.\nAt the proposal of the recommendation committee and with the agreement of the plenary Assembly, it is possible to set aside a day of the week and allocate a set time for items 6 and 7.\nIt is also possible to set aside a day of the week for the votes referred to in items 3 and 4.\nThe order in which items on the agenda are taken is determined according to the date on which they were received by the Speaker's Office.\nWhen the Speaker deems it necessary, the recommendation committee may propose to the plenary Assembly the order in which matters pertaining to item 8 should be examined. Requests concerning that order submitted by the Government, substantive committees and the authors of bills shall be examined by the recommendation committee.\nThe opinion of the recommendation committee shall be submitted for the approval of the plenary Assembly. (...)\nNo subject which has not been subjected to the opinion of the recommendation committee, confirmed by the plenary Assembly and announced in advance by the Speaker's Office may be debated in the plenary Assembly. (...)\nImmunity\nRequests to lift immunity and committee competent to examine them\nRule 131: requests for the lifting of a Member's parliamentary immunity shall be transmitted by the Speaker's Office to the joint committee, composed of members of the constitutional and judicial committees. (...)\nThe preparatory committee and its hearings\nRule 132: the Chair of the joint committee shall appoint a preparatory committee composed of five sworn members to examine files concerning immunity. (...)\nThis committee shall examine all the documents and, if necessary, hear the Member concerned; it shall not hear witnesses.\nThe preparatory committee shall submit its report within one month of being convened.\nThe joint committee shall finalise the report within one month.\nThe report of the joint committee\nRule 133: the joint committee shall examine the report and its appendices [submitted by] the preparatory committee.\nThe joint committee shall decide whether to lift the Member's immunity or to stay the proceedings until the end of the term of parliamentary or ministerial office.\nIf the joint committee's report recommends a stay of proceedings, it shall be read out to the plenary Assembly. If no objection to the report is received in writing within ten days, the report shall become final.\nIf the report recommends lifting immunity or if a written objection is received within ten days, the report shall be examined by the plenary Assembly.\nIf the proceedings have been stayed and that decision is overturned by the plenary Assembly, no action may be taken against the Member concerned until the end of his or her term of parliamentary office, even if the legislature has been renewed.\nThe rights of the defence\nRule 134: When a request to lift a Member's immunity has been received, the Member concerned may, if he wishes, defend himself or be defended by another Member before the preparatory committee, the joint committee and the plenary Assembly.\nThe matter shall be decided on the evidence if a Member who has asked to speak in his defence fails to answer the invitation to do so.\nIn any event, the defence shall have a say.\nThe mere fact that a Member requests permission to waive his or her immunity shall not suffice.\n30. Under Article 107 of the old Criminal Code enshrined in Law no. 765 of 1 March 1936:\n\u201cIf the opening of proceedings is subject to authorisation, adoption of a decision or the resolution of a problem pending before another body (...), the running of time for the purposes of limitation shall be suspended until such authorisation is obtained, such decision adopted or such problem resolved.\u201d\n31.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Drug Trafficking Act 1994\n20. The 1994 Act set out a scheme for the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking in respects of offences committed before 23 March 2003. Where all the offences charged or indicted in the proceedings were committed after that date, the 1994 Act no longer applies and instead the sentencing court will impose a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.\n21. Section 2 of the 1994 Act provided that a Crown Court should make a confiscation order in respect of a defendant appearing before it for sentencing in respect of one or more drug-trafficking offences, whom the court found to have received at any time any payment or other reward in connection with drug trafficking.\n22. Under section 5 of the 1994 Act, the confiscation order had to be set at a sum corresponding to the proceeds of drug trafficking assessed by the court to have been gained by the defendant, unless the court was satisfied that, at the time the confiscation order is made, only a lesser sum could be realised.\n23. At the first stage of this procedure, the onus was on the prosecution to establish that the defendant had benefited from drug trafficking. However, section 4(2) and (3) of the 1994 Act required the court to assume that any property appearing to have been held by him at any time since his conviction or during the period of six years before the date on which the criminal proceedings were commenced was received as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking, and that any expenditure incurred by him during the same period was paid for out of the proceeds of drug trafficking. This statutory assumption could be set aside by the defendant in relation to any particular property or expenditure if it was shown by him to be incorrect or if there would be a serious risk of injustice if it were applied (section 4(4)). At the second stage of the procedure, the burden shifts to the defendant to establish that the amount that might be realised is less than the amount of benefit (see R. v. Barwick, paragraphs 24-25 below). The required standard of proof applicable throughout proceedings under the 1994 Act was the balance of probabilities (section 2(8)).\n#### B. R. v. Barwick\n24.

Chapter 42, section 6, of the Code stipulates that a district court shall prepare cases with a view to their speedy adjudication. The Code does not, however, contain any provision stating that civil cases must be determined within certain time-limits.\n19. Moreover, a general principle underlying the Code is that the Court of Appeal is not to try claims, circumstances invoked as a basis for claims or evidence as a court of first instance. This means that, as a general rule, the Court of Appeal\u2019s examination of the case is limited to investigation of the matter presented to and examined by the District Court.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The concept of secularism in France\n17. In France, the exercise of religious freedom in public society, and more particularly the issue of wearing religious signs at school, is directly linked to the principle of secularism on which the French Republic was founded.\n18. Arising out of a long French tradition, the concept of secularism has its origins in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, Article 10 of which provides that \u201cNo one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.\u201d It also appears in the key Education Acts of 1882 and 1886, which introduced state primary education on a compulsory and secular basis. The real keystone of French secularism, however, is the Act of 9 December 1905, known as the Law on the Separation between Church and State, which marked the end of a long conflict between the republicans, born of the French Revolution, and the Catholic Church. Section 1 provides: \u201cThe Republic shall ensure the freedom of conscience. It shall guarantee free participation in religious worship, subject only to the restrictions laid down hereinafter in the interest of public order.\u201d The principle of separation is affirmed in section 2 of the Act: \u201cthe Republic may not recognise, pay stipends to or subsidise any religious denomination.\u201d A number of consequences flow from this \u201csecular pact\u201d both for public services and users. It implies an acknowledgement of religious pluralism and State neutrality towards religions. In return for protection of his or her freedom of religion, the citizen must respect the public arena that is shared by all. The principle was then enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution of 27 October 1946, which has had constitutional status since a decision of the Constitutional Council of 15 January 1975, which states: \u201cThe Nation guarantees equal access for children and adults to instruction, vocational training and culture. The provision of free, public and secular education at all levels is a duty of the State.\u201d Lastly, the principle acquired actual constitutional status in Article 1 of the Constitution of 4 October 1958, which provides: \u201cFrance shall be an indivisible, secular, democratic and social Republic. It shall ensure the equality of all citizens before the law, without distinction of origin, race or religion. It shall respect all beliefs.\u201d\n19. From the 1980s the French secular model was confronted with the integration of Muslims into society, particularly in schools.\n20. The year 1989 saw the first of the \u201cIslamic headscarf\u201d cases. At the beginning of the school year a number of incidents occurred in secondary schools and in particular in Creil Lower Secondary School, in the d\u00e9partement of the Oise, when three pupils were suspended for refusing to remove their headscarf despite being requested to do so by the teaching staff and the principal of the school. The case quickly became a highly topical issue. As there was no clear legal answer, and in accordance with a request from the Minister for Education, the Conseil d'Etat, in an advisory opinion of 27 November 1989 (see paragraph 26 below), stated the position that should be adopted when pupils manifested their religion.\n21. Some ten years later more and more issues relating to the headscarf had arisen and the advisory opinion does not appear to have provided a lasting solution to the difficulties. According to a report prepared for the Minister for Education in July 2005, \u201cthe matter appears to have taken on considerable proportions because having started with three headscarves in Creil in 1989, the Minister referred to 3,000 such cases when addressing the Senate in 19940.\u201d In France, the troubles have given rise to various forms of collective mobilisation regarding the question of the place of Islam in Republican society. It is in this context that, on 1 July 2003, the President of the Republic instructed a commission to study the application of the principle of secularism in the Republic. That commission, known as the \u201cStasi commission\u201d, after the name of its chairman, produced a report for the President of the Republic on 11 December 2003. The picture it presented of the threat to secularism bordered on the alarming. It said\n\u201cinstances of behaviour and conduct that run counter to the principle of secularism are on in the increase, particularly in public society. ... The reasons for the deterioration in the situation ... [are the] difficulties in integrating experienced by those who have arrived in France during the past decades, the living conditions in many suburbs of our towns, unemployment, the feeling experienced by many people living in France that they are the subject of discrimination, or are even being driven out o", "001-90127": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DEM\u0130REL AND ATE\u015e (NO. 3) v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION IN RESPECT OF HAYDAR CEYLAN\n45. The applicant in the second application, Haydar Ceylan, complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, that he had been subjected to ill\u2011treatment while in police custody and that the authorities had failed to punish those responsible for this.\nThe Court considers that these complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 3 alone, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n46. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that the applicant had failed to lodge an appeal against the judgment of the Istanbul Assize Court.\n47. The applicant contended in reply that under Article 102 \u00a7 4 of the former Criminal Code, taken together with Article 243 of the same Code, there was a five-year time-limit for prosecuting offences of ill-treatment and torture committed by civil servants. He submitted that, according to Article 104 \u00a7 2 of the former Criminal Code, the running of the statutory time-limits defined in Article 102 could be interrupted by a variety of events such as a conviction, an arrest, the detention and questioning of an accused and, in case of such an interruption, the time would start to run again from the date of the latest event. Yet the same paragraph stipulated that, anyway, the statutory time-limit could be extended for a maximum additional period of half the period prescribed in Article 102. Therefore, the statutory time-limit for the prosecution of offences of ill-treatment and torture had expired at the end of seven years and six months. The applicant contended that it was true that seven and a half years had elapsed since his ill-treatment in police custody and that, therefore, the assize court\u2019s judgment was in accordance with Articles 102 and 104 of the former Criminal Code. The applicant concluded that an appeal to the Court of Cassation would have been devoid of any chance of success in the circumstances of his case.\n48.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Land Code\n15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code.\n16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations.\n17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service.\n18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence.\n19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides:\n\u201cWhen using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...\u201d\nDisturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42.\nSpecial provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement.

Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n23. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, in 1974 the applicant had not been the owner of any property located in northern Cyprus. Nor was he, according to the same source, the owner of any property at the present time. Given that in 1974 the applicant had had no right or interest in relation to the properties at issue, no question of a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could arise. Even assuming that the applicant had acquired the properties in question in 1990, this would have happened sixteen years after the events of 1974 and three years after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. Therefore, he should have known that access to the properties was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it.\n13. In the light of the above, the Government argued that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n14. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points. Administrative and judicial remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were therefore accessible to them.\n15. Law no. 49/2003 provided for the establishment of an independent Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission with jurisdiction to award compensation for Greek-Cypriot immovable properties in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, on the basis of the market value on 20 July 1974, plus compensation for the loss of use, loss of income and increases in the value of property. The decisions of this Commission could be appealed to the High Administrative Court. Given the existence of this remedy, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### B. The applicant\u2019s arguments\n16. The applicant observed that his parents had been the lawful owners of the properties in question in 1974. The Government could have ascertained this by consulting the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d. There had been the expectation that the applicant and his sister would, in due course, become the registered owners. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive the applicant\u2019s parents of their title (see Loizidou v. Turkey, (merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The applicant had become the legal owner of the properties on 20 April 1990 and this fact had been recorded by the official authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The donation could not have been recorded by the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d because the authorities of the \u201cTRNC\u201d considered that the properties had already been expropriated. The Government could not rely on the records of the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d ", "001-90751": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF GAVRIEL v.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objections of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that the applicant had no title to the properties in question in view of the constitutional and legal provisions applying in the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d). As a result of the entry into force of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d Constitution, these properties were no longer registered in the name of the applicant. According to the information supplied by the \u201cTRNC\u201d Lands and Survey Department, the property described in paragraph 9 (a) above was registered in the name of the \u201cTRNC\u201d as being abandoned property. The property described in paragraph 8 above had been divided into two separate plots and joined with adjacent plots; new title deeds had been issued in the name of Turkish Cypriots whose properties had been expropriated by the Greek Cypriot authorities. As to the other properties allegedly owned by the applicant in Livera, the certificate issued by the Greek-Cypriot authorities (no 9-500409 of 26 February 1992) could not be considered reliable and had in all probability been based on the information supplied by the applicant himself. In particular, the field described in paragraph 9 (c) above was not owned by the applicant in 1974 and had been given to Turkish Cypriots whose property had been expropriated by the Greek-Cypriot authorities. The field described in paragraph 9 (b) above was State property and had been declared a \u201cforest area\u201d. The properties described in paragraph 9 (d) and (e) above were not owned by the applicant in 1974 and were \u201cTRNC\u201d property. In support of their statement that in 1974 the applicant was not the owner of the fields described in paragraph 9 (c), (d) and (e) above the Government produced copies of the relevant pages of the land records.\n13. The Government recalled that the occupation of northern Cyprus had taken place in 1974, and therefore before the recognition by Turkey of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (22 January 1990). They argued that the application should be rejected as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention. Furthermore, the situation complained of was not a continuing one and there was no causal link between the 1974 Turkish military intervention and the alleged violation of the applicant\u2019s rights after 22 January 1990.\n14. In the light of all the above, the Government submitted that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n15. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the Law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Primary legislation applicable to Al-Khawaja\n22. At the time of the trial judge's ruling and the trial in Mr Al-Khawaja's case, the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections 23 to 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Section 23 of the 1988 Act provides for the admission of first hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial:\n\u201c23.\u2014...a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if\u2014\n(2)(a) the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness...\n25.\u2014(1) If, having regard to all the circumstances\u2014\n(a) the Crown Court\u2014\n(i) on a trial on indictment;\n(ii) on an appeal from a magistrates' court; or\n(iii) on the hearing of an application under section 6 of the [1987 c. 38.] Criminal Justice Act 1987 (applications for dismissal of charges of fraud transferred from magistrates' court to Crown Court); or\n(b) the criminal division of the Court of Appeal; or\n(c) a magistrates' court on a trial of an information,\nis of the opinion that in the interests of justice a statement which is admissible by virtue of section 23 or 24 above nevertheless ought not to be admitted, it may direct that the statement shall not be admitted.\n(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) above, it shall be the duty of the court to have regard\u2014\n(a) to the nature and source of the document containing the statement and to whether or not, having regard to its nature and source and to any other circumstances that appear to the court to be relevant, it is likely that the document is authentic;\n(b) to the extent to which the statement appears to supply evidence which would otherwise not be readily available;\n(c) to the relevance of the evidence that it appears to supply to any issue which is likely to have to be determined in the proceedings; and\n(d) to any risk, having regard in particular to whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the statement if the person making it does not attend to give oral evidence in the proceedings, that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to the accused or, if there is more than one, to any of them.\u201d\n#### B. Primary legislation applicable to Tahery\n23. The following legislative provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 were drafted as a means to tackle crime by providing special measures to protect witnesses who have a genuine fear of intimidation and repercussions. The Act entered into force in April 2005.\n24. Section 116 (2)(e) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (cases where a witness is unavailable) states that:\n\u201cIn criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if...through fear the relevant person does not give (or does not continue to give) oral evidence in the proceedings, either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement, and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence.\u201d\nSection 116 (4) state", "001-90786": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u015eER\u0130FE Y\u0130\u011e\u0130T v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n57. With regard to civil proceedings the Administration of Justice Act reads in as far as relevant:\nSection 312\n(1) The losing party shall compensate the opponent for the expenses inflicted on the opponent by the proceedings, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n(2) The court may decide that the losing party shall not or shall only partially compensate the opponent for the expenses inflicted if particular reasons make it appropriate.\n(3)...\n58. Thus, although Danish law does not refer to a remedy specifically designed or developed to provide redress in respect of complaints about excessive length of civil proceedings, according to domestic case-law in civil proceedings initiated by an individual against or involving Government Institutions, if the courts, having examined a length-of-proceedings complaint, find a violation, they may grant redress therefor by, for example, exempting the individual from paying legal costs or by deciding that expenses and fees shall be covered by the Treasury (see, inter alia, Kirsten Norman v. Denmark (dec.), no. 44704/98, 14 June 2001).\n59. To illustrate that section 312, subsection 2, of the Administration of Justice Act is an effective remedy for providing adequate redress for a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in civil lawsuits of this nature, the Government referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 24 April 2003 published in the Weekly Law Review (Ugeskrift for Retsv\u00e6sen) 2003, page 1550 (U 2003.1550 H). In that case the Supreme Court upheld a High Court judgment in a case filed by a child and its parents against a County Council. Even though the plaintiffs lost the case, the Supreme Court, in consideration of the extraordinary length of the legal proceedings, invoked section 312, subsection 2, and exempted the plaintiffs from compensating the County Council for its legal costs. When doing so the Supreme Court explicitly referred to Article 6 of the Convention.\n60. At the relevant time, pursuant to section 224 of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven), as the main rule, civil proceedings are instituted before the City Court being the first judicial instance. Certain lawsuits, however, are brought before the High Court (sections 225 and 226 of the said Act) as the court of first instance, for example if a dispute between an i", "001-90931": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF MEHMET AL\u0130 \u00c7EL\u0130K v.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 25 May 1992, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His son, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s son can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Loukas Nicola (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n16. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that since July 1974 Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n13. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 3 November 1994, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His heirs (his wife and his two sons) informed the Court that they wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v.

The applicant complained of a violation of her right to peaceful enjoyment of her possessions, since she was prevented from returning to and making use of his property in northern Cyprus.\nShe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n16. The Government disputed this claim.\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n17. The Government submitted that the applicant had produced no evidence that at the time of the 1974 Turkish intervention she had been the owner of plots of lands in the Kalogrea village. It followed that her claims under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were unsubstantiated. Moreover, the applicant had not applied through the proper channels to visit her alleged properties. She had not attempted to enter the northern part of Cyprus at an approved crossing point; the so-called attempt on 9 December 1990 had been a publicity ploy, instigated by the Greek-Cypriot administration.\n18. Finally, the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights could not be seen in isolation from the general political situation on the island of Cyprus and had been in any event justified in the general interest.\n##### 2. The applicant\n19. The applicant complained that since the Turkish invasion of the northern part of Cyprus in July 1974, Turkey had prevented her from exercising her right to the peaceful enjoyment of her home and possessions. She submitted, in particular, that on 9 December 1990 she had been prevented from returning to her home and property. The applicant observed that she had produced documentary evidence that she was the owner of the properties at issue. Relying on the principles laid down by the Court in the case of Loizidou v.

The Government disputed this claim.\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n15. The Government submitted that the applicant had produced no evidence to show that at the time of the 1974 Turkish intervention he had been the owner of immovable property either in Kyrenia or in Ayios Epiktitos. The applicant had confined himself in producing a certificate obtained from the Greek Cypriot Department of Lands and Surveys on 21 October 1992, at the applicant\u2019s request and on the basis of information supplied by him. According to this document, a certain \u201cMichail Michail\u201d was the owner of a \u201cfield with trees\u201d (plot no. 120) in Ayios Epiktitos, which he had acquired only on 27 June 1990. In the Government\u2019s opinion, this did not prove that the applicant had title to the land at issue at the material time.\n16. Moreover, the applicant had not applied through the proper channels to visit his alleged properties. He had not attempted to enter the northern part of Cyprus at an approved crossing point, and had not been prevented from doing so by Turkish or Turkish-Cypriot forces. He had been stopped on the southern side of the buffer zone by UNFICYP, in the vicinity of the Greek-Cypriot cease-fire line. The Turkish forces had not been in any way involved in the incident.\n17.

In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised preliminary objections concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status in the light of the Law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d).

The Government submitted that the applicant had produced no evidence that at the time of the 1974 Turkish intervention he had been the owner of immovable property either in Kyrenia or in Ayios Amvrosios. The documents produced in support of his application had been obtained from the Greek Cypriot Land Authority on 7 November 1992, at the applicant\u2019s request and on the basis of information supplied by him.\n18.

He had been stopped on the southern side of the buffer zone by UNFICYP, in the vicinity of the Greek Cypriot cease-fire line. The Turkish forces had not been in any way involved in the incident. It was clear that the scenario staged by the applicant and others on 9 December 1990 had been contrary to the undertakings of the two sides relating to the status of the UN buffer zone, and had been constituted a violation of that status, so closely maintained by UNFICYP in order to keep the peace on the island.\n19.

Where juveniles are detained in police custody, account should be taken of their status as a minor, their age and their vulnerability and level of maturity. They should be promptly informed of their rights and safeguards in a manner that ensures their full understanding.

They should also have the right of access to a lawyer and a doctor. They should not be detained in police custody for longer than forty-eight hours in total and for younger offenders every effort should be made to reduce this time further.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n25. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe) one of the so-called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze). The other measures are bail (por\u0119czenie maj\u0105tkowe), police supervision (doz\u00f3r policji), guarantee by a responsible person (por\u0119czenie osoby godnej zaufania), guarantee by a social entity (por\u0119czenie spo\u0142eczne), temporary ban on engaging in a given activity (zawieszenie oskar\u017conego w okre\u015blonej dzia\u0142alno\u015bci) and prohibition on leaving the country (zakaz opuszczania kraju).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 1 sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures. That provision reads:\n\u201cPreventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and, exceptionally, also in order to prevent an accused\u2019s committing another, serious offence; they may be imposed only if evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence.\u201d\nArticle 258 lists grounds for pre-trial detention. It provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Pre-trial detention may be imposed if:\n(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or when he has no permanent abode [in Poland];\n(2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [witnesses or co\u2011defendants] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means;\n2. If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of at least 8 years\u2019 imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least 3 years\u2019 imprisonment, the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed.\u201d\nThe provisions on pre-trial detention are based on the precept that pre\u2011trial detention, the most extreme among the preventive measures, should not be imposed if more lenient measures are adequate.\nArticle 257 reads, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. Pre-trial detention shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient.\u201d\nArticle 259 \u00a7 1 reads:\n\u201c1. If there are no special reasons to the contrary, pre-trial detention shall be lifted, in particular if depriving an accused of his liberty would:\n(1) seriously jeopardise his life or health; or\n(2) entail excessively harsh consequences for the accused or his family.\u201d\nArticle 259 \u00a7 3 provides:\n\u201cPre-trial detention shall not be imposed if an offence attracts a penalty of imprisonment not exceeding one ye", "001-91286": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ONUR v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. Primary legislation\n23. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Section 3(5)(b) of the same Act (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n24. Sections 82(1) and 84(1)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against a decision to deport, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention and that it was not in accordance with the Immigration Rules.\n25. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n##### 2. The Immigration Rules\n26. The version of paragraph 364 of the Immigration Rules, which was in force prior to 20 July 2006, provided as follows:\n\u201cSubject to paragraph 380, in considering whether deportation is the right course on the merits, the public interest will be balanced against any compassionate circumstances of the case. While each case will be considered in the light of the particular circumstances, the aim is an exercise of the power of deportation which is consistent and fair as between one person and another, although one case will rarely be identical with another in all material respects. [In the cases detailed in paragraph 363A, deportation will normally be the proper course where a person has failed to comply with or has contravened a condition or has remained without authority]. Before a decision to deport is reached the Secretary of State will take into account all relevant factors known to him including:\n(i) age;\n(ii) length of residence in the United Kingdom;\n(iii) strength of connections with the United Kingdom;\n(iv) personal history, including character, conduct and employment record;\n(v) domestic circumstances;\n(vi) previous criminal record and the nature of any offence of which the person has been convicted;\n(vii) compassionate circumstances;\n(viii) any representations received on the person\u2019s behalf.\u201d\n27.

The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all relevant domestic remedies as required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that neither at the appellate nor at the cassation stage had the applicant alleged, even in substance, any infringement of his right to a fair hearing as presented in his subsequent complaint to the Court. In particular, the applicant had not questioned the alleged restrictions on his access to the case file and on taking notes from it. Nor had he complained that he could not present his arguments in accordance with the principles of an adversarial hearing and equality of arms.\n15. The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. Had the applicant been of the opinion that the legal provisions on which the courts had based their decisions or their interpretation \u2013 namely Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in conjunction with section 52 \u00a7 2 of the Lustration Act \u2013 had breached his rights, in particular his right to a fair hearing enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution, he should have lodged a constitutional complaint. In particular, the applicant should have requested the Constitutional Court to examine whether the rules imposed by those provisions had violated his right to a fair trial.\n16. The Government further submitted that the application had been lodged outside the time-limit of six months as the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case had been given on 1 February 2007 while he had lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007.\n17. The applicant disagreed. He submitted that the rules governing access to the case file and the manner in which the lustration proceedings had been conducted could not have been effectively challenged in an appeal or cassation appeal as they were provided for by the domestic law.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained that their conviction and sentence under section 6 of Law no. 3713 and the temporary closure of the newspaper had infringed their right to freedom of expression. They relied in that connection on Article 10 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, ... for the prevention of disorder or crime, [or] for the protection of the reputation or rights of others...\u201d\n#### A.

JOINDER\n41. In view of the similarity of the applications, the Court deems it appropriate to join them.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION IN RESPECT OF RIFAT B\u00d6KE\n42. In application no. 26968/02, the first applicant, Rifat B\u00f6ke, complained that he had been subjected to torture during his detention in police custody in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. He further complained under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention that the domestic authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into his allegations.\nThe Court finds it appropriate to examine these complaints under Article 3 of the Convention alone. Article 3 reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n43. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n1. The responsibility of the respondent State in the light of the substantive aspect of Article 3 of the Convention\n44.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The obligation to perform military or alternative service\n23. Article 9a \u00a7 3 of the Federal Constitution reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery male Austrian citizen is liable for military service. Conscientious objectors who refuse to perform compulsory military service and who are dispensed from this requirement must perform alternative service. The details shall be regulated by ordinary law.\u201d\n24. Section 24(3) of the Military Service Act, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:\n\u201cAn exemption from the obligation to perform military service shall apply to the following members of recognised religious societies:\n##### 1. ordained priests,\n2. persons involved in spiritual welfare or in clerical teaching after graduating in theological studies,\n##### 3. members of a religious order who have made a solemn vow, and\n4. students of theology who are preparing to assume a clerical function.\u201d\n25. Section 24(8) of the Military Service Act provided, inter alia, that persons whose fitness for military service, having initially been established, became questionable had to undergo another examination. However, the latest decision on fitness for performance of military service remained valid until the final conclusion of the fresh examination.\n#### B. Religious societies and religious communities\n##### 1.

Section 1 of the Act provides that all religious faiths which have not yet been recognised in the legal order may be recognised as a religious society if they fulfil the conditions set out in the Act, namely that their teaching, services and internal organisation, as well as the name they choose, do not contain anything unlawful or morally offensive and that the setting up and existence of at least one community of worship (Cultusgemeinde) satisfying the statutory criteria is ensured.\n27. Section 2 provides that if the above conditions are met, recognition is granted by the Minister for Religious Affairs (Cultusminister). Recognition has the effect that a religious society obtains legal personality under public law (juristische Person \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts) and enjoys all rights which are granted under the legal order to such societies.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Unemployment benefits\n14. A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance. The main regulations in this area are given in the Unemployment Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets-f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, SFS 1997:238; hereafter \u201cthe 1997 Act\u201c) and the Unemployment Funds Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor, SFS 1997:239). Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and State funding. A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit, a so-called basic insurance. Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment, that is he or she has worked a certain number of months before becoming unemployed, and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions, for example, he or she must actively be looking for work. At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of days. After that, a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits.\n15. According to Section 45(a) of the 1997 Act, the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary, without acceptable reasons, rejects suitable work or if he or she, without having expressly rejected the work, by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised. The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits. According to Section 46, the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme (arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program). Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in the 1997 Act can be appealed against to the administrative courts.\n#### B. The activity guarantee scheme and activity support\n16. The activity guarantee scheme was one of several different labour market policy programmes. The scheme ceased to be in force on 2 July 2007. According to Sections 8 and 21 of the 2000 Ordinance, a person could (the word \u201cmay\u201d (f\u00e5r) was used in the Ordinance) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was at least 20 years old, was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service. Section 6 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and, thus, an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective. Moreover, Section 7 stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy.\n17. A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits. His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support (f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d, SFS 1996:100). Section 23 of the 1997 Act stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining days of unemployment benefits. In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining days of unemployment benefits, \u201csince the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 54).\n18.

The relevant part of Article 523 \u00a7 1 of the Code provides:\n\u201cA cassation appeal may be lodged only on the grounds referred to in Article 439 [these include a number of procedural irregularities, such as, for instance, incorrect composition of the trial court; lack of legal assistance in cases where such assistance was compulsory; breach of the rules governing jurisdiction in criminal matters; trying a person in absentia in cases where his presence was obligatory and thus depriving him of an opportunity to defend himself, etc.] or on the ground of another flagrant breach of law provided that the judicial decision in question was affected as a result of that breach. A cassation appeal shall not lie against the severity of the penalty imposed (niewsp\u00f3\u0142mierno\u015bci kary).\u201d\n15. Pursuant to Article 524 \u00a7 1 of the Code, a cassation appeal has to be lodged with the appellate court competent to carry out an initial examination of its admissibility within thirty days from the date of service of the judgment of the appellate court with its written grounds on the party or, if the party has been represented, on his or her lawyer.\n##### 3. Legal assistance for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal\n16. Under Article 83 of the Code, an accused may appoint a lawyer to represent him or her in criminal proceedings. If he or she cannot afford lawyers\u2019 fees, a request for legal aid may be made under Article 78 of the Code.\n17. A grant of legal aid expires upon a judgment of an appellate court. A new decision on legal aid has to be made if the convicted person wishes to institute further proceedings in order to lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. The relevant part of Article 84 \u00a7 3 of the Code provides:\n\u201cA defence counsel appointed under the legal\u2011aid scheme in the cassation proceedings ... shall prepare and sign a cassation appeal ... or shall inform the court, in writing, that he or she has not found any grounds for lodging a cassation appeal ... If a cassation appeal ... is lodged, the defence counsel is entitled to represent the defendant in the subsequent proceedings.\u201d\n18. In its decision of 17 June 1997 (V KX 57/97, OSNKW 1997/9\u2011010/82) the Supreme Court stated that cassation proceedings had a special character in that the judgment essentially became final after it had been upheld by the appellate court. Bearing in mind the special character of these proceedings, the court was of the view that at this stage the mere fact that the convicted person was granted legal aid was sufficient to ensure an effective exercise of his or her defence rights. It was the lawyer\u2019s task to analyse the case and establish whether there were grounds on which to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the appellate court. If the lawyer was of the opinion that there were no grounds on which to do so, there was no legal basis in the Code of Criminal Procedure that would either oblige the lawyer to prepare such an appeal against his or her better judgment, or oblige the court to assign another lawyer to prepare such an appeal in the case.\n19. In its decision of 25 March 1998 the Supreme Court stated that the refusal of a legal\u2011aid lawyer to lodge a cassation appeal did not constitute a valid ground for granting retrospective leave to lodge such an appeal by another lawyer out of time (V KZ 12/98). It confirmed this ruling in a further decision of 1 December 1999. The Supreme Court observed that the court could ", "001-92693": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ESAT BAYRAM v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. Relying on Articles 2, 6 and 13 of the Convention, the applicant complained about the flaws in the domestic investigation which was initiated following the death of his brother during his military service. He believed that his brother had been deliberately shot and killed by his superior; however it had not been possible to prove his allegations because of the ineffectiveness of the domestic proceedings. The applicant further alleged that his brother had not received adequate medical care in the \u00c7anakkale Military Hospital.\n37. The Court considers that these complaints should be examined from the standpoint of Article 2 alone, which reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone\u2019s right to life shall be protected by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law.\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The Secretary of State is responsible for the management of the prison system in England and Wales (Prison Act 1952, sections 1 and 4).\n23. Until November 2007 each prison was required to appoint a medical officer (Prison Act 1952, section 7(1)). The medical officer was a prison officer who had to be a registered medical practitioner (Prison Act 1952, section 4). This requirement was removed by section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007 which came into force on 1 November 2007. Prison health care is now generally integrated with, and commissioned by, the National Health Service (NHS).\n24. Section 47(1) of the Prison Act 1952 authorises the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of prisons and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein. Such rules are made by statutory instrument, laid before Parliament, and are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (Prison Act 1952, section 52(1) and the Criminal Justice Act 1967, section 66(4)).\n25. Prisoners are classified in accordance with directions of the Secretary of State (Prison Rules SI 1999/728 rule 7(1)). Prisoners are classified in accordance with PSO 0900. Paragraph 1.1.1 of PSO 0900 contains the definitions of the four categories of prisoner (A, B, C and D). Category A is applied to prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or the security of the State, no matter how unlikely that escape might be, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible. Category B is applied to prisoners for whom the very highest conditions of security are not necessary, but for whom escape must be made very difficult.\n26. Rule 34 of the Prison Rules is headed \u201cCommunications Generally\u201d It provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) Without prejudice to sections 6 and 19 of the Prison Act 1952 and except as provided by these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any person outside the prison, or such person with him, except", "001-92855": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF STROBEL v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Hessen Disciplinary Code\n28. Article 22 of the Code, as in force at the material time, provides that the civil servant's supervisor institutes preliminary disciplinary investigations if there is a suspicion that the civil servant has committed a disciplinary offence. The results of the preliminary investigations must be communicated to the civil servant. Formal disciplinary proceedings are instituted if the supervisor considers that there is some likelihood that a disciplinary measure may be imposed (Article 24 of the Code). The formal disciplinary proceedings are composed of disciplinary investigations and proceedings before the Administrative Court (Article 29 of the Code). If the investigating authority decides not to discontinue the proceedings, its representative compiles the charges and transfers them to the disciplinary chamber of the Administrative Court (Article 58 of the Code), which orders either a disciplinary measure, the civil servant's acquittal or the discontinuation of the proceedings (Article 68 of the Code).\n29. Article 72 \u00a7 1 of the Code provides that judgments of the Administrative Court may be appealed within one month of their service on the civil servant. If the Administrative Court of Appeal considers the appeal, on points of fact and law, to be admissible and well-founded it quashes the judgment of the Administrative Court and rules on the matter itself (Article 79 of the Code) or, under certain circumstances, remits the case to the Administrative Court for fresh consideration (Article 78 \u00a7 1 No. 3 of the Code).\n30.

In the framework of the procedure before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below) the Polish Government supplied statistical data concerning the number and the length of pre-trial detentions ordered in the years 2005-2006 by the domestic courts. A more detailed rendition of the relevant statistical data can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n32. The Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provisions on the search of premises by the police:\nArticle 221\n\u00a7 1 Searches of inhabited premises can be made during the night only in cases when it is indispensable to carry out such searches without delay. Night-time lasts from 10 p.m. until 6 a.m.\n\u00a7 2 A search which has commenced during the day can be continued during the night.\n\u00a7 3 Only premises which are accessible at this time to a particular person or persons, or premises designed for storage, can be searched at night.\n33. The police\u2019s powers regarding the use of coercive measures is regulated by the Police Act of 6 April 1990 and by the Ordinance of the Council of Ministers of 17 September 1990 setting out the conditions and method of application of coercive measures.\n34. Pursuant to section 14 of the Police Corps Act, within the limits of their competence, the police are required \u2013 in order to examine, prevent and detect offences and petty offences \u2013 to carry out operational and reconnaissance activity, take part in an investigation or inquiry, or carry out administrative activity and safeguard public order. In the exercise of their powers the police must respect human dignity and human rights (section 3).\n35. Section 16 of the Police Corps Act provides that if a person does not comply with the lawful request of police officers they may apply such coercive measures as, for instance, using truncheons.\n36. The police are bound by the principle of minimal use of coercive measures. In accordance with this principle the police must only use such measures when they are absolutely necessary in the given circumstances in order to enforce execution of orders issued by the police (section 16 \u00a7 2).\n37.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the procedure for lodging cassation appeals with the Supreme Court against judgments of the appellate courts are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Kulikowski v. Poland and Antonicelli v. Poland.\n17. In particular, on 26 February 2002 the Supreme Court examined a particular situation where a legal-aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings, finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success. It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time-limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer\u2019s refusal and not on the earlier date when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself. It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal-aid lawyer\u2019s refusal had the right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for effective lodging of a cassation appeal (III KZ 87/01). The Supreme Court reiterated its position in a decision of 6 May 2008 and in a number of similar decisions given in 2008. It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time-limit in such situations was calculated, but the strand of the case-law launched by the decision given in February 2002 was both dominant and correct, and also accepted by doctrine as providing to the defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to the Supreme Court within a reasonable time frame (II KZ 16/08).\nTHE LAW\n### I.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Cypriot Criminal Code\n22. Section 70 of the Cypriot Criminal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cWhere five or more persons assemble with intent to commit an offence, or, being assembled with intent to carry out some common purpose, conduct themselves in such a manner as to cause persons in the neighbourhood to fear that the persons so assembled will commit a breach of the peace, or will by such assembly needlessly and without any reasonable occasion provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace they are an unlawful assembly.\nIt is immaterial that the original assembly was lawful if, being assembled, they conduct themselves with a common purpose in such a manner as aforesaid.\nWhen an unlawful assembly has begun to execute the purpose, whether of a public or of a private nature, for which it assembled by a breach of the peace and to the terror of the public, the assembly is called a riot, and the persons assembled are said to be riotously assembled.\u201d\n23. According to section 71 of the Criminal Code, any person who takes part in an unlawful assembly is guilty of a misdemeanour and liable to imprisonment for one year.\n24. Section 80 of the Criminal Code provides:\n\u201cAny person who carries in public without lawful occasion any offensive arm or weapon in such a manner as to cause terror to any person is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment for two years, and his arms or weapons shall be forfeited.\u201d\n25. According to section 82 of the Criminal Code, it is an offence to carry a knife outside the home.\n#### B. Police officers' powers of arrest\n26. The relevant part of Chapter 155, section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Law states:\n\u201c(1) Any officer may, without warrant, arrest any person -\n...\n(b) who commits in his presence any offence punishable with imprisonment;\n(c) who obstructs a police officer, while in the execution of his duty...\u201d\n#### C. Offence of illegal entry into \u201cTRNC\u201d territory\n27. Section 9 of Law No. 5/72 states:\n\u201c... Any person who enters a prohibited military area without authorization, or by stealth, or fraudulently, shall be tried by a military court in accordance with the Military Offences Act; those found guilty shall be punished.\u201d\n28. Subsections 12 (1) and (5) of the Aliens and Immigration Law read as follows:\n\u201c1. No person shall enter or leave the Colony except through an approved port.\n...\n5. Any person who contravenes or fails to observe any of the provisions of subsections (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to both such imprisonment and fine.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n29. In its decision on the admissibility of the application, the Court stated that in the light of its findings in the case of Loizidou v. Turkey ((merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI), the alleged violations of Articles 3, 11 and 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 were imputable to Turkey. As a result, the application could not be rejected as incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention or of its Protocols.\n30. The Court sees no reasons to depart from this finding. It will therefore proceed on the assumption that Turkey is responsible for the acts complained of, even if performed by the authorities of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d).\n### II.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the first applicant died on an unspecified date after his application was lodged while the case was still pending before the Court. His heirs (the other applicants) informed the Court that they wished to pursue the application in his name also (see paragraph 7 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right to the continued examination of the deceased's application (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the remaining applicants (the first applicant's wife, children, daughter-in-law and grandchildren) can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Thomas George Hadjithomas (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione temporis or ratione materiae\n(a) The Government's objection\n16. The Government submitted that the first applicant had lost his title to the properties in question after 1974 under Article 159 of the Constitution of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d). The remaining applicants did not claim to own any property in the northern part of Cyprus in 1974. The properties in question had purportedly been transferred to or inherited by them long after 1974. At no time after 1974 had the applicants been prevented by the Turkish authorities from returning to or using their properties. As a result, the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n(b) The applicants' arguments\n17. The applicants observed that the Government did not deny that the first applicant had been the lawful owner of the properties in question in 1974. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive him of his title, as held by the Court in the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment ((merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). As she was the first applicant's wife, the second applicant had a proprietary interest in the properties. The remaining applicants had lawfully acquired their title directly or indirectly from the first applicant.\n(c) The third par", "001-94216": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HADJIPROCOPIOU AND OTHERS v.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n11. The Court notes at the outset that the second applicant died on 19 October 2000, after the lodging of her application, while the case was pending before the Court. The two other applicants inherited her part of the properties referred to in the present application (see paragraph 10 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n12. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the first and third applicants can pursue the application initially brought by Mrs Elli Hadjiprocopiou (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n13. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicants complained that since August 1974, Turkey had prevented them from exercising their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions.\nThey invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government's objections\n##### 1. Objection of incompatibility ratione temporis or ratione materiae\n(a) The Government's objection\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, the applicants were not the owners of any property in the northern part of Cyprus in 1974. Nor were the applicants, according to the same source, the owners of any property at the date of introduction of the application. The property referred to in the application was originally registered in the name of the Government of Cyprus as a forest, then in the name of the applicants' father and, finally, in the name of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d). Given that in 1974 the applicants had no right or interest in relation to the property at issue, there was no question of a continuing violation that could have subsisted until 28 January 1987 when Turkey recognised the right of individual petition. Assuming that the applicants had acquired the property in 1995, there was no question of Turkish involvement in their inability to have access to the house in Ayios Amvrosios. Moreover, as they had acquired the property twenty-one years after the events of 1974 and eight years after Turkey's declaration concerning the right of individual petition, the applicants should have known that access to this property was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it. As a result, they cannot invoke Turkish responsibility. In the light of the above, the application should be considered incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n(b) The applicants' arguments\n13. Relying on the case-law developed by the Court in the case of Loizidou v. Turkey ((merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, 18 December 1996), the applicants alleged that the facts complained of were imputable to Turkey for the purposes of the Convention.\n14.

The applicant complained that since July 1974, Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n15. The Government disputed this claim.\n16. The applicant relied, essentially, on the principles laid down by the Court in the cases of Loizidou v. Turkey ((merits), Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, 18 December 1996) and Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV).\n17. The Government of Cyprus observed that the respondent Government did not contest the applicant's claims to ownership. It further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou v. Turkey ((merits), cited above), where the Court found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a cont", "001-94238": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SAVERIADES v.

The Government submitted that the applicant had not produced any evidence supporting his claims to ownership. The plot of land within the campus of the \u201cEastern Mediterranean University\u201d, which the applicant alleged belonged to him in 1974, was in fact registered in the name of the Government of Cyprus. It subsequently devolved to the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, and then to the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d) by virtue of the mandatory provisions of Article 159 of the Constitution of the \u201cTRNC\u201d.

The applicant alleged that when detained in the gendarmerie station she had been blindfolded, stripped naked and threatened with rape. She maintained that she had been examined by a doctor before making her statement to the gendarmerie.

In the Government's opinion the medical report of 9 March 2000 (see paragraph 8 above) proved that the applicant had not been subjected to ill-treatment.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n26. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court's judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no.31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 4 August 2006.\n#### B. Procedure for disqualification of a judge\n27. At the relevant time the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego) did not provide for any specific legal rules concerning disqualification of a judge deciding on the extension of a detainee's pre-trial detention.\n28. Article 40 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\u201cA judge is ex lege disqualified from his participation in a case, if: ...\n6) he has participated, in a lower court, in the delivery of a decision subject to an appeal, or has himself delivered a ruling subject to an appeal ...\u201d\n29. Article 42 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the procedure for disqualification of a judge:\n\u201c\u00a7 1. A disqualification shall be effected by the judge ex officio, by the court of its own motion, or upon a challenge made by a party to the proceedings.\n\u00a7 2. Upon discovery by a judge of grounds for his disqualification pursuant to Article 40, he shall disqualify himself by a written statement to be filed in the record of the case; another judge shall be substituted in his place.\n\u00a7 3. A judge against whom an application to challenge has been lodged pursuant to the provisions of Article 41 may file an appropriate written statement in the record of the case, and shall cease to participate in the case. He must, however, take measures which are not amenable to delay.\n\u00a7 4. Except in the event referred to in paragraph 2 above, the decision on a disqualification shall be made by the court before which the proceedings are pending; the judge concerned shall not participate in the panel which is to adopt the decision on that disqualification. If no such panel can be formed, the decision on the disqualification shall be made by a court of higher instance\u201d.\n30. As can be seen from a decision of the Katowice Court of Appeal, delivered on 19 October 2005 (no. II AKz 644/05), the wording \u201c[a judge] shall be disqualified\u201d (\u201cwy\u0142\u0105czony od udzia\u0142u w sprawie\u201d), which is used in Article 40 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, does not mean that such a judge should be excluded from delivery of a judgment only. In the opinion of the court the provision in question should also apply to all procedural decisions during the criminal proceedings, such as, for example, the imposition of pre-trial detention.

Members of the armed forces are appointed by the Crown under the Royal prerogative and hold their appointments \u201cat the Queen's pleasure\u201d.\n30. The TA, although essentially part-time, has a small number of attached regular army officers and non-commissioned officers responsible for organising and supervising the management and training of the unit. At the relevant time, the routine administration of the TA tended to be vested in a special category of uniformed reservists known as Non-Regular Permanent Staff (\u201cNRPS\u201d). NRPS were recruited into the TA to perform a specific job within a TA unit.\n31. Under section 205(1)(h) of the Army Act 1955, NRPS soldiers were subject at all times to military law.\n#### B.

Section 3(5)(a)0 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n17. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n18.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. Legal aid\n18. At the material time Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provided that parties to proceedings could ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant them an exemption from court fees provided that they submitted a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in their standard of living and that of their family.\n19. Parties to proceedings concerning social insurance allowances and pensions were exempted, under Article 463 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, from the obligation to pay court fees.\n20. Under Article 117 of the Code, persons exempted from court fees could request that legal aid be granted to them. This provision, in so far as relevant, provided:\n\u201c1. A party [to the proceedings] exempted partly or entirely from court fees may request that an advocate or a legal adviser be appointed for him or her. ... The court shall grant that request if it considers that the participation of an advocate or a legal adviser in the case is necessary. ...\n2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph are also applicable to parties who benefit from a statutory exemption from court fees, provided that they demonstrate, by way of the declaration referred to in Article 113 \u00a7 1, that the fees of the advocate or legal adviser would entail a reduction in their standard of living and that of their family. The court shall refuse to assign a lawyer to the case if it considers that the party's action or appeal is manifestly ill-founded.\u201d\n##### 2. Cassation appeals\n21. At the material time a party to civil proceedings could lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a final judicial decision of a second\u2011instance court terminating the proceedings. Under Article 393 4 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within one month from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned. Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser were to be dismissed.\n22. Article 393 1 of the Code listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged. It read as follows:\n\u201cThe cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds:\n(1) a breach of substantive law on account of its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application;\n(2) a breach of procedural provisions if the defect in question could significantly affect the outcome of the case.\u201d\n##### 3. Appeals against interlocutory decisions\n23. Article 394 of the Code of Civil Procedure guarantees the parties to proceedings the right to appeal against a decision of the first-instance court terminating the proceedings. An interlocutory appeal (za\u017calenie) of this kind is also available against certain interlocutory decisions specified in this provision. An appeal lies against a refusal of exemption from court fees and likewise against a refusal of legal aid, where such decisions have been given by a first-instance court.\n24. No appeal lies where such decisions are given by an appellate court.\n##### 4. Relevant provisions of social insurance law\n25. Section 29(1)(a) of the 1983 Ordinance of the Minister of Labour and Social Policy of 5 August 1983 (Journal of Laws No. 47, item 214), as amended in 1990, provided that no medical examination could be organised with a view to reassessing the medical condition of persons who had been declared unfit to work and who had been in receipt of a disability pension for longer than ten years.\nThis Ordinance was repealed with effect from 1 September 1997.\n26.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\n35. The applicant complained that the refusal to grant her a survivor\u2019s pension, on the ground that her marriage solemnised according to the rites of the Roma minority to which she belonged had no civil effects, infringed the principle of non-discrimination recognised by Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The provisions in question read as follows:\nArticle 14 of the Convention\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n36. The Court finds that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n37. The applicant observed that the Government had not explained why her situation had been regarded as a \u201cmore uxorio\u201d cohabitation and not as a marriage which was null and void but believed in good faith to exist, and which might entitle her, as surviving spouse, to a survivor\u2019s pension. She pointed out that there had been no reason for her to believe that the welfare entitlements she had enjoyed during her husband\u2019s life would be withdrawn from her after his death.\n38. The applicant emphasised that, in other cases, the inexistence of a \u201clegal\u201d marriage had not precluded the granting of such a pension: under the General Social Security Act a pension entitlement was granted, in the event of the nullity of a marriage, to a spouse who had shown good faith. In addition, case-law afforded a pension entitlement to couples who believed in the existence of a marriage even though it was not registered civilly, to couples who were prevented from legally marrying because of the impossibility of divorce, or to couples who did not marry because it was against their beliefs.\n(b) The Government\n39. The Government contested that argument. They took the view that, the law applicable to the applicant being the same for all Spanish nationals, there had been no discrimination based on ethnic origin or any other reason and that the alleged difference in treatment could be explained by the fact that the applicant had not married M.D. but had had a more uxorio relationship with him.\n40. The Government emphasised that there was no obligation to treat in the same manner those who had complied with the statutory formalities and those who, without being prevented from doing so, had not complied with them. The statutory requirement that there had to be a legal marital relationship for a survivor\u2019s pension entitlement to be granted did not constitute discrimination on racial or ethnic grounds. The refusal to grant the said pension to the applicant stemmed solely from her free and voluntary decision not to observe the statutory formalities of marriage, which were not based on the fact of belonging to a particular race, nor on the traditions, habits or customs of a particular ethnic group to the detriment of others. Those formalities did not therefore constitute direct or indirect discrimination against the Roma community.\n(c) The third party\n41. Uni\u00f3n Roman\u00ed pointed out that Roma marriage was no different to any other types of marriage. It explained that Roma marriage existed when a man and a woman expressed their intention to live together and their desire to found a family, which was the foundation of the Roma community. It took the view that it was disproportionate for the Spanish State, having issued the applicant and her family with a family record book", "001-96181": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF ALMESBERGER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The national automated register of sex offenders (\u201cthe Sex Offenders Register\u201d \u2013 FIJAIS), which was established in 2004, is a criminal identification register similar to the national fingerprint database (FAED), the national genetic database (FNAEG) and the national criminal records (CJN), the last of which have been in existence the longest. An information paper on police registers tabled before the National Assembly on 24 March 2009 noted an upsurge in the number of such registers. The working party chaired by Mr Alain Bauer noted that there were around forty-five in 2008 compared with thirty-four in 2006, and that another dozen or so were \u201cin the pipeline\u201d.\nThe Ministry of Justice is responsible for and manages the Sex Offenders Register. It is maintained by the National Criminal Records Department in Nantes, under the supervision of the judge in charge of the national criminal records.\n#### A. The Sex Offenders Register\n17. The national automated register of perpetrators of sexual crimes was established by Law no. 2004-204 of 9 March 2004 on adaptation of the justice system to changing trends in criminal offending. It is aimed at preventing repeat sexual offences, making it easier to identify offenders and allowing them to be traced quickly at any time.\nA series of transitional measures lay down detailed arrangements for the placement on the register of persons who committed such offences prior to the entry into force of the above-mentioned Law. The provisions are applicable to persons who committed such offences before the date of promulgation of the Law but were the subject, after that date, of one of the decisions referred to in Article 706-53-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 18 below). They can also be applied to persons serving a custodial sentence before the promulgation of the Law (at the request of the public prosecutor).\n##### 1. The Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d)\n18. The relevant provisions of the CCP read as follows:\nArticle 706-47\n\u201cThe provisions of this Title shall apply to proceedings concerning the murder, whether or not premeditated, of a minor preceded or accompanied by rape, torture or acts of barbarity or for the offences of sexual assault or sexual abuse of a minor, living on the immoral earnings of a minor or paying a minor for sexual services ...\nThese provisions shall also apply to proceedings concerning the crime of murder, whether or not premeditated, accompanied by torture or acts of barbarity, the crimes of torture or acts of barbarity and the crime of murder, whether or not premeditated, committed as a repeat offence.\u201d\nArticle 706-53-1\n\u201cThe national automated register of perpetrators of sexual or violent crimes shall constitute a database of personal information held by the Criminal Records Department under the authority of the Minister of Justice and the supervision of a judge. In order to prevent repeat offences of the kind referred to in Article 706-47 and to facilitate identification of the perpetrators of such offences, the information referred to in Article 706-53-2 shall be gathered, stored and communicated to authorised persons in accordance with the arrangements laid down in this Chapter.\u201d\nArticle 706-53-2\n\u201cSubject to the provisions of the last paragraph of this Article, and in so far as they relate to one or more of the offences referred to in Article 706-47, details of an individual\u2019s identity and home address or successive home addresses and, where applicable, other residences shall be entered in the register where the individual concerned has been the subject of:\n1. A conviction, whether or not final, including conviction in absentia, or a declaration of guilt accompanied by an order dispensing him or her from sentence or adjourning sentence;\n2. A decision, whether or not final, delivered under sections 8, 15, 15-1, 16, 16 bis and 28 of Ordinance no. 45-174 of 2 February 1945 on juvenile delinquency;\n3.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Legal aid\n13. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a court should give all necessary procedural instructions to a party acting without a lawyer and, in particular, should indicate the consequences of that party's acts or failures to act.\n14. Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family's standard of living.\n15. Pursuant to Article 117 of the Code, persons exempted from court fees may request that legal aid be granted to them. The court will then request the relevant District Bar Association or the District Chamber of Legal Advisers to assign an advocate or a legal adviser to the claimant's case.\n#### B. The cassation appeal\n16. At the material time a party to civil proceedings could lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a final judicial decision of a second\u2011instance court which terminated the proceedings.\n17. Under Article 393 4 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within one month from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned. Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser would be rejected.\n#### C. Relevant provisions of the Bar Act\n18. Article 1 of the Bar Act of 1982, as amended, reads, insofar as relevant:\n\u201c1. The Bar is established to provide legal assistance, co-operate in protecting a person's rights and freedoms as well as to formulate and apply the law.\n2.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n110. Section 75 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedures provides, inter alia, that an action can be lodged with the Administrative Court if the administrative authorities fail without sufficient justification to decide upon an administrative appeal or an application for the performance of an administrative act within a reasonable time-limit, in general three months.0\n111. According to section 65 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Administrative Court Procedure the court may, on request or of its own motion, summon persons whose interests may be affected by the court's decision to proceedings as third parties (einfache Beiladung). Under section 65 \u00a7 2 of that Code the court shall summon third persons to the proceedings as third parties if they are involved in the dispute in such a way that the court can render only a uniform decision vis-\u00e0-vis the main parties and the third party together (necessary third-party summons). Thus, once the conditions for a necessary third-party summons have been fulfilled, the court is obliged to summon the third party to the proceedings. The position of third party becomes effective from the moment the court's summons is pronounced or served on the third party.\n112. Section 128 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the court may render a decision without an oral hearing if the parties have given their consent to this purely written procedure (sentence 1). In such a case, the court must soon set a time-limit by which the parties are allowed to make their submissions, and must set a date for the pronouncement of a decision (sentence 2). The court shall no longer be able to render a decision without an oral hearing if a period of three months has expired following the party's consent (sentence 3).\n113.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Constitutional provisions\n10. Article 9 of the Constitution, which was adopted by the National Assembly on 2 April 1997 and entered into force on 17 October 1997, states:\n\u201cThe Republic of Poland shall respect international law binding upon it.\u201d\nArticle 45 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution reads:\n\u201cEveryone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court.\u201d\nChapter VIII of the Constitution contains provisions related to the judiciary. Article 175\u00a7 1 of the Constitution provides:\n\u201cThe administration of justice in the Republic of Poland shall be implemented by the Supreme Court, the ordinary courts, administrative courts and military courts.\u201d\nArticle 177 of the Constitution states:\n\u201cThe ordinary courts shall implement the administration of justice concerning all matters save for those statutorily reserved for other courts.\u201d\nArticle 184, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe Supreme Administrative Court and other administrative courts shall exercise, to the extent specified by statute, control over the performance of public administration.\u201d\n#### B. The Agreement of 16 October 1991 and the establishment of the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation (first compensation scheme)\n11. On 16 October 1991 the Governments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Poland concluded an agreement on the basis of which the German Government declared that, prompted by humanitarian considerations, it was prepared to contribute DEM 500 million for the benefit of the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation. The Foundation was to be established by the Government of Poland with a view to providing financial assistance to victims of Nazi persecution who had been particularly wronged. The Foundation was to determine the necessary criteria for the granting of payments, having regard both to serious damage to the victims\u2019 health and to difficulties in their current financial situation. The Government of Poland declared that it would not pursue further individual claims by Polish citizens arising out of Nazi persecution. Both Governments indicated that their agreement should not amount to limitation of the rights of citizens of either country.\n12. Subsequently, on 27 November 1991, the Minister\u2013Head of the Cabinet Office (Minister \u2013 Szef Urz\u0119du Rady Ministr\u00f3w) acting as a Founder, made a declaration before the State Notary on the establishment of the Foundation. He declared that, acting on the initiative of the Government of the Republic of Poland and on behalf of the State Treasury, he was establishing the Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation. The Foundation\u2019s aim was to provide assistance to the victims of Nazi persecution and to undertake other activities for the benefit of those persons. The Minister also declared that the Foundation\u2019s capital fund consisted of DEM 500 million, contributed by the German Government to the Polish Government. The Polish-German Reconciliation Foundation was established in accordance with the Foundations Act of 6 April 1984, which regulates the activities of foundations in Poland. In principle, supervision of a foundation\u2019s activities is exercised by the regional governor (Wojewoda) or the competent minister.\n13. The Foundation\u2019s organs were the Supervisory Board (Rada Nadzorcza) and the Management Board (Zarz\u0105d). The members of those organs were appointed and dismissed by the Founder (government minister) who exercised full control in this respect. The two other organs of the Foundation were the Verification Commission (Komisja Weryfikacyjna), and the Appeal Commission (Odwo\u0142awcza Komisja Weryfikacyjna).\n#### C. Compensation scheme for slave and forced labourers (second compensation scheme)\n14. From 1998 to 2000 international negotiations took place on the issue of compensation for persons subjected to slave or forced labour by Nazi Germany. The government of Poland was one of the parties to these negotiations. They were prompted by a number of lawsuits against certain German companies before the courts in the United States in which compensation was sought on account of forced labour during the Second World War. The German companies against which the lawsuits had been brought wished to bring them to an end and secure legal peace. The negotiations concluded on 17 July 2000 with the adoption of a Joint Statement which was signed by all the parties to the negotiations, including the government of Poland.\n15. The parties to the Joint Statement acknowledged the intention of the Government of Germany and of the German companies concerned to accept moral and historic responsibility arising from the use of slave and forced labourers and from other injustices committed during the National Socialist era and the Second World War. They affirmed their consensus of 17 December 1999 on the establishment of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation, which was to be a means of providing funds for victims from central and eastern Europe, most of whom had benefited little from prior German compensation and restitution programmes. The parties to the Joint Statement further agreed to base their decisions regarding the distribution of funds on the eligibility criteria set out in the German Foundation Act.\n16. According to the Joint Statement, the Government of Germany and the German companies concerned undertook to contribute DEM 5 thousand million to the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation. The Joint Statement stipulated that the governments of the participating central and eastern European States, including Poland, and the government of Israel agreed to implement the necessary specific measures within the framework of their national legal systems to achieve legal peace.\n17. Subsequently, on 2 August 2000 the German parliament enacted the Law on the creation of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future Foundation (Gesetz zur Errichtung einer Stiftung \u201cErinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft\u201d; the German Foundation Act; the GFA). It came into force on 12 August 2000. However, the disbursement of payments only started on 30 May 2001, once the ", "001-97058": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF MAGOCH v.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 6 \u00a7 1 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION ARISING FROM THE LENGTH OF THE COURT OF SESSION PROCEEDINGS\n13. The applicant principally complained that the length of the proceedings before the Court of Session challenging the statutory notices was incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He also referred to Article 13 of the Convention in this connection.\nArticle 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n14. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n15. The Government contended that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as he did not complain about the alleged unreasonable length of the proceedings before the Outer and Inner Houses of the Court of Session. First, before the Outer House, when the parties could not agree to the future procedure in the case, the applicant could have enrolled a motion for the court to decide on future procedure. Second, in October 1998, he had failed to seek early disposal of the first defenders\u2019 reclaiming motion or to have it heard as a single bill (a motion which can be heard in a short period of time) rather than on the Summar Roll. The brief and interlocutory nature of the appeal meant it would have been well-suited to being heard promptly in this way. Third, when the first defenders failed to apply for a hearing before the Inner House, the applicant failed to apply for the reclaiming motion to be refused for want of insistence. He could also have requested that the first defenders be asked to explain to the court whether they intended to insist upon their appeal.

Turkey (no. 35811/97, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 44, 2 August 2005), G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey judgment ([GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-V), and Demirci v. Turkey (no. 21843/02, \u00a7 14, 3 June 2008).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. In the application form the applicant alluded to having been subjected to torture while he was held in police custody.\n30. The Court considers that the applicant's submission should be examined under Article 3, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n31. The Government maintained that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, as he had failed to make proper use of the administrative-law remedy available to him in domestic law. They further asked the Court to dismiss this part of the application for failure to comply with the six-month time-limit under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n32. The Court considers it unnecessary to determine whether the applicant exhausted domestic remedies or complied with the six-month rule, within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since this complaint is in any event inadmissible for the following reasons.\n33. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment must be supported by appropriate evidence (see, in particular, Tanr\u0131kulu and Others v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. Rule 19.17(4) of the Criminal Procedure Rules SI 2005/384 (\u201cthe Criminal Procedure Rules\u201d) provides as follows:\n\u201cThe person concerned [when the prosecution appeal against a decision to grant bail] shall not be entitled to be present at the hearing of the appeal unless he is acting in person or, in any other case of an exceptional nature, a judge of the Crown Court is of the opinion that the interests of justice require him to be present and gives him leave to be so.\u201d\n23. Section 1 (1) of the Bail (Amendment) Act 1993 (\u201cthe 1993 Act\u201d) grants the prosecution the right to appeal to the Crown Court against a decision by magistrates to grant bail in cases concerning particularly serious charges or convictions. Section 1 (3) of the 1993 Act provides that such an appeal may only be made where, prior to the grant of bail, the prosecution has made representations that bail should not be allowed. The appeal itself is by way of a re-hearing of the application for bail and the judge hearing the appeal may remand the accused person in custody or grant bail subject to such conditions as he thinks fit (section 1 (9) of the 1993 Act).\n24. Section 1 (4) of the 1993 Act requires that the prosecution give oral notice of its intention to appeal to the court which has granted bail. This must be done at the conclusion of the proceedings in which bail has been granted and before the release from custody of the person concerned. Section 1 (5) gives the prosecution two hours within which to serve written notice of appeal upon both the court which has granted bail and the defendant. If it fails to do so, the appeal is deemed to be disposed of (section 1 (7)). Section 1 (6) of the 1993 Act states that upon receipt of the prosecution's oral notice of appeal against the decision to grant bail, the magistrates' court shall remand the person concerned in custody, until the appeal is determined. Once the proper notice has been given, section 1 (8) of the 1993 Act provides that the hearing of the appeal must commence within two working days of the first instance proceedings at which oral notice of appeal is given.\nTHE LAW\n### I.

The applicant complained that the Deputy District Judge did not meet the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention as he was not able to give a binding ruling on bail, as the prosecution were entitled to appeal against his decision. She also complained that the fact that she was not permitted to attend the hearing of the prosecution's appeal against bail breached her rights under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. She further complained that the refusal in question gave rise to a violation of her rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\nArticle 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.

Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nJosep Casadevall, President,\nElisabet Fura,\nCorneliu B\u00eersan,\nAlvina Gyulumyan,\nEgbert Myjer,\nIneta Ziemele,\nAnn Power, judges,\nand Santiago Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 March 2010,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Reindeer Husbandry Act\n39. The nature and scope of Sami rights to land and water are governed by the Reindeer Husbandry Act. A person of Sami descent may use land and water in order to maintain himself and his reindeer (section 1). The reindeer herding right is a usufruct of economic value founded on prescription from time immemorial (section 1, subsection 2). It is to be exercised irrespective of contracts and free of charge, without limitations in time and space and on land belonging to the State as well as to private subjects, in accordance with the conditions laid down in sections 15-25 of the Act. These provisions also contain restrictions on the exercise of such rights depending, inter alia, on whether the land belongs to the State or to private subjects. The reindeer herding right includes the right of members of a Sami village to engage in hunting and fishing, to graze reindeer and to erect certain structures and buildings needed for reindeer herding, as well as to collect wood and timber from the forests. It pertains to all Sami, but may only be exercised by members of a Sami village.\n40. Section 3 of the Act defines the areas where reindeer herding may be conducted (rensk\u00f6tselomr\u00e5det). In so far as the county of J\u00e4mtland is concerned, herding may be carried out throughout the year on the so-called \u201creindeer grazing mountains\u201d (renbetesfj\u00e4llen) and in those areas within the county which, at the end of June 1992, belonged to the State and were made available specifically for reindeer grazing. Winter grazing may be carried out from 1 October to 30 April in such areas outside the reindeer grazing mountains where, since time immemorial, reindeer grazing has been conducted during certain times of the year.\nSection 3, subsection 2, defines \u201creindeer grazing land\u201d as land that has been declared to constitute reindeer grazing land through the process of delimitation of Crown lands (avvittring, that is, a process taking place between the 17th and the 20th centuries with the aim of separating private land from Crown land and imposing taxes on the former) or that has been used as such land since time immemorial. The notion of \u201creindeer grazing mountains\u201d refers to mountains reserved for the Sami for reindeer grazing through the process of delimitation of Crown lands and the areas which have since then been made available for extension of the mountain grazing areas.\n41. A Sami village is a geographical grazing area and an economic entity. Its main object is to manage reindeer herding within the grazing area of the village to the common benefit of its members (section 9). A village may acquire rights and undertake commitments and represents its members with regard to issues related to reindeer husbandry (section 10). The members of a Sami village are Sami who participate or have participated in reindeer herding within the community's grazing area, as well as their closest family members (section 11).\n#### B. Prescription from time immemorial\n42. As mentioned above, the reindeer herding right is based on prescription from time immemorial. This was specified in the Reindeer Husbandry Act through a 1993 amendment, following the Supreme Court's conclusion in the \u201cTaxed Mountains Case\u201d that the right to certain mountain areas i", "001-97995": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF AYHAN I\u015eIK v.

Section 34 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 provides that:\n\u201c(1) Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence, evidence is given that the accused\u2013\n(a) at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being questioned under caution by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom the offence had been committed, failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings;\n...\nbeing a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, subsection (2) below applies.\n(2) Where this subsection applies\n...\n(d) the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged,\nmay draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper.\n(3) Subject to any directions by the court, evidence tending to establish the failure may be given before or after evidence tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to have failed to mention.\n...\u201d\n28.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Applicable legislation\n##### 1. Subject access requests under the Data Protection Act (\u201cDPA\u201d) 1998\n21. Section 7(1) DPA grants individuals the right to request details of any information about them held by persons or organisations which record, store, or process personal data.\n22. Under section 28 DPA, personal data is exempt from disclosure under section 7(1) if an exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security.\n##### 2. The Human Rights Act 1998\n23. The HRA incorporates the Convention into United Kingdom law. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right, except where it is constrained to act in that way as a result of primary legislation which cannot be interpreted so as to be compatible with Convention rights. Under section 7(1), a person claiming that a public authority has acted unlawfully under section 6(1) may bring proceedings against it in the appropriate court or rely on the Convention right in any legal proceedings.\n24. Under section 4(2), if a court is satisfied that a provision of primary legislation is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. \u201cCourt\u201d, in section 4, is defined as meaning the Supreme Court; the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; the Court Martial Appeal Court; in Scotland, the High Court of Justiciary (sitting otherwise than as a trial court) or the Court of Session; or in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the High Court or the Court of Appeal. Section 4(6) clarifies that a declaration of incompatibility does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the legislative provision in question and is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.\n##### 3. Interception warrants\n25. Since 2 October 2000, the interception of communications has been regulated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (\u201cRIPA\u201d). The explanatory notes which accompany RIPA explain that the main purpose of RIPA is to ensure that investigatory powers are exercised in accordance with human rights.\n26. Section 71 RIPA provides for the adoption of codes of practice by the Secretary of State in relation to the exercise and performance of his powers and duties under the Act. Draft codes of practice must be laid before Parliament and are public documents. They can only enter into force in accordance with an order of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State can only make such an order if a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.\n27. Under section 72(1) RIPA, a person exercising or performing any power or duty relating to interception of communications must have regard to the relevant provisions of a code of practice. The provisions of a code of practice may, in appropriate circumstances, be taken into account by courts and tribunals under section 72(4) RIPA.\n28. The Interception of Communications Code of Practice (\u201cthe Code\u201d) entered into force on 1 July 2002. It is now available on the Home Office website.\na. The issue of an interception warrant\n29. Interception is permitted in several cases, exhaustively listed in section 1(5) RIPA. Section 1(5)(b), the relevant provision in the present case, provides that interception is lawful if authorised by an interception warrant. Any unlawful interception is a criminal offence under section 1(1).\n30. Section 2(2) defines \u201cinterception\u201d as follows:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this Act, but subject to the following provisions of this section, a person intercepts a communication in the course of its transmission by means of a telecommunication system if, and only if, he\u2013\n(a) so modifies or interferes with the system, or its operation,\n(b) so monitors transmissions made by means of the system, or\n(c) so monitors transmissions made by wireless telegraphy to or from apparatus comprised in the system,\nas to make some or all of the contents of the communication available, while being transmitted, to a person other than the sender or intended recipient of the communication.\u201d\n31. Section 5(1) allows the Secretary of State to issue a warrant authorising the interception of the communications described in the warrant. Under section 5(2), no warrant for interception of internal communications (i.e. communications within the United Kingdom) shall be issued unless the Secretary of State believes:\n\u201c(a) that the warrant is necessary on grounds falling within subsection (3); and\n(b) that the conduct authorised by the warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct.\n32. Section 5(3) provides:\n\u201cSubject to the following provisions of this section, a warrant is necessary on grounds falling within this subsection if it is necessary\u2013\n(a) in the interests of national security;\n(b) for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime; [or]\n(c) for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom ...\u201d\n33. The term \u201cnational security\u201d is not defined in RIPA. However, it has been clarified by the Interception of Communications Commissioner appointed under RIPA's predecessor (the Interception of Communications Act 1985) who, in his 1986 report, stated that he had adopted the following definition:\n\u201c[activities] which threaten the safety or well-being of the State, and which are intended to undermine or overthrow Parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means.\u201d\n34. Section 81(2)(b) RIPA defines \u201cserious crime\u201d as crime which satisfies one of the following criteria:\n\u201c(a) that the offence or one of the offences that is or would be constituted by the conduct is an offence for which a person who has attained the age of twenty-one and has no previous convictions could reasonably be expected to be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years or more;\n(b) that the conduct involves the use of violence, results in substantial financial gain or is conduct by a large number of persons in pursuit of a common purpose.\u201d\n35. Section 81(5) provides:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this Act detecting crime shall be taken to include\u2013\n(a) establishing by whom, for what purpose, by what means and generally in what circumstances any crime was committed; and\n(b) the apprehension of the person by whom any crime was committed;\nand any reference in this Act to preventing or detecting serious crime shall be construed accordingly ...\u201d\n36. Under section 5(4), the Secretary of State must, when assessing whether the requirements in section 5(2) are met, consider whether the information sought to be obtained under the warrant could reasonably be obtained by other means.\n37. Section 5(5) provides that a warrant shall not be considered necessary for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom unless the information which it is thought necessary to obtain is information relating to the acts or intentions of persons outside the British Islands.\n38. Section 7(2)(a) requires the Secretary of State personally to issue all warrants of the nature at issue in the present case, except in cases of urgency where he must nonetheless personally authorise the issuing of the warrant. Section 6(2) provides an exhaustive list of those who may apply for an interception warrant, including the heads of national intelligence bodies, heads of police forces and the Customs and Excise Commissioners.\n39. Paragraphs 2.4 to 2.5 of the Code provide additional guidance on the application of the proportionality and necessity test in section 5(2):\n\u201c2.4 Obtaining a warrant under the Act will only ensure that the interception authorised is a justifiable interference with an individual's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (the right to privacy) if it is necessary and proportionate for the interception to take place. The Act recognises this by first requiring that the Secretary of State believes that the authorisation is necessary on one or more of the statutory grounds set out in section 5(3) of the Act. This requires him to believe that it is necessary to undertake the interception which is to be authorised for a particular purpose falling within the relevant statutory ground.\n2.5 Then, if the interception is necessary, the Secretary of State must also believe that it is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by carrying it out. This involves balancing the intrusiveness of the interference, against the need for it in operational terms. Interception of communications will not be proportionate if it is excessive in the circumstances of the case or if the information which is sought could reasonably be obtained by other means. Further, all interception should be carefully managed to meet the objective in question and must not be arbitrary or unfair.\u201d\nb. The contents of an application and an interception warrant\n40. Section 8 sets out the requirements as to the contents of an interception warrant as regards the identification of the communications to be intercepted:\n\u201c(1) An interception warrant must name or describe either\u2013\n(a) one person as the interception subject; or\n(b) a single set of premises as the premises in relation to which the interception to which the warrant relates is to take place.\n(2) The provisions of an interception warrant describing communications the interception of which is authorised or required by the warrant must comprise one or more schedules setting out the addresses, numbers, apparatus or other factors, or combination of factors, that are to be used for identifying the communications that may be or are to be intercepted.\n(3) Any factor or combination of factors set out in accordance with subsection (2) must be one that identifies communications which are likely to be or to include\u2013\n(a) communications from, or intended for, the person named or described in the warrant in accordance with subsection (1); or\n(b) communications originating on, or intended for transmission to, the premises so named or described.\u201d\n41. Paragraph 4.2 of the Code provides:\n\u201cAn application for a warrant is made to the Secretary of State. Interception warrants, when issued, are addressed to the person who submitted the application. This person may then serve a copy upon any person who may be able to provide assistance in giving effect to that warrant. Each application, a copy of which must be retained by the applicant, should contain the following information:\n\u2022 Background to the operation in question.\n\u2022 Person or premises to which the application relates (and how the person or premises feature in the operation).\n\u2022 Description of the communications to be intercepted, details of the communications service provider(s) and an assessment of the feasibility of the interception operation where this is relevant.\n\u2022 Description of the conduct to be authorised as considered necessary in order to carry out the interception, where appropriate.\n\u2022 An explanation of why the interception is considered to be necessary under the provisions of section 5(3).\n\u2022 A consideration of why the conduct to be authorised by the warrant is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct.\n\u2022 A consideration of any unusual degree of collateral intrusion and why that intrusion is justified in the circumstances.

The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to comply with the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention since she had not exhausted all available domestic remedies in respect of her complaints and had not filed her application with the Court within the six-month time\u2011limit. In the Government's opinion, the applicant could have availed herself of the remedies provided for by civil and administrative law in respect of her complaints of ill-treatment. Furthermore, she should have raised her complaint under Article 11 before the domestic authorities. Moreover, she should have lodged her application within six months of the alleged ill\u2011treatment.\n20. The Government also maintained that the applicant could no longer claim to be the victim of a violation of Articles 3 and 11 of the Convention, given that she had not been ill-treated and that she had been acquitted of the charges brought against her.\n21. The applicant maintained her allegations.\n22. Regarding the Government's reference to civil and administrative remedies, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected similar preliminary objections made in other cases (see, in particular, Atalay v. Turkey, no. 1249/03, \u00a7 28, 18 September 2008 and the case cited therein). The Court reaffirms its earlier conclusions that the remedies referred to by the Government cannot be regarded as sufficient where a Contracting State's obligations under Article 3 of the Convention are concerned, as their purpose is the award of damages rather than the identification and punishment of those responsible.

The applicant complained about the unfairness of the lustration proceedings, the infringement of his right of defence and the lack of equality of arms. In particular, he alleged that the material in his case had been classified as confidential, which had limited his right of access to it. Before the institution of the proceedings he had had no access to the case file prepared by the Commissioner. After the lustration proceedings had been instituted by the Warsaw Court of Appeal the applicant could consult the documents only in the secret registry of the lustration court. The limitations on access were not applicable to the Commissioner of the Public Interest. Thus, the applicant was placed at a significant disadvantage vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis the Commissioner who had unlimited access to the file in his secret registry. The applicant invoked Article 6 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, reads:\n\u201c1.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE THE APPLICATION OUT OF THE COURT\u2019S LIST\n35. In their oral pleadings, the Government argued that the Registered Partnership Act allowed same-sex couples to obtain a legal status adjusted as far as possible to the status conferred by marriage on different-sex couples. They submitted that the matter might be regarded as being resolved and that it was justified to strike the application out of the Court\u2019s list. They relied on Article 37 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201c1. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings decide to strike an application out of its list of cases where the circumstances lead to the conclusion that\n...\n(b) the matter has been resolved; ...\n...\nHowever, the Court shall continue the examination of the application if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto so requires.\u201d\n36. To conclude that Article 37 \u00a7 1 (b) of the Convention applies to the instant case, the Court must answer two questions in turn: firstly, it must ask whether the circumstances complained of directly by the applicants still obtain and, secondly, whether the effects of a possible violation of the Convention on account of those circumstances have also been redressed (see Shevanova v. Latvia (striking out) [GC], no. 58822/00, \u00a7 45, 7 December 2007).\n37. The Court observes that the crux of the applicants\u2019 complaint is that, being a same-sex couple, they do not have access to marriage. This situation still obtains following the entry into force of the Registered Partnership Act. As the Government themselves pointed out, the said Act allows same-sex couples to obtain only a status similar or comparable to marriage, but does not grant them access to marriage, which remains reserved for different-sex couples.\n38. The Court concludes that the conditions for striking the case out of its list are not met and therefore dismisses the Government\u2019s request.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 12 OF THE CONVENTION\n39. The applicants complained that the authorities\u2019 refusal to allow them to contract marriage violated Article 12 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cMen and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right.\u201d\nThe Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n40. The Court observes that the Government raised the question whether the applicants\u2019 complaint fell within the scope of Article 12, given that they were two men claiming the right to marry. The Government did not argue, however, that the complaint was inadmissible as being incompatible ratione materiae. The Court agrees that the issue is sufficiently complex not to be susceptible of being resolved at the admissibility stage.\n41. The Court considers, in the light of the parties\u2019 submissions, that the complaint raises serious issues of fact and of law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes, therefore, that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n42. The Government referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling in the present case, noting that the latter had had regard to the Court\u2019s case-law and had not found a violation of the applicants\u2019 Convention rights.\n43. In their oral pleadings before the Court, the Government maintained that both the clear wording of Article 12 and the Court\u2019s case-law as it stood indicated that the right to marry was by its very nature limited to different\u2011sex couples. They conceded that there had been major social changes in the institution of marriage since the adoption of the Convention, but there was not yet any European consensus on granting same-sex couples the right to marry, nor could such a right be inferred from Article 9 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (\u201cthe Charter\u201d). Despite the difference in wording, the latter referred the issue of same-sex marriage to national legislation.\n44. The applicants argued that in today\u2019s society civil marriage was a union of two persons which encompassed all aspects of their lives, while the procreation and education of children was no longer a decisive element. As the institution of marriage had undergone considerable changes there was no longer any reason to refuse same-sex couples access to marriage. The wording of Article 12 did not necessarily have to be read in the sense that men and women only had the right to marry a person of the opposite sex. Furthermore, the applicants considered that the reference in Article 12 to the relevant \u201cnational laws\u201d could not mean that States were given unlimited discretion in regulating the right to marry.\n##### 2. The third-party interveners\u2019 submissions\n45. The United Kingdom Government asserted that the Court\u2019s case-law as it stood considered Article 12 to refer to the \u201ctraditional marriage between persons of the opposite biological sex\u201d (see Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom, 30 July ", "001-99863": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF MLADOSCHOVITZ v.

In principle, an application for an enforcement order (Exekutionsbewilligung) can only be made when the civil right to be enforced is established with final effect; such a decision establishing a civil right is called a fiat of execution (Exekutionstitel).\n12. If after a fiat of execution has been passed, new facts emerge which vitiate or weaken the enforceable claim, the debtor can bring an action under Section 35 of the Enforcement Act. If successful, such an action will set aside the fiat of execution. In the proceedings, the Code on Civil Procedure (Zivilproze\u00dfordnung) will apply.\n13.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The historical position on release on parole\n22. Under sections 59-61 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, all determinate and indeterminate sentence prisoners were eligible for discretionary release on licence after serving specified minimum amounts of their sentences. In both cases, once the Parole Board had recommended release, the Secretary of State had discretion to decide whether to release a prisoner.\n#### B. The position on release on parole at the relevant time\n23. The law regarding release of prisoners on parole was subsequently changed by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d) and the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Act\u201d), as amended.\n24. Sections 33 and 34 of the 1991 Act created a duty to release fixed term and discretionary life prisoners once they had served a specified period of detention. Section 33 provided, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cDuty to release short-term and long-term prisoners\n(1) As soon as a short-term prisoner has served one-half of his sentence, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State\u2014\n(a) to release him unconditionally if that sentence is for a term of less than twelve months; and\n(b) to release him on licence if that sentence is for a term of twelve months or more.\n(2) As soon as a long-term prisoner has served two-thirds of his sentence, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to release him on licence.\n...\n25. Section 33(5) defined \u201cshort-term\u201d and \u201clong-term\u201d prisoners:\n\u201cIn this Part\u2014\n'long-term prisoner' means a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of four years or more;\n'short-term prisoner' means a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than four years.\u201d\n26. Section 34 dealt with the early release of discretionary life prisoners:\n\u201cDuty to release discretionary life prisoners\n(1) A life prisoner is a discretionary life prisoner for the purposes of this Part if\u2014\n(a) his sentence was imposed for a violent or sexual offence the sentence for which is not fixed by law; and\n(b) the court by which he was sentenced for that offence ordered that this section should apply to him as soon as he had served a part of his sentence specified in the order.\n...\n(3) As soon as, in the case of a discretionary life prisoner\u2014\n(a) he has served the part of his sentence specified in the order ...; and\n(b) the [Parole] Board has directed his release under this section,\nit shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to release him on licence.\u201d\n27. Section 35 provided for an additional discretionary power to release long-term prisoners before the two-thirds point of their sentence and provided that:\n\u201c(1) After a long-term prisoner has served one-half of his sentence, the Secretary of State may, if recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, release him on licence.\u201d\n28. Section 50 provided a power for the Secretary of State to reduce the period of detention which had to be served before long-term prisoners became entitled to release upon a recommendation of the Parole Board by converting his discretionary power set out in section 35 into a duty in relation to a specified class of prisoners. It provided that:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the [Parole] Board, may by order made by statutory instrument provide that, in relation to such class of case as may be specified in the order, the provisions of this Part specified in subsections (2) to (4) below shall have effect subject to the modifications so specified.\n(2) In section 35 above, in subsection (1) for the word 'may' there shall be substituted the word 'shall' ...\u201d\n29. The Secretary of State exercised the power provided to him under section 50 of the 1991 Act on two occasions. Under the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1992 his section 35 discretion to release long\u2011term prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than seven years was transformed into a duty. The subsequent Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998 transformed the discretion into a duty for prisoners serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than fifteen years. For those serving sentences of fifteen years or more, the Secretary of State retained his discretion to order early release after the half\u2011way point and before two-thirds of the sentence had been served.\n30. Section 28 of the 1997 Act was originally enacted and later amended following judgments of this Court in Hussain v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I and Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002\u2011IV.

The issue of compensation for property taken over by the State under the 1945 Decree was governed, until 1 August 1985, by the Expropriation of Property (Conditions and Procedures) Act of 12 March 1958 (Ustawa o zasadach i trybie wyw\u0142aszczania nieruchomo\u015bci). Section 53(1) of this Act provided as follows:\n\u201cThe provisions of this Act concerning compensation for expropriated property shall apply where relevant to compensation for agricultural land ... which became the State's property following the [1945 Decree] should its former owners or their legal successors who run the farms concerned be deprived of the use of the land in question after the entry into force of this Act.\u201d\n29.

JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONS\n28. Having regard to the similar subject matter of the applications, the Court finds it appropriate to join them.\n### II. ADMISSIBILITY\n#### A. The victim status of the applicant\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The Government\n29. The Government contested the admissibility of the applications, alleging that they were actio popularis in nature. They stated that the domestic courts had dismissed the applicant\u2019s actions on the ground that the expressions in the book and the definitions in the dictionary were of a general character and did not personally affect all Roma people. The Government stated that, in particular, the applicant had failed to show that he was personally affected by the allegedly discriminatory remarks.\n(b) The applicant\n30. The applicant alleged that because of his Roma origin the discriminatory remarks contained in the book and the dictionary had caused him non-pecuniary damage and as a result he should be considered as having victim status.\n(c) The Greek Helsinki Monitor\n31. The Greek Helsinki Monitor stated that any member of an ethnic group allegedly targeted by generally discriminatory expressions based on race had the status of victim, as such expressions created prejudice against every member of that group. Referring to the judgment in the case of Micallef v. Malta (no. 17056/06, 15 January 2008), they further stated that the Court\u2019s protection should be no less than that afforded under the domestic system: where a person\u2019s victim status had been recognised domestically it could not be refused by the Court.\n##### 2.

The Court reiterates that, according to Article 34 of the Convention, the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols th"}
