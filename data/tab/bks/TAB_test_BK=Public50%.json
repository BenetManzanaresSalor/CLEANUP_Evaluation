Lorenzen, President,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr R. T\u00fcrmen,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMrs N. Vaji\u0107,\nMrs S. Botoucharova,\nMrs E. Steiner, judges,\nand Mr S. Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 15 May 2003 and on 13 May 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained that the proceedings on compensation had not been concluded within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they had lasted almost seven years. The relevant parts of Article 6 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...\u201d\n20. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the \u201creasonable length\u201d requirement laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 began on 2 and 6 March 1989 for Mr Bahattin Sar\u0131soy and Mr Osman \u00c7a\u011flayan respectively, on 10 April 1989 for Mr Yusuf \u00c7am\u00e7a and on 1 June 1989 for Mr Galip Yalman. They ended on 30 May 1996 when the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicants\u2019 second appeal. The period under consideration thus lasted approximately seven years.\n21. The Government submitted that in order to decide on the compensation issue the Sinop Assize Court had to request the case files from the courts which had decided on the applicants\u2019 detention on remand. They further maintained that the applicants\u2019 case had involved several appeal stages. They referred in this connection to the case-law of the Court which establishes that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings depends, among other things, on the particular circumstances of the case (Konig v. Germany, judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, \u00a7 99, and Ya\u011fc\u0131 and Sarg\u0131n v. Turkey, judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 139, \u00a7 59). They concluded that bearing in mind the number of documents which had to be requested from other courts and the several appeal stages involved, the length of the proceedings had not been excessive.\n22. The applicants contended that the need to obtain evidence from other courts was not sufficient to justify the length of the proceedings. They maintained that requesting documents or case-files from other courts was a common occurrence in court proceedings. If this procedure caused a delay in the proceedings, it had to be concluded that there had been a serious problem in the trial system.\n23. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among others, Sekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 26518/95, \u00a7 35, 22 January 2004, and Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, \u00a7 33, 17 February 2004).\n24. The Court considers that the subject matter of the litigation, namely the determination of the amount of compensation to be paid to the applicants for their unjustified detention on remand, was not particularly complex. It further notes that the cases concerning compensation claims brought under Law no. 466 are examined by the competent courts by way of a written procedure.\n25. As regards the conduct of the applicants, the Court observes that it does not appear that they significantly contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n26. As to the conduct of the authorities, the Court observes that the first instance court took more than four years to render its judgment and that this delay has not been satisfactorily explained by the Government. Their argument concerning the number of documents which had to be requested from other courts is not sufficient to explain the delay in question. The Court reiterates in this connection that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their legal systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of the requirements of that provision, including the obligat", "001-61253": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF PRICE and LOWE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Applications nos. 43185/98 and 43186/98)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n29 July 2003\nFINAL\n03/12/2003\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Price and Lowe v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nSir Nicolas Bratza,\nMr Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr V. Butkevych,\nMrs W. Thomassen, judges,\nand Mrs S. Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 September 2002 and 8 July 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicants allege a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in connection with the length of the proceedings at issue. Article 6 provides, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n18. The proceedings began on 12 February 1986 when K issued a writ against the applicants and Mrs Price. They ended on 30 March 1998 when leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the House of Lords. They thus lasted a total of 12 years, one month and 18 days.\n19. The Government contend that the length of the proceedings before the setting down of the case for trial in 1994 was attributable wholly to the conduct of the parties, and that it was for the parties to apply for an appropriate direction if they had perceived it to be in their interests to do so. After the case had been set down, the case was dealt with by three instances between August 1994 and March 1998, and the only periods of delay for which the authorities were responsible were: one month when the commencement of the trial was adjourned; the six months\u2019 period before the Court of Appeal heard the case, during which time arrangements for the hearing were made, and the four months\u2019 period for delivery of the House of Lords\u2019 decision, during which period the judicial members of the House examined the complaints and the supporting material.\n20. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among other authorities, Comingersoll S.A. v. Portugal [GC], no. 35382/97, ECHR 2000-IV, \u00a7 19; Horvat v. Croatia, no. 51585/99, ECHR 2001-VIII, \u00a7 52).\n21. Once the case had been set down for trial, the case proceeded through three levels of jurisdiction in a little over three and a half years, notwithstanding the complicating factors that the plaintiff had been declared bankrupt and the property at issue was out of the jurisdiction. The Court is aware that some discussion between the parties may be necessary in civil proceedings to clarify the disputed issues, but considers that that period of three and a half years could have been considered a \u201creasonable time\u201d in this case.\n22. However, the question is whether the Government can be held responsible for the period preceding the trial of the action, even though the parties knew, or should have known, that the High Court would not act of its own motion. The Government refer, in this respect, to the case of Union Alimentaria Sanders v. Spain (judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 157, \u00a7 35).\n23. The Court has held on a number of occasions that a principle of domestic law or practice that the parties to civil proceedings are required to take the initiative with regard to the progress of the proceedings, does not dispense the State from complying with the requirement to deal with cases in a reasonable time (see Buchholz v Germany judgment of 6 May 1981, Series no. 42, p. 16, \u00a7 50; Guincho v. Portugal judgment of 10 July 1984, Series A no. 81, p. 14, \u00a7 32; Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, p. 11, \u00a7 25; Mitchell and Holloway v. the United Kingdom, no. 44808/98, judgment of 17 December 2002). The manner in which a State provides for mechanisms to comply with this requirement \u2013 whether by way of increasing the numbers of judges, or by automatic time-limits and directions, or by some other method \u2013 is for the State to decide. If a State lets proceedings continue beyond the \u201creasonable time\u201d prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention without doing anything to advance them, it will be responsible for the resultant delay.\n24. In the light of the preceding comments, and even though the applicants did not put the matter of the length of the pre-trial proceedings to the High Court, the Court finds that the proceedings in the present case were not dealt with within a \u201creasonable time\u201d, as required by Article 6 of the Convention.\n25. It follows that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n##### 2. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n27. Dr Price claimed pecuniary damage under a number of heads, including the sums paid to his domestic lawyers in connection with the purchase of the property, amounting to \u00a3346,885 on 30 December 2002, plus interest on his share of that figure. He also claimed secretarial costs of \u00a39,875, printer\u2019s costs of \u00a31,886.28, transport costs of \u00a31,400 and loss of earnings of about \u00a3300,000\n28. Dr Price next claimed non-pecuniary damage of \u00a3200 per week, making a total of \u00a3197,200 up to December 2002, and exemplary damages.\n29. Mrs Lowe claimed pecuniary damage of \u00a3232,093.44 in respect of money held by domestic lawyers, \u00a361,892.65 in respect of money paid in eviction proceedings in 2002, \u00a32,210 in respect of travel costs, and some \u00a31,800 in respect of costs in dealing with bankruptcy proceedings.\n30. She also claimed non-pecuniary damage of \u00a398,600 up to December 2002, and exemplary damages of, she suggested, \u00a3100,000.\n31. The Government noted that the admissible complaint in the present case related to the length of the proceedings only, and contended that much of the material submitted was irrelevant. They added that, as the applicants remained in possession of the properties throughout, the length of the proceedings was, with hindsight, to the applicants\u2019 benefit. Further, they underlined that the blame for the principal delay could not be laid at the door of the authorities, and that it had been open to the applicants to reduce that delay, but they chose not to. The Government considered that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction.\n32. As to the applicants\u2019 claims for pecuniary loss, the Court recalls that there must be a clear causal connection between the damage claimed by the applicant and the violation of the Convention (see, amongst other authorities, the Barber\u00e0, M", "001-66929": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MEHMET B\u00dcLENT YILMAZ AND \u015eAH\u0130N YILMAZ v.

Greve,\nMr K. Traja,\nMrs A. Gyulumyan, judges,\nand Mr V. Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n12. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. The applicants complained in the first place that they had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Izmir State Security Court. They further alleged that the national courts had convicted them on the basis of the statements that they had made to the police and to the investigating judge. The applicants finally maintained that they had been deprived of their right to defend themselves by a lawyer. In this connection, they invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n14. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicants\u2019 complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Izmir State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicants were complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, they should have lodged their application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 25 March 1997.\n15. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six-month rule in the past and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003, and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instance case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n16. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n17. In the light of its established case law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Izmir State Security Court\n18. The Government maintained that the state security courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicants could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Izmir State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on state security courts.\n19. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36).\n20. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicants who were prosecuted in a State Security Court for being a member of an illegal organisation and for aiding and abetting an armed gang respectively should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army ", "001-159913": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PRUS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime are set out in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Piechowicz v. Poland (no. 20071/07, \u00a7\u00a7 110-17, 17 April 2012), and Horych v. Poland (no. 13621/08, \u00a7\u00a7 49-56, 17 April 2012).\n16. The provisions of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences concerning the imposition of the regime on convicted persons read as follows:\nArticle 88 \u00a7 3\n\u201cA convicted person posing a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison shall be placed in a prison with a closed regime in conditions ensuring increased protection of society and the security of the prison.\u201d\nArticle 88a\n\u201c1. The convicted person referred to in Article 88 \u00a7 3 shall be placed in a designated wing or in a cell of a prison with a closed regime. A penitentiary judge shall be informed about this placement.\n2. The provisions of paragraph 1 above shall be applied to a convicted person whose characteristics, personal circumstances, motivations, behaviour when committing the offence, type of offence and its consequences, behaviour in prison, or degree of depravity pose a serious danger to society or to the security of a prison, and who:\n(2a) during the prior or current term of imprisonment posed a danger to the security of a prison or a remand centre in that he was a leader or an active participant in a collective remonstrance in a prison or a remand centre ...\u201d\n17. Article 88b of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences lays down specific arrangements applicable to convicted persons to whom the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime is applied. They are identical to those specified in Article 212b of the Code applicable to persons remanded in custody (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7 106).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that he had been unlawfully classified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and subjected to degrading treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n19. The Government contested that allegation.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that the prolonged imposition of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime had been in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In his opinion, there had been no reasonable grounds for applying the regime to him. He contested the allegation that he had been the leader of a collective protest. He had never been charged with or convicted of such an act. He admitted to having refused, on one occasion, to eat his breakfast while at the Opole Lubelskie Prison.\n22. The applicant submitted that he had been held mostly in solitary confinement. He referred to the prolonged and excessive isolation from his family, the outside world and other detainees, and to other restrictions, such as wearing \u201cjoined shackles\u201d, routine strip searches to which he had been subjected on a daily basis and, lastly, monitoring of his cell (including the sanitary facilities) via closed\u2011circuit television. The applicant stressed that all of his movements in the cell had been constantly monitored. The images had been recorded and stored for at least seven days. Every time he left or entered his cell, usually several times a day, he had been subjected to a degrading, exceptionally intrusive body search by at least three prison guards. Other inmates were often present during the strip search. Moreover, every time the applicant left his cell he was escorted and accompanied by guards, who were present also during medical examinations.\n##### 2. The Government\n23. The Government stressed that in the present case the treatment complained of had not attained the minimum level of severity required for a breach of Article 3.\n24. The Government maintained that the applicant had been classified as a \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d in accordance with the relevant legal provisions. He had planned and led a collective protest in the Opole Lubelskie Prison \u2013 the prisoners\u2019 hunger strike. Moreover, the domestic authority considered that the applicant had been demoralised and had had a negative influence on other detainees.\n25. The application of \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d status to the applicant had been reviewed after three months. As soon as the commission noticed an improvement in the applicant\u2019s attitude \u2013 on 28 April 2011, after five months and twenty-three days \u2013 it lifted the regime. In those circumstances, the Government considered that subjecting the applicant to the regime had been legitimate and necessary for preventing a risk of disturbance in the prison and maintaining prison security.\n26. The Government stressed that the regime had been imposed on the applicant for a very short period of time during which he had been provided with adequate stimulation and human contact. In particular, twice a week he had the right to visit a library and a room equipped with a computer, a television and other means of entertainment. He was also entitled to receive visits. The Government concluded that the treatment to which he had been subjected had not been incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. They invited the Court to find no violation of that provision.\n##### 3. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) General principles deriving from the Court\u2019s case-law\n27. The relevant general principles deriving from its case-law were recently summarised in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Piechowicz v. Poland (see Piechowicz, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 158-65) and Horych v. Poland (Horych, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 85-92).\n(b) Application of the above principles in the present case\n28. The Court notes that there is no dispute over the fact that from 5 November 2010 to 28 April 2011, that is, for five months and twenty-three days, the applicant was classified as a so\u2011called \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d and, in consequence, subjected to high\u2011security measures and various restrictions (see paragraphs 7-14 above). The main aspects of the regime raised by the applicant and specified below were not contested by the Government (see paragraphs 22 - 26 above). The details of the core aspects of the \u201cdangerous detainee\u201d regime were also extensively analysed in the Piechowicz judgment (cited above, \u00a7 166 with further references).\n29. The measures applied in the applicant\u2019s case comprised confinement in a special high-security prison wing and increased supervision of his movements within and outside the cell, which meant that he had to wear so\u2011called \u201cjoined shackles\u201d (handcuffs and fetters joined together with chains) whenever he was taken outside his cell. The measures involved his segregation from the prison community and restrictions on contact with his family. In addition, every time he left or entered his cell he was routinely subjected to a \u201cfull strip search\u201d \u2013 a thorough inspection of his body and clothes in which he was required to strip naked and make deep knee bends in order to enable an examination of his anus (see paragraph 22 above). The applicant submitted that the strip searches had been conducted in the corridor outside his cell and that other inmates had been able to see him. In addition, his cell, including the sanitary facilities, was constantly monitored via closed-circuit television.\nThe Government did not contest those allegations. They underlined that the applicant had had access to facilities in the prison such as a library and an entertainment room. Moreover, they submitted that he had had the right to receive family visits, without specifying whether any visits had taken place during the period in question (see paragraph 26 above).\n30. The parties disagreed on whether the adverse consequences of the imposition of the above measures on the applicant had been serious enough to attain the minimum level of severity required for a breach of Art", "001-61227": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MELLORS v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant complained of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in his trial and appeal. Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n25. The applicant was arrested on the rape charge on 30 October 1995 and his appeal was finally rejected on 22 July 1999. The criminal proceedings lasted three years, eight months and twenty three days.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n26. The applicant submitted that the case was not particularly complex. After conviction, his lawyers were not informed of the failure to cite the witness W. for some time and any delay or complication arising from that derived from the trial Advocate Depute's improper conduct in the first place. Thereafter, there was delay due to lack of availability of the Advocate Depute and the lack of time allocated in the appeal court. He did not refuse to go to the first listed appeal hearing; the prison unjustifiably preventing him from attending in civilian clothing. He claimed that there was no explanation for the delay of eight and a half months between the taking of W.'s evidence and the appeal hearing.\n27. The Government submitted that the period taken from 30 October 1995 to 22 July 1999 was reasonable in all the circumstances. The trial proceedings were complex and there were difficulties in obtaining samples from the applicant for forensic analysis. The appeal proceedings were also complex. Additional grounds of appeal were lodged and as a result the appeal court required to hear evidence, which had to be transcribed and reported upon. The appeal then had to be heard afresh on its merits. The applicant's conduct had contributed to the time taken, namely his refusal to come to court on 20 December 1996, the withdrawal of his counsel at the hearing set for 20 August 1998 and the request for adjournment of the appeal listed for January 1999. Any instances of delay by the authorities were minimal and were for justifiable reasons.\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court's case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities, and the importance of what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n29. The importance of what was at stake for the applicant, a serious criminal conviction and a sentence of imprisonment, is not in doubt.\n30. As regards the complexity of the proceedings, these involved forensic investigation prior to the trial and on appeal, complications arose when the applicant's' representatives raised new grounds of appeal in light of their discovery of events at trial concerning the witness W. It cannot be considered however that the proceedings presented any exceptional problems or difficulty.\n31. Taking the period to the applicant's conviction on 2 July 1996, the Court observes that this occurred slightly more than eight months after the applicant was first questioned. This does not disclose any undue delay.\n32. The appeal proceedings are more problematic, accounting for three years and two weeks of the overall period. The applicant lodged his intention to appeal promptly on 8 July 1996 but it was not for over another three years that the appeal was determined. This is, on the face of it, a long period for one instance of appeal.\n33. The Government have argued that the applicant was responsible for part of the delay. While it appears however that the applicant failed to attend the first listing of his appeal on 20 December 1996, this was due to the refusal of the prison to allow him to leave in the civilian clothing which he was entitled to wear at his hearin", "001-90749": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF ORPHANIDES v.

THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n#### A. The Government\u2019s objections\n##### 1. Objection of inadmissibility ratione materiae and ratione temporis\n12. The Government submitted that, according to the records of the \u201cTurkish-Cypriot Lands Office\u201d in Girne/Kyrenia, in 1974 the applicant had not been the owner of any property located in northern Cyprus. Nor was he, according to the same source, the owner of any property at the present time. Given that in 1974 the applicant had had no right or interest in relation to the properties at issue, no question of a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could arise. Even assuming that the applicant had acquired the properties in question in 1990, this would have happened sixteen years after the events of 1974 and three years after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. Therefore, he should have known that access to the properties was practically impossible and that the Turkish-Cypriot authorities had expropriated it.\n13. In the light of the above, the Government argued that the application was incompatible either ratione materiae or ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.\n2. Objection of inadmissibility on the grounds of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status\n14. In their further observations of 23 October 2003, the Government raised a preliminary objection concerning non-exhaustion of domestic remedies in the light of the law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the \u201cTRNC\u201d), which was adopted on 30 June 2003 (Law no. 49/2003). They also noted that since 23 April 2003, Greek Cypriots had free access to the north of the island by showing passports at specified crossing points. Administrative and judicial remedies in the \u201cTRNC\u201d were therefore accessible to them.\n15. Law no. 49/2003 provided for the establishment of an independent Immovable Property Determination, Evaluation and Compensation Commission with jurisdiction to award compensation for Greek-Cypriot immovable properties in the \u201cTRNC\u201d, on the basis of the market value on 20 July 1974, plus compensation for the loss of use, loss of income and increases in the value of property. The decisions of this Commission could be appealed to the High Administrative Court. Given the existence of this remedy, the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### B. The applicant\u2019s arguments\n16. The applicant observed that his parents had been the lawful owners of the properties in question in 1974. The Government could have ascertained this by consulting the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d. There had been the expectation that the applicant and his sister would, in due course, become the registered owners. Subsequent acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not deprive the applicant\u2019s parents of their title (see Loizidou v. Turkey, (merits), 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI). The applicant had become the legal owner of the properties on 20 April 1990 and this fact had been recorded by the official authorities of the Republic of Cyprus. The donation could not have been recorded by the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d because the authorities of the \u201cTRNC\u201d considered that the properties had already been expropriated. The Government could not rely on the records of the \u201cTurkish Cypriot Lands Office\u201d to contest the applicant\u2019s title.\n17. Even assuming that the applicant had had no property rights until 20 April 1990, that would only mean that there had not been a continuing violation of his rights under Article 1 Protocol No. 1 between 1974 and that date. In order to establish that there had been a violation of these rights after 20 April 1990, it was sufficient to show that the applicant had not been allowed to enjoy his properties from that date onwards. In any event, the applicant had a proprietary interest in the properties in 1974 and the house were he had been living had been his home. The fact that in 1990 the applicant might have known that he would not have enjoyed his property was irrelevant.\n18. The applicant alleged that Law no. 49/2003 was aimed at providing a false and illusory domestic remedy in order to avoid the property claims of Greek Cypriots being adjudicated by the European Court of Human Rights. Furthermore, the objection of non-exhaustion had been raised after the application had been declared admissible. Law no. 49/2003 had not existed at the time when the application was lodged, did not provide a sufficient and effective remedy, was discriminatory and took as its basis that the expropriation was lawful. Furthermore, the applicant could lose his victim status only if the violation of the Convention was expressly recognised and fully remedied by the respondent Government\u2019s authorities. This had not happened in the present case.\n#### C. Third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n19. The Government of Cyprus submitted that the applicant had acquired his rights as owner in 1990, after the deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition. He was therefore entitled to complain about any violation which had occurred after that date. The appropriate claimant in respect of earlier violations would have been the previous owner (the applicant\u2019s parents).\n20. The third-party intervener further submitted that the compensation available under Law no. 49/2003 did not alter the fact that the Court did not recognise the acts of the \u201cTRNC\u201d as expropriation. In any event, the said law did not provide any redress for breaches of Article 8 of the Convention and applied only to an extremely restricted category of violations of the right of property. It could not be considered an effective domestic remedy to be exhausted in relation to claims introduced or declared admissible before it was enacted or enforced. Finally, its provisions were incompatible with Articles 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention as well as with 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### D. The Court\u2019s assessment\n21. In its decision on the admissibility, the Court considered that the Government\u2019s objections that the application was incompatible ratione materiae and ratione temporis were closely linked to the substance of the applicant\u2019s complaints and that they should be examined together with the merits of the application.\n22. In their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, the Government did not contest the applicant\u2019s statement that his parents had been the owners of properties in the District of Kyrenia. They argued, however, that the properties at issue had subsequently been expropriated by the \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities. The Court recalls that in the case of Loizidou ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44 and 46) it held that it could not attribute legal validity for the purposes of the Convention to the provisions of Article 159 of the \u201cTRNC\u201d fundamental law, concerning the acquisition by the \u201cTRNC\u201d of the immovable properties considered to be abandoned on 13 February 1975. It furthermore considered that Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, had left their properties in the northern part of the island in 1974 could not be deemed to have lost title to their property. It follows that until 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents had still been the owners of the properties described in paragraph 10 above. They were therefore capable of transmitting ownership to their descendants.\n23. The Court further notes that on 20 April 1990 the applicant\u2019s parents donated half of their properties to the applicant and that the latter registered his titles in the Land Registry of the Republic of Cyprus (see paragraph 9 above). In spite of this, he has been unable to make use of and have access to his properties. At the relevant time, Turkey had already recognised the right of individual petition. It is also to be recalled that the Court had duly examined and rejected the objection of inadmissibility by reason of lack of effective control over northern Cyprus raised by the Turkish Government in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, \u00a7\u00a7 69-81, ECHR 2001-IV). It sees no reason to depart from its reasoning and conclusions in the instant case.\n24. Lastly, as regards the objections of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status raised by the Government in their further observations of 23 October 2003 relating to the Law on compensation for immovable properties located within the boundaries of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, the Court notes that these objections were raised after the application was declared admissible. They cannot, therefore, be taken into account at this stage of the proceedings (see Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, \u00a7 20, 31 July 2003).\n25. It follows that the Government\u2019s preliminary objections should be dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus had prevented him from having access to his properties situated in that part of the island.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n27. The Government submitted that, due to the relocation of the populations, it was necessary to facilitate the rehabilitation of Turkish-Cypriot refugees. The Greek-Cypriot side had taken similar measures in respect of abandoned Turkish-Cypriot properties in the southern part of the island.\n28. It would be unrealistic and highly dangerous to recognise the right of the applicant to violate the United Nations \u201cbuffer zone\u201d and have access to his alleged properties. Property rights and the question of reciprocal compensation had to be dealt with through negotiations, within the context of inter-communal talks. There was a public interest in not undermining these talks. The applicant\u2019s complaints had been the consequence of the political situation in Cyprus and not of the 1974 Turkish intervention.\n##### 2. The applicant\n29. The applicant argued that the interference with his property rights could not be justified under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The policies of the \u201cTRNC\u201d could not furnish a legitimate aim since the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d was an illegitimate act. In any event, the need to re-house displaced Turkish Cypriots could not justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that much of the property taken from Greek Cypriots had been used to house settlers from mainland Turkey. The fact that property rights had been one of the subjects under discussion in the inter-communal talks could not justify the taking of property without compensation.\n#### B. The third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n30. The Government of Cyprus observed that their Department of Lands and Surveys had provided certificates of affirmation to those persons who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title was entered in District Land Offices registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The \u201cTRNC\u201d authorities were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.\n31. The Government of Cyprus further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou ((merits), cited above), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### D. The Court\u2019s assessment\n32. The Court recalls that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64), it reasoned as follows:\n\u201c63. ... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.\n64. Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights which is imputable to Turkey.\nIt has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.\nNor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d\n33. In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (\u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189):\n\u201c187. The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cypriots to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n...\n189. .. there has been a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus are being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.\u201d\n34. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the conclusions which it reached in the Loizidou and Cyprus v. Turkey cases (op. cit.; see also Demades (merits), cited above, \u00a7 46).\n35. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been and continues to be a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that the applicant is denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of his properties as well as any compensation for the interference with his property rights.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\nThe applicant submitted that in 1974 he had had his home in Lapithos. As he had been unable to return there, he was the victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThis provision reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n36. The Government disputed this claim.\n37. The applicant submitted that, contrary to the applicant in the Loizidou case, he had had his principal residence in Lapithos. He claimed that any interference with his Article 8 rights had not been justified under the second paragraph of this provision.\n38. The Government of Cyprus submitted that where the applicant\u2019s properties constituted the person\u2019s home, there was a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\n39. The Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon the applicant\u2019s statement that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, he was regularly residing in Lapithos and that this house was treated by him and his family as a home.\n40. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the house where the applicant was living qualified as \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention at the time when the acts complained of took place.\n41. The Court observes that the present case differs from the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above) since, unlike Mrs Loizidou, the applicant actually had a home in northern Cyprus.\n42. The Court notes that since 1974 the applicant had been unable to gain access to and to use that home. In this connection, the Court recalls that, in its judgment in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-175), it concluded that the complete denial of the right of Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to respect for their homes in northern Cyprus since 1974 constituted a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\u201c172. The Court observes that the official policy of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities to deny the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes is reinforced by the very tight restrictions operated by the same authorities on visits to the north by Greek Cypriots living in the south. Accordingly, not only are displaced persons unable to apply to the authorities to reoccupy the homes which they left behind, they are physically prevented from even visiting them.\n173. The Court further notes that the situation impugned by the applicant Government has obtained since the events of 1974 in northern Cyprus. It would appear that it has never been reflected in \u2018legislation\u2019 and is enforced as a matter of policy in furtherance of a bi-zonal arrangement designed, it is claimed, to minimise the risk of conflict which the intermingling of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities in the north might engender. That bi-zonal arrangement is being pursued within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary-General ...\n174. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the complete denial of the right of displaced persons to respect for their homes has no basis in law within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 173 above); secondly, the inter-communal talks cannot be invoked in order to legitimate a violation of the Convention; thirdly, ", "001-79346": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF WASSDAHL v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that the length of the administrative proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n23. The period to be taken into consideration began on 28 May 1996 and ended on 11 September 2003. It thus lasted over seven years and three months for one administrative and three judicial levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not awaited the final outcome of the national compensation proceedings against the Swedish State before introducing the complaint before the Court. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court, pronounced on 9 June 2005, where the plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, there was an effective remedy available to the applicant which he should have been obliged to exhaust before complaining to the Court. In any event, they claimed that he should now be required to await the final outcome of the national compensation proceedings before his application was dealt with by the Court.\n25. The Court first observes that the judgment of the Supreme Court referred to by the Government was pronounced on 9 June 2005, i.e. almost one year and seven months after the applicant lodged the present application with the Court. Thus, at the time of introduction of the present application to the Court, there were no indications that there existed an effective remedy in Sweden for complaints relating to the length of proceedings. The Court therefore considers that the applicant had exhausted the domestic remedies available to him at the time when he complained to the Court.\n26. However, since the applicant in any event instituted compensation proceedings against the State and these are still pending before the Supreme Court, the question arises whether the outcome of these proceedings should be awaited before the Court deals with the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n27. In this respect, the Court notes that the case referred to by the Government concerned criminal proceedings, where the complainant had been acquitted of the charges against him, whereas the present case relates to administrative proceedings, involving tax surcharges, for which there does not yet exist any guiding judgment from the Supreme Court. Moreover, both the District Court and the Court of Appeal rejected the complaint about the length of the proceedings before the administrative courts without giving any reasons, but simply stating that they did not find the proceedings to have been of excessive length. Here, the Court observes that the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment was adopted in November 2005, i.e. after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment referred to by the Government, but without making any reference to it. Lastly, the Court notes that the compensation proceedings have already been pending for more than a year before the Supreme Court, awaiting its decision on whether to grant leave to appeal.\n28. Having regard to the above, the Court considers that, for the purposes of the present case, the Government have not shown that the pending compensation proceedings in Sweden can be considered to be an effective remedy for the applicant, and it would thus be unreasonable to prolong the proceedings before the Court even further. It follows that the Government\u2019s objection must be dismissed.\n29. The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n30. The Government left", "001-61744": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HILL v.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2003 and on 6 April 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences and tariffs\n13. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. At the time of sentence, a \u201ctariff\u201d is imposed which represents the minimum period that the prisoner will have to serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. A life prisoner will not be released on licence until after the tariff period has been completed.\n#### B. Release on licence of mandatory life sentence prisoners\n14. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in Section 35(2):\n\u201cIf recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.\u201d\n15. On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on licence, the Secretary of State:\n\u201c...will consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.\u201d\n16. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (\u201cthe tariff\u201d) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner's risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see for example, R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 WLR135; R. v. Parole Board ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 AllER576).\n#### C. Recent developments\n17. Following the judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV), the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons on 17 October 2002 his decision to introduce interim measures applicable to the review and release of mandatory life sentence prisoners applicable to reviews from 1 January 2003. This allows for prisoners, whose tariff had expired, to apply for an oral hearing at which they may have representation, receive full disclosure of material relevant to the question of release and be able to examine and cross-examine witnesses.\n\u201cIf, at the end of the review process, the Parole Board favours the release of a mandatory life sentence prisoner once the minimum period has been served the Home Secretary will normally accept such a recommendation. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I.

The applicant complains about the review procedure applying to his continued detention, invoking Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention which provides:\n\u201c4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n19. The applicant submitted that since his tariff expired he has not had any proper review of his continued detention, as the Parole Board had no power to order his release and none of his reviews involved an oral hearing. His first oral hearing had been scheduled to take place in November 2003, ten years after the expiry of his tariff. As held in Benjamin and Wilson v. the United Kingdom (no. 28212/95, judgment of 26 September 2002), it was not sufficient either that the Secretary of State agreed to abide by the Parole Board recommendations.\n20. The Government submitted that, insofar as Stafford v. United Kingdom (cited above) was relevant to the applicant's complaints, he would enjoy the benefit of the interim arrangements announced by the Secretary of State on 17 October 2002. Further, this case could be distinguished from Stafford in which the Parole Board had recommended the applicant's release on life licence, whereas no such recommendation had been made in the present applicant's case.\n21. The Court recalls that in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (cited above) it found that the continued detention of a mandatory life prisoner sentenced for murder depended, after the expiry of the tariff which was the punishment element of the sentence, on elements of risk and dangerousness that could change with the course of time. Article 5 \u00a7 4 therefore required that he should be able periodically to challenge the continuing legality of his detention in an appropriate procedure.\n22. In this case, the applicant's tariff under his mandatory life sentence expired in or about 1993. While the Parole Board reviewe", "001-60735": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LUNDEVALL v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Lundevall v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr M. Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n20. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1987 and 1996, when the applicant made his applications to the Office, this corresponded to 6,868 and 10,317 Swedish kronor (SEK), respectively.\n#### B. Procedure\n21. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court. Appeals may be made against the Office\u2019s ordinary decision or a decision upon review under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act.\n22. The latter provision enables the Office to change a decision it has previously taken in order to rectify certain obvious defects of that decision, provided that it has not already been reviewed by a court. Thus, the Office must change its earlier decision if it contains a writing error, miscalculation or similar mistake or if it is incorrect due to it being based on obviously incorrect or incomplete information or an obviously incorrect application of the law or other similar reason. The question of changing a decision under section 10 a should, in principle, be raised within two years from the day the decision was taken. However, it may nevertheless be changed if it appears only after the elapse of this two-year period that it was based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or if there are other exceptional reasons. A decision is to be changed under this provision even if a request to that effect has not been made by the individual concerned.\n23. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n24. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n25. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal had constituted a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n27. The Government questioned whether the proceedings at issue had involved a determination of the applicant\u2019s civil rights and thus whether Article 6 was applicable in the case. They maintained that the proceedings before the Administrative Court of Appeal had concerned the issue of whether or not the applicant had been entitled to a review of the Office\u2019s original decision not to grant him disability benefits. They contended that that was mainly a procedural issue and noted, furthermore, that the appellate court had in fact not ruled on the merits of the case.\n28. Moreover, the Government claimed that it had been justified to dispense with an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case. They contended that a hearing would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they submitted that the issue to be examined by the Administrative Court of Appeal had mainly concerned points of law, as it had had to decide whether the Office\u2019s original decision had been based on obviously incorrect or incomplete material or there had been other exceptional reasons to change the decision by virtue of chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act. They also pointed out that the applicant had stated, as reasons for his request for a hearing, that the person in charge of the case at the Office be heard. This had been irrelevant, as that official could hardly have been expected to provide any other information than what was already apparent from the Office\u2019s decision and the documents in the case. Furthermore, all the relevant evidence in the case had been in writing. The judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s need of assistance or his expenses due to his handicap by meeting him in person but had had to rely on the written medical evidence submitted in the case. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing his case in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under a social-insurance scheme, no questions of public interest had been involved.\n29. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold an oral hearing and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing, he had, at least tacitly, waived his right to have his case heard in public before that judicial instance.\n##### 2. The applicant\n30. The applicant maintained that the examination by the Administrative Court of Appeal under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act had necessarily comprised an assessment of the facts of the case and had thus involved a determination of his \u201ccivil rights\u201d. Article 6 was thus applicable.\n31. Moreover, the applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. He stated that the case had not mainly concerned points of law; rather, the assessment under chapter 20, section 10 a implied that the appellate court examine on the merits the new circumstances that had been invoked in the case. He claimed that the case could not have been decided only on the available medical certificates but had required also an assessment of the applicant\u2019s personal situation. It had therefore been indispensable to hold a hearing at which the applicant would have had an opportunity to complete the case file by giving an account of his medical situation and its effects on his everyday life, including his extra expenses and need of assistance. Also, the County Administrative Court had given judgment in his favour and the Administrative Court of Appeal had been divided in rejecting his case. Thus, the case had been of a borderline nature which had further emphasised the need for an oral hearing. The new procedural situation in the appellate court \u2013 with the Board acting as opposing party \u2013 had also called for a hearing.\n32. The applicant also found it remarkable that the appellate court had considered a hearing to be unnecessary without giving any further reasons. He therefore could not assess whether the decisions had been in compliance with the 1971 Act.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n33. The Court observes that the proceedings at issue concerned the applicant\u2019s claim to benefits under a social-security scheme. They determined the preliminary question whether the Office\u2019s decision of 24 April 1987 had been based on obviously incomplete material and thus whether there was a basis under chapter 20, section 10 a of the 1962 Act to review that decision. It is true that the Administrative Court of Appeal, in finding that there was no such basis, did not formally examine the merits of the case. However, the preliminary question and the merits were indissociable in that an examination of the former necessarily involved an assessment of the merits. As is shown by the opinion of the dissenting judges in the appellate court and the judgment of the County Administrative Court, the conclusion that there was a basis to review the Office\u2019s original decision to refuse the applicant disability benefits necessarily led to a reversal of that decision and a finding that the applicant was entitled to the benefits in question. The Court further notes that, in appealing against the first instance judgment, the Board relied on the contention that it had not been shown that the applicant had a need of assistance or extra expenses which attained the level required under the 1962 Act and thus, in essence, argued on the merits of the applicant\u2019s claim. In the Court\u2019s opinion, these circumstances show that, in examining the Board\u2019s appeal and determining the preliminary question whether there was a basis for a review of the Office\u2019s original decision, the appellate court did not merely examine a procedural issue but in fact ass", "001-57899": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BONER v.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Presence of witness in court\n17. Under Scots law, a witness who has been present in court without the court\u2019s permission and without consent from the opposite party may still be allowed to give evidence provided that \u201cit appears to the court that the presence of the witness was not the result of culpable negligence or criminal intent, and that the witness had not been unduly instructed or influenced by what took place during his presence, or that injustice will not be done by his examination\u201c (section 140 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c).\n#### B. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n18. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n19. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the 1975 Act). No leave to appeal is required.\n20. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n21. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n22. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### C. Representation of appellants by counsel\n23. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### D. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n24. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n25. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n26. To extend legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n27. The Board takes its decisions on the basis of the documents before it, which normally include copies of the note of appeal, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the trial judge\u2019s report on the case. The views expressed by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and counsel will also be taken into account.\n28. Although the legislation does not provide for a formal review, the Board will, as a matter of practice, when requested to do so, reconsider an application which has been refused. Such reconsideration involves the application being referred to an external reporter, who was not involved in the Board\u2019s earlier decision and who reports to the Board on the merits of the application. Otherwise, Board decisions are subject to ordinary judicial review.\n29. If the appellant proceeds with his appeal without legal aid and the court considers that, prima facie, he may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds, the court must immediately adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the Board\u2019s decision be reviewed.\n30. The practice of the court in this regard was formalised following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Granger v. the United Kingdom of 28 March 1990 (Series A no. 174) by a Practice Note to this effect issued on 4 December 1990 by the Lord Justice General to all Appeal Court Chairmen and Clerks:\n\u201cIn any appeal where legal aid has been refused and the court considers that prima facie an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that the appellant should have legal representation in arguing his grounds, the court shall forthwith adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the decision to refuse legal aid should be reviewed.\u201c\n31. Where such a recommendation is made, legal aid is automatically granted. To this end, the Manual of Procedure of the Scottish Legal Aid Board provides in paragraph 6.12 that:\n\u201cIn these circumstances the Board will receive a letter from the High Court of Justiciary giving the details of the case where they are recommending a re-consideration of the decision to refuse. If we are asked to re-consider a decision in these circumstances, then the application should be granted automatically. The case need not be seen by a reporter or Board solicitor, but ought to be referred to the Assistant Manager for the appropriate action.\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n32. Mr Boner applied to the Commission on 4 April 1991. He relied on Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, complaining that he had been refused legal aid.\n33. The Commission declared the application (no. 18711/91) admissible on 9 December 1992. In its report of 4 May 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by seventeen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n34. At the hearing on 18 April 1993, the applicant invited the Court\n\u201cto find and declare that there has been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights in terms of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c), and that in the circumstances just satisfaction should be awarded in terms of Article 50 (art. 50) at such a sum as the Court deems appropriate\u201c.\nThe Government, for their part, requested the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 (art. 6).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) OF THE CONVENTION\n35. The applicant who had been sentenced to eight years\u2019 imprisonment complained that he had been refused legal aid for his appeal against conviction in breach of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n... \u201c\nThis contention was accepted by the Commission but disputed by the Government.\n36. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3-c) attaches two conditions to an accused\u2019s right to receive legal aid. The first, \u201clack of sufficient means to pay for legal assistance\u201c, is not in dispute in the present case. The only issue before the Court is therefore whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c required that the applicant be granted such assistance free.\n37. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the manner in which paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) is to be applied in relation to appellate or cassation courts depends upon the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (see, inter alia, the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, para. 56).\n38. The Scottish system of criminal appeals grants all persons a right to appeal. No special leave is required (see paragraph 19 above). The High Court of Justiciary, in its appellate function, has wide powers to dispose of appeals (see paragraph 22 above). The procedure is not limited to specific grounds; any alleged miscarriage of justice may be challenged (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, the proceedings always involve an oral hearing at which the Crown is represented (see paragraph 21 above).\nHowever, not all appellants who qualify on financial grounds obtain legal assistance. An independent body (the Scottish Legal Aid Board) decides on the basis of a file whether an applicant has substantial grounds for taking an appeal and whether it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation (see paragraphs 24-29 above).\n39. According to the applicant and the Commission, the interests of justice required that Mr Boner be granted legal assistance for the hearing of his appeal on 24 January 1991 before the High Court of Justiciary. They referred to the Granger case previously cited, where the Court had found a violation, and concluded that there were substantial similarities between Granger and the present case.\n40. The Government sought to distinguish the two cases. In their contention, the appeal court in Granger, after hearing the appellant\u2019s submissions, considered that there was a point of substance which requ", "001-89821": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF GENCER v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. According to Article 24 \u00a7 1 of Law no. 3083, persons who are convicted of the offences defined in the first Section of the second Part of the Criminal Code and in Articles 312 \u00a7 2, 536 and 537 of the Criminal Code cannot benefit from the distribution of land. Article 24 \u00a7 2 of the same Law provides that land shall be taken back, had the right holder been convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the first paragraph subsequent to the acquisition of land.\n17. Article 38 \u00a7 3 of the Regulations on the Application of Law no. 3083 provides that, in view of the particularities and security of a region and subsequent to obtaining the opinion of the security institutions, the Directorate General is authorised to make amendments in the right holders list prepared by the Commission.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n18. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies given that he had not requested the rectification of the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision and that he had not raised an objection to the Gaziantep Administrative Court\u2019s decision to dismiss his request for a stay of execution.\n19. As regards the first part of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected similar objections in previous cases (see, in particular, Da\u011ftekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 70516/01, \u00a7 22, 13 December 2007, and G\u00f6k and Others v. Turkey, nos. 71867/01, 71869/01, 73319/01 and 74858/01, \u00a7\u00a7 47- 48, 27 July 2006). It finds no particular circumstances, in the present application, which would require it to depart from that conclusion. Consequently, it rejects this part of the Government\u2019s objection.\n20. As regards the second limb of the Government\u2019s objection, the Court recalls that, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, it may only deal with an issue after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. Nevertheless, the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies only requires that an applicant make normal use of remedies which are effective, sufficient and accessible in respect of his or her Convention grievances.\n21. In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s complaint related to the alleged unjust termination of his lease. In this respect, the applicant brought an action in the administrative courts to obtain the annulment of the Directorate General\u2019s decision dated 11 May 2000 and, meanwhile, sought interim measures to secure a stay of execution of that decision. However, the applicant\u2019s requests were dismissed by the Gaziantep Administrative Court. In the Court\u2019s opinion, the fact the applicant did not object to the dismissal of his request for a stay of execution is not material; it is not the case that his claim was thereby rejected for failure to comply with a procedural requirement. Having regard to the fact that the applicant\u2019s case was examined by the domestic courts who delivered a final and binding decision on the matter, the Court concludes that he must be regarded as having exhausted domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and this part of the Government\u2019s objection cannot be upheld.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n##### 1. As regards the length of the proceedings\n22. The applicant alleged that the length of the domestic proceedings exceeded the reasonable time requirement, in breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n23. The Court notes that the proceedings in question commenced on 11 May 2000 and ended on 15 April 2002. They thus lasted for approximately two years at two levels of jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court concludes that, in the present case, the length of the proceedings cannot be regarded as exceeding the reasonable time requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n##### 2. As regards the fairness of the proceedings\n25. The applicant complained that the failure of the Directorate General to submit the documents pertaining to the annulment of his right holder status to the domestic courts violated his right to a fair hearing within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a) and (b) of the Convention.\n26. The Government contested the applicant\u2019s claim.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Act of 26 May 1981 No. 25), Chapter 18 on Criminal Investigation, contains the following provisions:\nArticle 226\n\u201cThe purpose of the investigation is to obtain the necessary information for deciding whether an indictment should be preferred, and to serve as preparation for the trial of the case. ...\nIf a specific person is under suspicion, the investigation shall seek to clarify both the evidence against him and the evidence in his favour.\nThe investigation shall be carried out as rapidly as possible and in such a way that no one is unnecessarily exposed to suspicion or inconvenience.\u201d\nArticle 249\n\u201cThe question of preferring an indictment shall be decided as soon as the case is sufficiently prepared for this purpose.\u201d\n17. In the proceedings before the Court, the Government drew attention to certain case-law of the Norwegian Supreme Court, according to which a 64-year-old man had been sentenced to 8 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and gross embezzlement totalling NOK 5 ,000,000 (Norsk Retstidende \u2013 \u201cRt\u201d1964, p. 773); a man without a previous criminal record had been sentenced to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment for economic crimes, including gross fraud, amounting to NOK 100,000,000 (Rt 1990, p. 641); a person had been sentenced to 4 years and 6 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 9,500,000 (Rt 1992, p. 106), and a person had been sentenced to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud amounting to NOK 1,200,000 with respect to over 20 victims (Rt 1992, p. 1016).\nThe applicant drew the Court\u2019s attention, inter alia, to Supreme Court rulings in which a lawyer\u2019s secretary had been sentenced to 1 year and 4 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross fraud and embezzlement with respect to NOK 1,100,000 (Rt 1995, p. 1962) and another decision where two men, aged 43 and 28, with previous criminal records, had been sentenced to 8 months\u2019 imprisonment for gross tax fraud amounting to NOK 1,500,000 (Rt 1995, p. 250).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complains that the criminal proceedings against him \u2013 which lasted from the end of January 1987 to 13 September 1994, thus over 7 years and 7 months \u2013 were not concluded within a reasonable time as required by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by a ... tribunal....\u201d\n#### A. Arguments before the Court\n##### 1. The applicant\n19. The applicant maintained that the case was not very complex, no more so than any other case of this nature, and that the delay in the proceedings was not attributable to his own conduct. Any delay caused by Mr D.R.\u2019s escape to Spain should not be counted against the applicant. In his opinion, it should have been possible for the police to interview Mr D.R. between 7 November 1990 and 8 July 1991, while he was detained in Spain. At all times during the investigations the applicant was available for inquiries by the police. Rather, as pointed out by the City Court, the delay was caused by the changes of police investigators in the case. However, this factor was only one of three mitigating circumstances taken into account. The sentence imposed was only a little lower than the average sentence for the kind of offences in question, which could be explained by the factors referred to by the City Court other than the length. Thus, as his sentence had not been sufficiently reduced, it could not be said that he had obtained adequate redress for the violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention occasioned by the excessive duration of the proceedings in his case.\n##### 2. The Government\n20. The Government point out that the maximum sentence with respect to the offences for which the applicant was convicted was 9 years\u2019 imprisonment and that, having regard to the seriousness of the proscribed conduct and the suffering inflicted on the aggrieved individuals, the trial court considered that the sentence had to be severe. Considering, inter alia, the length of the proceedings as a mitigating circumstance, the court fixed the sentence at no more than 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. It was clear from the court\u2019s reasoning that the length of the proceedings was a decisive factor in the leniency of the sentence. Thus the mitigation on grounds of length was measurable and could not be viewed as an unverifiable declaration of good intent. Given the level of sentences imposed in comparable cases, one could reasonably assume that in the applicant\u2019s case the mitigating circumstances represented a reduction in sentence of at least 2 years\u2019 imprisonment. At least one year\u2019s reduction was attributable to the length of the proceedings alone, the City Court having attached less importance to the other two mitigating factors. Thus, bearing in mind the aggravating circumstances in the case, the reduction in sentence must be deemed substantial. The applicant was thus afforded adequate redress by the competent national authorities and could not claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n21. In any event, the Government submit that no delay occurred in the proceedings which could justify a finding of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In particular, there were two factors beyond the control of the authorities which had contributed to the length of the proceedings:\nFirstly, one of the two leading figures in the criminal activity concerned and a key witness against the applicant, Mr D.R., had disappeared after the interviews in 1987 and was only arrested in Spain in November 1990 and extradited to Norway in February 1992. Since the charges against the defendants were based on the same facts, it was in the interests of", "001-91059": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u00c7\u0130MEN v.

The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had not been communicated to him, and that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer while in police custody. Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (c) of the Convention, in so far as relevant, read as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; ...\u201d\n#### A. The non-communication of the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation\n14. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant complained that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had not been communicated to him.\n15. The Government submitted that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor was not binding on the Court of Cassation, as it was free to decide on appeals regardless of the Prosecutor\u2019s opinion. They further maintained that the applicant\u2019s representative had had the right to consult the case file and examine the documents. Finally, the Government pointed out that, on account of the recent amendment of 27 March 2003, Article 316 of the Code of Criminal Procedure now provides that the written opinion of the Principal Public Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation must be sent to the parties.\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes in the first place that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n17. It further observes that it has already examined the same grievance in the case of G\u00f6\u00e7 and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 55-58). In that judgment, the Court held that, having regard to the nature of the principal public prosecutor\u2019s submissions and to the fact that the applicant had not been given an opportunity to make written observations in reply, there had been an infringement of the applicant\u2019s right to adversarial proceedings.\n18. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned G\u00f6c judgment.\n19. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n#### B. Access to a lawyer during police custody\n##### 1. Admissibility\n20. The Government maintained in the first place that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since at no stage of the domestic proceedings did he rely on the fact that he had been deprived of his right to legal assistance during police custody. In the alternative, they stated that this part of the application was introduced outside the six months time-limit, since the applicant\u2019s police custody had ended on 20 April 2000, whereas the application was introduced on 8 December 2001 with the Court.\n21. The Court notes that the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was in accordance with section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling under the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. Furthermore, the Court observes from the documents in the case file that, on 20 April 2000, the applicant\u2019s lawyer applied to the Public Prosecutor at the Izmir State Security Court for permission to see the applicant; however this request was rejected. Moreover, in his petition submitted to the Izmir State Security Court on 4 December 2000, the applicant\u2019s lawyer stated that the restriction on the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance had constitu", "001-110271": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BALOGUN v.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant legislation\n16. Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good.\n17. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision, inter alia, on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n18. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n19. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules provides:\n\u201c353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\nA fresh claim, if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of State, and if refused, gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits. If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim, their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim.\n#### B. Relevant case-law\n20. In J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a Sri Lankan national suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, who had made a suicide attempt upon learning that his claim for asylum had been refused, and who claimed that he would commit suicide if it appeared that he would be removed to Sri Lanka. Lord Justice Dyson, delivering the judgment of the court, held that the correct test as to whether there was a real risk in terms of Article 3 in a suicide case was, as in other Article 3 cases involving expulsion, whether there were strong grounds for believing that the person, if returned, would face a real risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n21. The Court of Appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test. It required firstly, that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity. Secondly, there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching Article 3. The court also found, thirdly, that because of the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of expulsion cases, the threshold for what would meet the threshold of Article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving State but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness. Fourthly, a risk of suicide could, in principle, form the basis of a successful claim under Article 3. Fifthly, an important factor in determining whether removal would breach Article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill-treatment in the receiving State, if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide, was objectively well-founded. A fear found not to be objectively well-founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of Article 3. Finally, the Court of Appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and/or receiving States had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide. The existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of Article 3 as a result of removal.\n22. The Court of Appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages, namely, in the United Kingdom, in transit, and in the receiving State. The threshold for Article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving State was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the United Kingdom. In the case of the particular appellant, the Court of Appeal found that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the United Kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities; that the Secretary of State would provide appropriately qualified escorts and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport; and that in light of the finding that the applicant\u2019s fears of return to Sri Lanka were not objectively well-founded, and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that State, the risk of suicide in Sri Lanka would not reach the very high threshold of Article 3.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3 of the Convention, which provides as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n24. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. According to the Government, the applicant could have argued that he was a suicide risk and raised Article 3 of the Convention in the context of his appeal against deportation, but did not do so, relying instead only upon Article 8. He could also have raised the fact of his risk of suicide in his application for judicial review but, again, did not do so. He also failed to renew his application for judicial review. The first time that the applicant claimed to be at risk of suicide was in his request to this Court for interim measures under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n26. The Government referred to their letter of 2 December 2009 to the Court, which outlined the special protective measures that had been put in place in the detention centre in respect of the applicant, once notice of his previous suicide attempt had been received. The Government stated that, on the one subsequent occasion when concerns had arisen whilst the applicant was detained, namely on 29 December 2009 when he had claimed to have taken an overdose of paracetamol, he had been assessed by a medical team and found not to be in danger. Apart from that incident, the applicant had not attempted suicide in detention or following his release. However, the Government would put in place precautionary measures should the applicant be detained again prior to deportation, and the contractor responsible for his removal would be made aware of the applicant\u2019s circumstances. Special measures would be taken, including a medical escort if necessary, to mitigate any risk of suicide during the removal process and the applicant would be accompanied until the point of arrival in Nigeria. There was sufficient psychiatric treatment available in Nigeria, should the applicant require it. The Government therefore submitted that, given that all reasonable steps had been and would be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of suicide, the applicant had not been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, and nor would his deportation amount to such treatment.\n##### 2. The applicant\n27. The applicant, on the other hand, contended that the risk of suicide had only arisen after his application to revoke the deportation order was refused, and that there had been no right of appeal against this decision. The applicant\u2019s first suicide attempt had taken place on 13 August 2009, which was the same day on which his application for judicial review had been lodged by his representatives. Although no mention of the applicant being at risk of suicide had been made in the judicial review application, he claimed that his representatives had raised this matter in letters to both the Secretary of State and the High Court dated 18 September 2009, but that the letter to the Secretary of State had received no response, and that the High Court, in refusing his judicial review application on 30 October 2009, had not addressed the matter either. As regards the applicant\u2019s failure to renew his application for judicial review, he submitted that he had been apprehended on 10 November 2009 and served with removal directions before he was able to renew the application.\n28. The applicant contended that the Government had been made aware of his attempted suicide on 13 August 2009. He also submitted that he made a further suicide attempt on 11 December 2009 or 29 December 2009 whilst detained in the immigration detention centre. He claimed that his deportation to Nigeria would breach Article 3.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. The Court notes the Government\u2019s preliminary objection and also recalls its finding in NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, \u00a7 90, 17 July 2008 that in expulsion cases judicial review is in principle an effective remedy which applicants should be required to exhaust before applying to this Court. However, the Court considers it unnecessary to rule on whether the present applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this complaint since, in any event, it considers the complaint to be manifestly ill-founded.\n30. It is well-established that expulsion by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned, if deported, faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In such a case, Article 3 implies an obligation not to deport the person in question to that country. Article 3 is absolute and it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, \u00a7\u00a7 125 and 138, ECHR 2008-...).\n31. The Court further recalls that it has reserved to itself sufficient flexibility to find a violation of Article 3 even where the treatment in question arises not from the intentional acts of public authorities or non-State actors in the receiving State, but from the applicant\u2019s own physical or mental health (see Bensaid v. the United Kingdom, no. 44599/98, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2001\u2011I). However, the Court reiterates that, according to its established case-law (see D. v. the United Kingdom, 2 May 1997, \u00a7 54, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011III), aliens who are subject to expulsion cannot in principle claim any right to remain in the territory of a Contracting State in order to continue to benefit from medical, social or other forms of assistance provided by that State, unless such exceptional circumstances pertain as to render the implementation of a decision to remove an alien incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. Finally, the Court recalls that in order to violate Article 3, treatment must attain a minimum level of severity. This applies regardless of whether the risk of harm emanates from deliberate acts of State authorities or third parties; from a naturally occurring illness (see N., cited above, \u00a7 29); or even from the applicant himself (see Kharsa v. Sweden, no. 28419/95, Commission\u2019s decision of 26 October 1995, Decisions and Reports (DR)). The Court recalls that in previous cases involving a risk of suicide, it has found not only that the high threshold for Article 3 applies to the same extent as it does in other types of cases, but that appropriate and adequate steps taken by the relevant authorities to mitigate a risk of suicide will weigh against a conclusion that the high threshold of Article 3 has been reached (see Nikovic v. Sweden, no. 28285/95, Commission decision of 7 December 1995, (DR)).\n32. The Court notes that it is the risk to the applicant at the time of the proceedings before the Court that is relevant for the purposes of determining whether his deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above). The Court must therefore examine the situation as it would be were the applicant to be deported at this point in time. In this regard, the Court observes that the Government have set out, in their letter to the Court of 2 December 2009, the precautionary measures that would be taken should the applicant be re-admitted to immigration detention and the deportation order against him enforced. The Government addressed the risk that might arise at three stages: i) when the applicant is notified of the decision to remove him to Nigeria; ii) during his actual removal; and iii) after he has arrived in Nigeria. The Court notes that this is the approach espoused by the Court of Appeal in J. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, cited above, and which the Court considers is entirely consistent with the requirements of Article 3.\n33. As to the first stage, the Government state that, if detained and if assessed as being at risk of suicide, the applicant would be put under constant watch and that trained staff, aware of the applicant\u2019s circumstances, would be on hand at the detention centre. As regards the second stage, the Government state that the contractor responsible for executing the applicant\u2019s removal from the United Kingdom to Nigeria would be informed of the risk of suicide, as well as the applicant\u2019s medical history and previous suicide attempts. Suitable escorts trained in suicide and self-harm awareness and prevention and, if necessary, medical escorts, would be provided for the applicant\u2019s flight. The applicant would be accompanied up until the point of arrival in Nigeria. As to the third stage, the Government point out that adequate psychiatric treatment would be available to the applicant, should he require it, in Nigeria. The Government refer in this regard to a fact-finding mission to Nigeria conducted jointly by the United Kingdom Border Agency and the Danish Immigration Service in 2008, the findings of which were, inter alia, that there was psychiatric treatment available throughout the country and that psychiatric hospitals were able to treat all illnesses, including depression and suicidal tendencies. Hospitals were apparently well-staffed and staff well-trained.\n34. The Court finds that, whatever concerns there may be as to the previous handling of the applicant\u2019s case by the Government, the Government are now fully aware of the risk posed by the applicant to himself and can be relied upon to take the steps outlined in paragraph 33. The Court emphasises the high threshold for Article 3, as described in N., cited above, and which applies with equal force in cases involving a risk of suicide as in other cases (see Kharsa, cited above). In the light of the precautions to be taken by the Government and the existence of adequate psychiatric care in Nigeria, should the applicant require it, the Court is unable to find that the applicant\u2019s deportation would result in a real and imminent risk of treatment of such a severity as to reach this threshold. It therefore follows that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 is manifestly ill-founded and thus inadmissible, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT\n35. In view of the above, it is appropriate to discontinue the application of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant further complained that his deportation would breach Article 8 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society...for the prevention of disorder or crime...or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\na) The applicant\n39. The applicant contended that he had been in the United Kingdom continuously since the age of three, with indefinite leave to remain from 2003 until the order for his deportation was signed. He was without home or person to return to in Nigeria. The applicant claimed to enjoy family life in the United Kingdom with his half-brother, with whom he had been living since his release from detention; his aunt, whom he claimed was like a mother to him; and his girlfriend, a British citizen with whom he had been in a relationship since 2005. He also claimed to enjoy private life in the United Kingdom, given his length of residence there, comprising, inter alia, his relationship with his girlfriend and other friendships; his previous studies and employment; and the fact that all of his links were with the United Kingdom rather than with Nigeria. In the light of the young age at which he entered the United Kingdom, his lack of ties to Nigeria and the strength of his ties to the United Kingdom, the applicant contended that his deportation would gravely interfere with both his private and family life.\n40. Furthermore, the applicant submitted that the nature and seriousness of his offending history were not sufficiently grave as to render this interference proportionate for the purposes of Article 8. He pointed in particular to the fact that all of his offences had been committed before his twenty-first birthday and that he had not offended since his release from prison. He had also tested negative for drugs whilst in prison and claimed no longer to be abusing drugs. As regards the risk he posed to the public in terms of future offending, he stated that the Government had not conducted any risk assessment to determine the level of risk of recidivism. However, the applicant claimed to have learnt his lesson and to be determined not to commit further criminal offences in future but to establish a law-abiding life for himself with his girlfriend and resume his studies.\nb) The Government\n41. The Government submitted that the applicant did not enjoy family life in the United Kingdom, being a single adult and not part of any family unit. The Government referred to the findings of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (see paragraph 10 above) with regard to the applicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend, namely that it was not sufficiently settled, serious or long-term to amount to family life.\n42. The Government accepted, on the other hand, that the applicant enjoyed private life in the United Kingdom and that his deportation would represent an interference with that private life. However, that interference would be justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8, being in accordance with law and taken in pursuit of the legitimate aims of protecting public safety, the prevention of crime, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Government also contended that the interference was proportionate given the nature and seriousness of the applicant\u2019s offences, which were, for the most part, drugs offences, which the Government considered to be particularly grave given the issues of public protection that they raised. The Government pointed in particular to the fact that the applicant\u2019s last offence had been of sufficient gravity to attract a sentence of three years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant had committed his offences when he was already an adult and his case could therefore be distinguished from that of the applicant in Maslov v. Austria [GC], no. 1638/03, 23 June 2008, whose offences by contrast could be characterised as \u201cjuvenile delinquency\u201d. The Government considered the young age at which the applicant had entered the United Kingdom and the fact that he had stronger ties with that country than with Nigeria to be relevant factors, but maintained that his deportation would have a relatively minor impact on the applicant given that he did not have family life in the United Kingdom and could re-establish private life in Nigeria. In this regard, the Government pointed to the applicant\u2019s good health, high intelligence and the fact that he had lived alone since the age of eighteen with little support. As such, and having regard to the importance of protecting the public from drugs-related crime, the Government were of the view that the applicant\u2019s deportation to Nigeria would represent a proportionate interference with his private life in terms of Article 8.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na) General principles\n43. The Court recalls that, as Article 8 protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual\u2019s social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants such as the applicant and the community in which th", "001-170347": "\ufeff\nGRAND CHAMBER\nCASE OF HUTCHINSON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts). At the hearing in the present case, the Government indicated that there were on that date 56 prisoners serving whole life sentences. No prisoner in this category has been released since the date of the Vinter judgment.\n#### A. The Human Rights Act 1998\n14. The Human Rights Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201cSection 2 - Interpretation of Convention rights.\n(1) A court or tribunal determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right must take into account any\u2014\n(a) judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion of the European Court of Human Rights,\n...\nSection 3 - Interpretation of legislation.\n(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\n...\nSection 6 - Acts of public authorities.\n(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if\u2014\n(a) as the result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of, or made under, primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions.\n(3) In this section \u201cpublic authority\u201d includes\u2014\n(a) a court or tribunal, and\n(b) any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature,\nbut does not include either House of Parliament or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament.\n...\nSection 7 - Proceedings.\n(1) A person who claims that a public authority has acted (or proposes to act) in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) may\u2014\n(a) bring proceedings against the authority under this Act in the appropriate court or tribunal, or\n(b) rely on the Convention right or rights concerned in any legal proceedings,\nbut only if he is (or would be) a victim of the unlawful act.\n...\nSection 8 - Judicial remedies.\n(1) In relation to any act (or proposed act) of a public authority which the court finds is (or would be) unlawful, it may grant such relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.\n...\u201d\n#### B. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997\n15. Section 30 of the Act provides, as relevant:\n\u201c(1) The Secretary of State may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds.\u201d\n#### C. Prison Service Order 4700\n16. The policy of the Secretary of State for Justice on the exercise of the power of release on compassionate grounds is set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued as Prison Service Order 4700. The criteria, as formulated in April 2010, provide as follows:\n\u201cthe prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stoke;\nand\nthe risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\nfurther imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\nthere are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\nearly release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family\u201d.\n#### D. Court of Appeal decision in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin\n17. A special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted to hear these appeals, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge. It gave its decision (\u201cMcLoughlin\u201d) on 18 February 2014, in light of the judgment of this Court in the Vinter case.\n18. The appellant Newell challenged as contrary to Article 3 of the Convention the whole life order imposed on him for a murder committed while he was already serving a life sentence for a previous murder. The McLoughlin case took the form of a reference by the Attorney General under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1986, who contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The trial judge had instead imposed a life sentence with a tariff of forty years for a murder committed by a man with previous convictions for murder and manslaughter.\n19. In its decision, the Court of Appeal traced the development of the whole life sentence and the review of such sentences. It stated at paragraph 7 (citations omitted):\n\u201ci) On 7 December 1994 the then Home Secretary announced a policy in relation to prisoners serving a whole life tariff (...).\n\u201cIn addition, I have decided that for those life sentence prisoners for whom it is decided that the requirements of retribution and deterrence can be satisfied only by their remaining in prison for the whole of their life, there will in future be an additional ministerial review when the prisoner has been in custody for 25 years. The purpose of this review will be solely to consider whether the whole life tariff should be converted to a tariff of a determinate period. The review will be confined to the considerations of retribution and deterrence. Where appropriate, further ministerial reviews will normally take place at five-yearly intervals thereafter. Existing prisoners who fall into this category and who have already served 25 years or more in custody will not be disadvantaged. Their cases will be reviewed by ministers as soon as is practicable and after any representations they may wish to make.\u201d\nii) That policy was modified by a different Home Secretary on 10 November 1997 (Hansard HC Deb 10 November 1997, vol 300, cols. 419-420: written answer):\n\u201cSo far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25-year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994.\u201d\niii) In a challenge by Myra Hindley to the whole life tariff imposed on her, Lord Bingham CJ held in the Divisional Court in R v Home Secretary ex p Hindley [...] that whereas the narrow policy set out in 1994 was unlawful, this had been corrected by the 1997 policy which permitted the taking into account of exceptional progress whilst in prison. In the appeal to the House of Lords counsel for the Home Secretary made clear that the Home Secretary was prepared to review any whole life tariff, even in the absence of exceptional circumstances (...) Lord Steyn, when approving the legality of the Home Secretary\u2019s 1997 policy, recorded the way in which the policy had been clarified (...):\n\u201c.... counsel for the Secretary of State submitted that the policy of imposing a whole life tariff merely involves the expression of the current view of the Secretary of State that the requirements of retribution and deterrence make it inappropriate ever to release such a prisoner. It does not rule out reconsideration. The Secretary of State envisages the possibility of release in the event of exceptional progress in prison; and, even in absence of such progress, the Secretary of State is prepared to reconsider any whole life tariff decision from time to time.\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal then set out the relevant criteria of the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), commenting that these were \u201chighly restrictive\u201d (paragraph 11 of the McLoughlin decision). It raised the question whether the statutory scheme was compatible with Article 3. In answering the question, it stated:\n\u201c(b) Does the regime which provides for reducibility have to be in place at the time the whole life order is imposed?\n19. The Grand Chamber made clear, as is self-evident, that there is no violation of Article 3 if a prisoner in fact spends the whole of his life in prison. One example is an offender who continues to be a risk for the whole of his or her life.\n20. However, the Grand Chamber considered that the justification for detention might shift during the course of a sentence; although just punishment at the outset, it might cease to be just after the passage of many years. It said at paragraphs 110 and 121 of its judgment that for a life sentence to be compatible with Article 3, there must therefore be both a prospect of release and a possibility of review. It added at paragraph 122:\n\u201cA whole life prisoner is entitled to know, at the outset of his sentence, what he must do to be considered for release and under what conditions, including when a review of his sentence will take place or may be sought. Consequently, where domestic law does not provide any mechanism or possibility for review of a whole life sentence, the incompatibility with Article 3 on this ground already arises at the moment of the imposition of the whole life sentence and not at a later stage of incarceration.\u201d\n21. It made it clear that this requirement was quite different from the task of the judge in setting the sentence when saying at paragraph 124:\n\u201cHowever, the need for independent judges to determine whether a whole life order may be imposed is quite separate from the need for such whole life orders to be reviewed at a later stage so as to ensure that they remain justified on legitimate penological grounds. Furthermore, given that the stated intention of the legislative amendment was to remove the executive entirely from the decision-making process concerning life sentences, it would have been more consistent to provide that, henceforth, the twenty-five year review, instead of being eliminated completely, would be conducted within a wholly judicial framework rather than, as before, by the executive subject to judicial control.\u201d\n22. Thus whilst it is clear that the Grand Chamber accepted that a judge can impose a whole life order as just punishment, it concluded that a legal regime for a review during the sentence must be in place at the time the sentence is passed.\n23. Whilst we have accepted the submission on behalf of the Attorney General that the Strasbourg Court did not determine that the imposition of a whole life tariff itself violates Article 3, we return briefly to the arguments advanced contingently on the hypothesis that it did. In our judgment section 3 of the Human Rights Act could not be used to read down the legislation to preclude the imposition of whole life tariffs. That is because section 269(4) provides that if the court is of the opinion that no order for early release should be made because of the seriousness of the offence alone or in combination with others, it must order that those provisions do not apply. That being so, section 6(2) of the Human Rights Act disapplies the obligation on the court as a public authority to act compatibly with the Convention.\n24. The only remedy available in the domestic courts on this hypothesis would be a declaration of incompatibility, the discretionary remedy available under section 4 of the Human Rights Act when primary legislation is found to be incompatible with the Convention. Such a remedy is not available in the Crown Court and would not, in any event, affect the continuing operation of the statutory scheme.\n(c) Is the regime under section 30 a regime for reducibility which is in fact compliant with Article 3?\n25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of section 30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under section 30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u201cAt present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u201d\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of section 30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u201cThe fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his section 30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u201d\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that section 30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u201cAt the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under section 30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.\u201d\n29. We disagree. In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to \u201cpossible exceptional release of whole life prisoners\u201d. As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to exercise his power under section 30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.\n30. As we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that the policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence. It is important, therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is.\n31. First, the power of review under the section arises if there are exceptional circumstances. The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that although the whole life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances have since arisen. It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d is of itself sufficiently certain.\n32. Second, the Secretary of State must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds. The policy set out in the Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will be considered by the Secretary of State. The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds. He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the Lifer Manual. In the passages in Hindley to which we have referred at paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions of section 30 of the 1997 Act, require the Secretary of State to take into account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds.\n33. Third, the term \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d must be read, as the court made clear in R v Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3. They are not restricted to what is set out in the Lifer Manual. It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis.\n34. Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review.\n35. In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender \u201chope\u201d or the \u201cpossibility\u201d of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\n36. It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable. We find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life. But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases. The interpretation of section 30 we have set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of exceptional release.\nConclusion\n37. Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the CJA 2003 and in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 21. Although we were told by Mr Eadie QC that it might be many years before the applications might be made under section 30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer justifiable penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would not discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n20. The Court makes reference to the materials referred to in the Vinter judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 59-81). It refers in particular to one of the Council of Europe texts mentioned there, Recommendation Rec(2003)22 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on conditional release (parole). This provides, as relevant:\n\u201cDiscretionary release system\n16. The minimum period that prisoners have to serve to become eligible for conditional release should be fixed in accordance with the law.\n17. The relevant authorities should initiate the necessary procedure to enable a decision on conditional release to be taken as soon as the prisoner has served the minimum period.\n18. The criteria that prisoners have to fulfil in order to be conditionally released should be clear and explicit. They should also be realistic in the sense that they should take into account the prisoners\u2019 personalities and social and economic circumstances as well as the availability of resettlement programmes.\n...\n20. The criteria for granting conditional release should be applied so as to grant conditional release to all prisoners who are considered as meeting the minimum level of safeguards for becoming law-abiding citizens. It should be incumbent on the authorities to show that a prisoner has not fulfilled the criteria.\n21. If the decision-making authority decides not to grant conditional release it should set a date for reconsidering the question. In any case, prisoners should be able to reapply to the decision-making authority as soon as their situation has changed to their advantage in a substantial manner.\n...\n### VIII. Procedural safeguards\n32. Decisions on granting, postponing or revoking conditional release, as well as on imposing or modifying conditions and measures attached to it, should be taken by authorities established by law in accordance with procedures covered by the following safeguards:\na. convicted persons should have the right to be heard in person and to be assisted according to the law;\nb. the decision-making authority should give careful consideration to any elements, including statements, presented by convicted persons in support of their case;\nc. convicted persons should have adequate access to their file;\nd. decisions should state the underlying reasons and be notified in writing.\n33. Convicted persons should be able to make a complaint to a higher independent and impartial decision-making authority established by law against the substance of the decision as well as against non-respect of the procedural guarantees.\u201d\n21. The Court also refers to the 2006 European Prison Rules, in particular Rule 30.3 which provides:\n\u201cPrisoners shall be informed about any legal proceedings in which they are involved and, if they are sentenced, the time to be served and the possibilities of early release.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. The applicant complained that his whole life order violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. The Chamber judgment\n23. The Chamber noted that the Government initially considered themselves not to be in a position to submit observations on the merits of the case, as they recognised that the principles set out in the Vinter case were applicable. The Government changed their stance following the McLoughlin decision, arguing that a whole life sentence was now to be regarded as reducible. The Chamber examined the McLoughlin decision and recalled that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic law. It further observed that it was a well\u2011entrenched and necessary part of the legal tradition of the United Kingdom to develop the law through judicial interpretation. As the Court of Appeal had specifically addressed the doubts raised in Vinter regarding the clarity of the applicable domestic law, and set out an unequivocal statement of the legal position, that interpretation had to be accepted by the European Court. It concluded that the power of release under section 30 of the 1997 Act, exercised in the manner delineated in McLoughlin, was sufficient to comply with the requirements of Article 3.\n#### B. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n24. The Government agreed with the Chamber judgment. They maintained that the Court of Appeal had set out, authoritatively and conclusively, the operation of domestic law in clear and unequivocal terms. By virtue of sections 3 and 6 of the Human Rights Act, section 30 of the 1997 Act had to be interpreted and applied broadly enough so as to comply with Article 3 in every case. The Lifer Manual did not and could not restrict or in any way fetter this obligation. Therefore, as the Court of Appeal had stated, the fact that the text of the Manual had not been revised was of no legal consequence. The Manual remained valid inasmuch as it laid out the approach to be taken where release was sought on grounds of advanced terminal illness or severe incapacity. The McLoughlin decision had further clarified that the Secretary of State was obliged under domestic law to consider all relevant circumstances of each case in a manner compatible with Article 3 \u2013 there was no remaining unclarity as to the law in this regard. Section 30 operated in precisely the way that the Vinter judgment had held would be sufficient to satisfy with the requirements of Article 3.\n25. As for the basis for the Secretary of State\u2019s review of sentence, it was clear that the term used in section 30, \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, encompassed exceptional progress towards rehabilitation. The relevant yardstick in the Secretary of State\u2019s review would be that stated in Vinter, i.e. whether there had been any changes in the life of the prisoner and such progress towards rehabilitation that continued detention could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. A whole life prisoner therefore knew what he must do to have a prospect of release, and what criteria would apply to the review. No greater specificity was required; it was neither necessary nor practicable to seek to lay down in greater detail what a prisoner must be able to demonstrate to be considered for release or reduction of sentence. The European Court itself had not identified specific criteria in its Article 3 case law, but expressed itself in more general terms. In every individual case, therefore, all the relevant circumstances of the prisoner would be taken into account. This permitted the necessary flexibility in the review, adapting it to each set of individual circumstances.\n26. The domestic law was both accessible and foreseeable for prisoners. It was enough that they sought legal advice, which was available to them, or asked the prison administration, and they would receive an explanation of the applicable legal provisions. To every request the Secretary of State was required to give a reasoned response, which would be subject to judicial review. That review would not merely react to the decisions of the Secretary of State, but would bear on the merits of the case. The procedure had the capacity to develop the practical working out of the relevant considerations in this context, such as what amounted to a legitimate penological ground. Nor would successful judicial review merely mean the Secretary of State taking the decision again. It was within the power of the courts to directly order the release of a prisoner, if this was warranted.\n27. Regarding the timing of the review, the Government recalled that Vinter had regarded this matter as being within the margin of appreciation of the domestic authorities, which should not now be narrowed. That judgment did not prescribe a review after twenty-five years, but simply observed that the comparative and international materials reflected clear support for this particular arrangement. In any event, identifying such a timeframe was more relevant to a system which did not provide for a review for a very long period, which was not the case in the domestic system. Legal certainty did not require a specific time constraint on sentence review, when that review was premised on the ability of the prisoner to make a case that their detention was no longer justified. This they could do at any time; they were not obliged to wait an indeterminate number of years. That could be regarded as more advantageous to the prisoner than being required to serve a long, minimum term of years before being permitted to apply for review. Regarding the circumstances of the applicant, they noted that he had not suggested at any stage that there was no legitimate penological ground for his continued detention. There was nothing to stop him applying to the Secretary of State at any time in the future for a review of sentence.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant disagreed with the Chamber judgment, which he criticised as being inconsistent with Vinter, as well as with other cases decided by this Court since that judgment. He considered that the situation in domestic law remained contrary to Article 3, the McLoughlin decision having failed to remedy the deficiencies identified in Vinter. The Court of Appeal had proceeded on the incorrect assumption that the European Court was mistaken in its analysis of domestic law. Consequently, McLoughlin had merely sought to correct that perceived error, without developing the de jure situation. The review of whole life sentences was still based on a vague discretion vested in a Government minister. He considered that the Court should now rule that such a function must be entrusted to judges not politicians, this proposition finding clear support in the relevant international and comparative materials referred to in Vinter, and being implicit in the Vinter reasoning itself. He drew an analogy in this respect with the evolution that took place both in domestic case-law and Convention case-law requiring the removal of any role for the executive in the determination of sentences. Even if executive review could still be accepted in principle, the domestic system was deficient since the review was conducted by a partisan political figure, as illustrated by public remarks made by the then-Secretary of State following the McLoughlin decision. The procedure therefore did not offer any prospect of fairness, balance and certainty.\n29. The McLoughlin decision had indicated that the statutory terminology was to be given a broad meaning, but this should not be regarded as sufficient to meet the requirements of Article 3, as laid down in Vinter and subsequent judgments of this Court. The meaning of the terms \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d had not been elucidated. Greater specificity was required for the sake of legal certainty; without it, a prisoner\u2019s motivation to attempt rehabilitation would be completely undermined. The only detailed point of reference for whole life prisoners remained the Lifer Manual, the restrictive wording of which had been criticised in Vinter.\n30. Concerning the timing of the review, this issue was still affected by legal uncertainty. It was not stipulated in any legal provision, and had not been addressed in the McLoughlin decision. Whole life prisoners had no clarity as to when their sentences would be reviewed. The applicant recalled that prior to 2003, such sentences were systematically reviewed after twenty-five years, and that the proposal had been made in Parliament (a proposal put forward by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2013 and debated in the House of Lords in 2014) to reintroduce this practice via legislation. The Court\u2019s post-Vinter cases confirmed that a specific timeframe must be provided for in domestic law. Were the Court to now find no violation of Article 3, this would cause chaos in the relevant Convention case-law.\n31. Nor had the situation improved de facto since the Vinter judgment. The applicant criticised the Government\u2019s refusal to revise the Lifer Manual despite the criticism expressed by this Court and subsequently by the Court of Appeal. As a matter of fact, no whole life prisoner had ever been released in the way envisaged in Vinter. It could only discourage such prisoners from making the huge effort required to achieve rehabilitation to know that ultimately their fate would be decided by political decision, rather than an independent and impartial judge.\n32. The applicant further submitted that the system of sentence review should not be treated as falling within the margin of appreciation of the respondent State. This was, first, because of the absolute nature of Article 3. Further, to find a violation in the present case would not impose any particular solution on the United Kingdom. The domestic system had included a twenty-five year review in the past, which could easily be re\u2011introduced and entrusted to the Parole Board. This was not in any way complicated, as the legislative proposal made in Parliament showed. A violation would not mean that the whole life order as such was contrary to the Convention \u2013 the requirement was that it be reducible. Nor would it mean that the applicant should be released; this was a quite separate issue to be assessed elsewhere at another time.\n##### 3. The third party intervener\n33. The EPLN underlined the need for the law relating to the consideration of the release of whole life prisoners to be clear, foreseeable and accessible to those affected by it. Imposing an irreducible life sentence could no longer be regarded as a matter within the margin of appreciation of States, since Article 3 required reducibility. It was only regarding certain details of the requisite review that the State could claim a margin of appreciation, although it was ultimately for the Court to determine whether the review included the necessary procedural safeguards, having regard to the international consensus in this area and the great importance of what is at stake for the prisoner. Any margin available should be narrow.\n34. Referring to the relevant international instruments cited in the Vinter judgment, the EPLN argued that purely punitive or retributory sentencing is not compatible with human rights principles. Rehabilitation must be at the heart of sentencing, implying some prospect of release for life prisoners. For this to be a realistic prospect, there must be sentence planning, the opportunity to progress through the prison system, and structured reviews. The relevant international instruments identified certain basic procedural standards, demanding clarity and foreseeability as regards the timing of the review and the criteria governing it. These points had been endorsed in the Vinter judgment. In subsequent cases they had been reiterated and further developed. It was not just a question of rehabilitating the prisoner, but a matter of personal safety as well. A prisoner with no real prospect of ever being released risked the destruction of his personality, posing real danger to himself and to those in contact with him in the prison environment. To illustrate this point, a statement from a serving life prisoner was also submitted.\n35. The EPLN submitted that the Vinter judgment was not based on any misunderstanding of the domestic system, but had correctly revealed its shortcomings, i.e. the lack of a fixed timeframe and clear, published criteria. No steps had been taken domestically to develop the review into something more than mere compassionate release, already held to be insufficient. This stood in contrast to German constitutional law, cited in Vinter, which held that the preconditions for release and the procedures must be stipulated in law. The Court of Appeal had failed to identify and embed the essential procedural requirements of Article 3 in domestic law.\n36. The statutory duty on the Secretary of State to act compatibly with Article 3 was not sufficient, as it only concerned the point in time when the review took place. It had no bearing on the processes and procedures that must be in place prospectively. There were still no clear published criteria at the domestic level, nor any specific timeframe, contrary to foreseeability and legal certainty, and to the emerging international consensus. Nor were any procedural safeguards provided for, such as disclosure, the right to make oral representations at a review hearing, or the right to be given the reasons for a negative decision. It had not been shown that, notwithstanding these flaws, the system in fact operated in a Convention-compliant way.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n37. The parties\u2019 submissions were confined to the issue whether, in light of the McLoughlin ruling, the applicant\u2019s situation in relation to his whole life sentence is in keeping with the requirements of Article 3 as these were laid down in the Vinter judgment (Vinter and Others, cited above \u00a7\u00a7 123\u2011131). In this connection, the Court will examine, first, whether the unclarity in the domestic law has now been dispelled, and, if so, whether the relevant requirements are now met in the applicant\u2019s case. No separate examination will be made as to a possible violation of Article 3 in the period of the applicant\u2019s imprisonment prior to the McLoughlin ruling.\n##### 1. Whether the domestic law has been clarified\n38. In Vinter, the Court considered that section 30 of the 1997 Act could, by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above), be read as imposing a duty on the Secretary of State to release a whole life prisoner where it could be shown that continued detention was no longer compatible with Article 3, for example where it could no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. It noted that this was the reading given to section 30 by the Court of Appeal in the Bieber and Oakes cases, which would be consistent with the requirements of Article 3 as these were set down in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008. However, in addition to the relevant judicial dicta the Court also had regard to the published official policy and to the application of the law in practice to whole life prisoners. It found that the policy set out by the Secretary of State in the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above) was too restrictive to comply with the Kafkaris principles. It further pointed out that the Lifer Manual gave whole life prisoners only a partial picture of the conditions in which the power of release might be exercised. It concluded that the contrast between section 30, interpreted by the domestic courts in a Convention\u2011compliant manner, and the narrow terms of the Lifer Manual meant such a lack of clarity in the law that the whole life sentence could not be regarded as reducible for the purposes of Article 3.\n39. In the McLoughlin decision the Court of Appeal responded explicitly to the Vinter critique. It affirmed the statutory duty of the Secretary of State to exercise the power of release compatibly with Article 3 of the Convention. As for the published policy, which it too regarded as highly restrictive (at paragraphs 11 and 32 of McLoughlin, see paragraph 19 above), the Court of Appeal clarified that the Lifer Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release under section 30. Nor can the published policy fetter the Secretary of State\u2019s discretion by taking account only of the matters stipulated in the Lifer Manual. The failure to revise official policy so as to align it with the relevant statutory provisions and case law is, the Court of Appeal explained, of no consequence as a matter of domestic law.\n40. The Court considers that the Court of Appeal has brought clarity as to the content of the relevant domestic law, resolving the discrepancy identified in the Vinter judgment. Although Vinter contemplated that the policy might be replaced or quashed in the course of judicial review proceedings (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 129), the Court notes the Government\u2019s submission that the Lifer Manual retains its validity in relation to release on compassionate (in the narrow sense of humanitarian) grounds. What is important is that, as confirmed in McLoughlin, this is just one of the circumstances in which the release of a prisoner may, or indeed must, be ordered (see paragraphs 32-33 of McLoughlin at paragraph 19 above).\n41. Having satisfied itself that the applicable domestic law has been clarified, the Court will now pursue its analysis of it.\n##### 2. Whether the domestic law meets the requirements of Article 3\na. General principles established in the Court\u2019s case law on life sentences\n42. The relevant principles, and the conclusions to be drawn from them, are set out at length in the Vinter judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-122; recently summarised in Murray v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 10511/10, \u00a7\u00a7 99-100, ECHR 2016). The Convention does not prohibit the imposition of a life sentence on those convicted of especially serious crimes, such as murder. Yet to be compatible with Article 3 such a sentence must be reducible de jure and de facto, meaning that there must be both a prospect of release for the prisoner and a possibility of review. The basis of such review must extend to assessing whether there are legitimate penological grounds for the continuing incarceration of the prisoner. These grounds include punishment, deterrence, public protection and rehabilitation. The balance between them is not necessarily static and may shift in the course of a sentence, so that the primary justification for detention at the outset may not be so after a lengthy period of service of sentence. The importance of the ground of rehabilitation is underlined, since it is here that the emphasis of European penal policy now lies, as reflected in the practice of the Contracting States, in the relevant standards adopted by the Council of Europe, and in the relevant international materials (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 59-81).\n43. As recently stated by the Court, in the context of Article 8 of the Convention, \u201cemphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration has become a mandatory factor that the member States need to take into account in designing their penal policies\u201d (Khoroshenko v. Russia [GC], no. 41418/04, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2015; see also the cases referred to in Murray, cited above, \u00a7 102). Similar considerations apply under Article 3, given that respect for human dignity requires prison authorities to strive towards a life sentenced prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation (see Murray, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 103-104). It follows that the requisite review must take account of the progress that the prisoner has made towards rehabilitation, assessing whether such progress has been so significant that continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 113\u2011116). A review limited to compassionate grounds is therefore insufficient (ibid., \u00a7 127).\n44. The criteria and conditions laid down in domestic law that pertain to the review must have a sufficient degree of clarity and certainty, and also reflect the relevant case-law of the Court. Certainty in this area is not only a general requirement of the rule of law but also underpins the process of rehabilitation which risks being impeded if the procedure of sentence review and the prospects of release are unclear or uncertain. Therefore prisoners who receive a whole life sentence are entitled to know from the outset what they must do in order to be considered for release and under what conditions. This includes when a review of sentence will take place or may be sought (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122). In this respect the Court has noted clear support in the relevant comparative and international materials for a review taking place no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of sentence, with periodic reviews thereafter (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 68, 118, 119 and 120). It has however also indicated that this is an issue coming within the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States in the matters of criminal justice and sentencing (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 104, 105 and 120).\n45. As for the nature of the review, the Court has emphasised that it is not its task to prescribe whether it should be judicial or executive, having regard to the margin of appreciation that must be accorded to Contracting States (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 120). It is therefore for each State to determine whether the review of sentence is conducted by the executive or the judiciary.\nb. Application of these principles\ni. Nature of review\n46. In England and Wales the review of sentence is entrusted to the Secretary of State. The applicant submitted that this was wrong in principle, arguing that the review ought to be judicial in nature. He further argued that systems of presidential clemency should be distinguished from the domestic system on the ground that State Presidents can be regarded, by the nature of their office, as non-partisan figures who are above the political fray and thus less susceptible to the pressures of public opinion. Entrusting sentence review to a Government minister left little hope for fair, thorough and consistent assessment of the grounds for releasing a whole life prisoner.\n47. The Court observes that a judicial procedure brings with it a series of important guarantees: the independence and impartiality of the decider, procedural safeguards and protection against arbitrariness. In two cases, the Court found that due to the existence of a judicial procedure of sentence review the domestic law was in keeping with Article 3 of the Convention (see \u010ca\u010dko v. Slovakia, no. 49905/08, 22 July 2014, and Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, 13 November 2014).\n48. In the Bodein case, the Court discounted the power of presidential clemency (cited above, at \u00a7 59). Similar systems in Hungary and Bulgaria were likewise found not to meet the requisite standard: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar v. Hungary, no. 73593/10, 20 May 2014, and Harakchiev and Tolumov v. Bulgaria, nos. 15018/11 and 61199/12, ECHR 2014 (extracts) (referring to the system of presidential clemency in the period up to January 2012). However, it was because of various shortcomings in the procedures and not the executive nature of the review as such that the States in question were found to be in violation of Article 3. Moreover, in the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case the Court made some suggestions regarding the measures to be taken to execute the judgment but without suggesting that a judicial mechanism was required (at \u00a7 71 of that judgment; see in the same sense \u00d6calan v. Turkey (no. 2), nos. 24069/03, 197/04, 6201/06 and 10464/07, \u00a7 207, 18 March 2014).\n49. That an executive review can satisfy the requirements of Article 3 is shown by the Court\u2019s assessment of the systems in Cyprus and Bulgaria. Regarding the former, the power of the President of Cyprus, in light of the practice followed, was found to be sufficient (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 102\u2011103). Regarding the latter, the power vested in the President of Bulgaria was likewise found to be in compliance with Article 3, following reform in 2012 (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 257\u2011261). The Court notes here that the relevant European standard does not exclude executive review but refers to decisions on conditional release being taken by the \u201cauthorities established by law\u201d (paragraph 32 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22, see paragraph 20 above).\n50. It is therefore clear from the case-law that the executive nature of a review is not in itself contrary to the requirements of Article 3. The Court sees no reason to depart from this.\n51. As for the applicant\u2019s criticisms of the domestic system, the Court considers that these are countered by the effect of the Human Rights Act. As recalled in McLoughlin (see paragraph 29 of that decision, set out at paragraph 19 above), the Secretary of State is bound by section 6 of that Act to exercise the power of release in a manner compatible with Convention rights. He or she is required to have regard to the relevant case-law of this Court and to provide reasons for each decision. The power or, depending on the circumstances, the duty of the Secretary of State to release a prisoner on compassionate grounds cannot therefore be regarded as akin to the broad discretion conferred on the Head of State in certain other jurisdictions and found to be insufficient for the purposes of Article 3 in the cases referred to above.\n52. Furthermore, the Secretary of State\u2019s decisions on possible release are subject to review by the domestic courts, themselves bound by the same duty to act compatibly with Convention rights. The Court notes here the Government\u2019s statement that judicial review of a refusal by the Secretary of State to release a prisoner would not be confined to formal or procedural grounds, but would also involve an examination of the merits. Thus the High Court would have the power to directly order the release of the prisoner, if it considered this to be necessary in order to comply with Article 3 (see paragraph 26 above).\n53. Although the Court has not been provided with any examples of judicial review of a refusal by the Secretary of State to release a life prisoner, it is nonetheless satisfied that a significant judicial safeguard is now in place (see E. v. Norway, 29 August 1990, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 181\u2011A). The absence of any practice to date, which is unsurprising given the relatively brief period since the McLoughlin decision, does not necessarily count against the domestic system, just as it did not count against the Slovak and French systems, both found to be in conformity with Article 3 without reference to any judicial practice (see in particular \u00a7 60 of Bodein).\nii. Scope of review\n54. In the McLoughlin decision, the Court of Appeal took the view, as did this Court in Vinter, that the policy set down in the Lifer Manual was a highly restrictive one. It reiterated the position stated in Bieber that the Secretary of State must exercise his power of release in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3 of the Convention (see, respectively, paragraphs 32 and 29 of McLoughlin, set out at paragraph 19 above).\n55. In addition, and crucially, it specified, having regard to the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter, that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d referred to in section 30 cannot legally be limited to end-of-life situations as announced in the Lifer Manual (see paragraph 16 above), but must include all exceptional circumstances that are relevant to release on compassionate grounds. Although the Court of Appeal refrained from specifying further the meaning of the words \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in this context, or to elaborate criteria, it recalled earlier domestic case-law to the effect that exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in prison is to be taken into account (per Lord Bingham CJ in the 1998 judgment R v Home Secretary ex parte Hindley, and also Lord Steyn when that same case was decided by the House of Lords in 2001 \u2013 see paragraph 19 above). The Court further notes that in Bieber, when explaining the time at which an Article 3 challenge could be brought by a whole life prisoner, the Court of Appeal referred to \u201call the material circumstances, including the time that he has served and the progress made in prison\u201d (reproduced in Vinter and Others, cited above, at \u00a7 49). Having regard to all of these dicta, it is evidently part of the established law of England and Wales that exceptional progress towards rehabilitation comes within the meaning of the statutory language and is thus a ground for review.\n56. As for the other term used in section 30, \u201ccompassionate grounds\u201d, here too the narrow emphasis put upon it in the Lifer Manual has been corrected by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed that the term is not limited to humanitarian grounds but has a wide meaning, so as to be compatible with Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 33 of McLoughlin, set out at paragraph 19 above). In this respect too, the role of the Human Rights Act is of importance, section 3 of the Act requiring that legislation be interpreted and applied by all public bodies in a Convention\u2011compliant way.\n57. These clarifications are sufficient to satisfy the Court as to the existence of a review that not only can but also must consider whether, in light of significant change in a whole life prisoner and progress towards rehabilitation, continued detention can still be justified on legitimate penological grounds (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 125).\niii. Criteria and conditions for review\n58. The Court must next examine the criteria and conditions for review of whole life sentences. McLoughlin did not elaborate further on the meaning of \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, the Court of Appeal deeming it sufficiently certain in itself. The applicant was critical of this, arguing that it left him in a state of uncertainty. The Government considered that matters were sufficiently clear, no greater degree of specificity being possible or feasible. As the Court has already noted above, the term \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d encompasses the progress by the prisoner during the service of sentence (see paragraph 55 above). The relevant question is whether those serving life sentences in the domestic system can know what they must do to be considered for release, and under what conditions the review takes place (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122; see also paragraph 18 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22 and Rule 30.3 of the European Prison Rules, at paragraphs 20 and 21 above).\n59. Both parties referred to cases decided by Chambers of this Court after the Vinter ruling. These judgments are indeed relevant here, in that they illustrate the application by the Court of the Vinter case-law. In the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case, it was the lack of specific guidance as to the criteria and conditions for gathering the prisoner\u2019s \u201cpersonal particulars\u201d and for assessing them that was criticised. As there was no duty on the executive to give reasons for a decision, it meant that prisoners did not know what was required of them in order to be considered for release (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 57-58). Under Article 46, the Chamber called for a reform that would ensure the relevant review, and that life prisoners would know \u201cwith some degree of precision\u201d what they must do (at \u00a7 71). In the Harakchiev and Tolumov case, the Court faulted the system as it was pre-2012 for its opacity, for the lack of publicly-available policy statements, for the absence of reasons on individual requests for clemency, and also for the complete lack of formal and informal safeguards (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, \u00a7 262). In another case, Trabelsi v. Belgium, no. 140/10, ECHR 2014 (extracts), the Chamber based its finding of a violation of Article 3 on the absence of a sentence review mechanism operating on the basis of \u201cobjective, pre-established criteria of which the prisoner had precise cognisance at the time of imposition of the life sentence\u201d (\u00a7 137). The applicant relied on this statement in particular. The Court observes that while there is some variation in the formulations employed in these judgments, the essential point is the same in each of them, namely that there needs to be a degree of specificity or precision as to the criteria and conditions attaching to sentence review, in keeping with the general requirement of legal certainty.\n60. Consideration must equally be given to the post-Vinter cases in which the Court concluded that the domestic system was in conformity with the requirements of Article 3 as regards the reducibility of life sentences. There are three such judgments, and they demonstrate that a high degree of precision is not required in order to satisfy the Convention.\n61. The first is the Harakchiev and Tolumov case, in which the Court considered that as from 2012 there was adequate clarity surrounding the presidential power of clemency. Although, by its nature, the procedure was not subject to statutory criteria, the Constitutional Court derived guiding principles from constitutional values, namely \u201cequity, humanity, compassion, mercy, and the health and family situation of the convicted offender, and any positive changes in his or her personality\u201d (Harakchiev and Tolumov, cited above, see \u00a7 258). It is only the last of these that concerns progress by the prisoner. Although the procedure did not provide for the giving of reasons in individual cases, transparency was nonetheless ensured by other means. The Clemency Commission, created to advise on requests for clemency, functioned in accordance with published Rules of Procedure. These required it to take account of the relevant case-law of international courts on the interpretation and application of the relevant international human rights instruments. The rules also required the Clemency Commission to publish activity reports, which it did monthly and yearly, detailing its examination of requests for clemency, its advice to the Vice-President and the latter\u2019s decision on such requests (ibid., \u00a7\u00a7 90-107). The Court found that these measures increased the transparency of the clemency procedure and constituted an additional guarantee of the consistent and transparent exercise of the presidential power (ibid., \u00a7 259).\n62. In the \u010ca\u010dko case, the Court noted that the criteria for early release were that the prisoner \u201chas demonstrated improvement by fulfilling his or her obligations and by good behaviour\u201d and that \u201cit can be expected that the person concerned will behave in an appropriate manner in the future\u201d (\u010ca\u010dko, cited above, \u00a7 43). In the Bodein case, the Chamber noted that the review in French law was based on the dangerousness of the prisoner as well as any changes in his personality during the service of sentence (Bodein, cited above, \u00a7 60).\n63. The Court does not regard the domestic system as deficient in this particular respect for two closely-related reasons. First, the exercise of the section 30 power will, as is clear from McLoughlin and by virtue of the Human Rights Act, be guided by all of the relevant case-law of this Court as it stands at present and as it may be further developed or clarified in future. By setting out its relevant case-law in the preceding paragraphs, the Court\u2019s purpose is to aid the Secretary of State and the domestic courts to fulfil their statutory duty to act compatibly with the Convention in this area.\n64. The second reason is that, as the Court of Appeal stated and the Chamber accepted, it can be expected that the concrete meaning of the terms used in section 30 will continue to be further fleshed out in practice. The duty on the Secretary of State to give the reasons for each such decision, subject to judicial review, is of significance here, being a guarantee of the consistent and transparent exercise of the power of release.\n65. The Court sees fit to add, however, that a revision of the Lifer Manual (and other official sources of information) so as to reflect the law as it has been clarified by the Court of Appeal, and to reflect also the relevant Article 3 case-law, would be desirable so that the applicable law is readily accessible. The Court refers once again to the relevant standard defined by the Council of Europe (see paragraph 18 of Recommendation Rec(2003)22, at paragraph 20 above).\niv. Timeframe for review\n66. One particular aspect of legal certainty is the timeframe for sentence review, the Court having stated in Vinter that a prisoner should not be obliged to wait and serve an indeterminate number of years before being permitted to mount an Article 3 challenge (see paragraph 44 above).\n67. In general, providing for an automatic review of sentence after a specified minimum term represents an important safeguard for the prisoner against the risk of detention in violation of Article 3. The Court refers in this respect to the \u00d6calan (no. 2) case. It found there that domestic law clearly prohibited the applicant from applying at any point in his sentence of aggravated life imprisonment for release on legitimate penological grounds. The Turkish authorities were therefore required to establish a procedure to review whether the applicant\u2019s incarceration remained justified after a minimum term of detention (\u00d6calan (no. 2), cited above, \u00a7 204 and \u00a7 207). The domestic system in this case differs in that the process of review can be initiated by the prisoner at any time. The Court recalls that it took note of a similar arrangement in Cyprus, where life prisoners could benefit from the relevant provisions at any time without having to serve a minimum period of imprisonment (Kafkaris, cited above, \u00a7 103). It is possible to regard this as being in the interest of prisoners, since they are not required to wait for a set number of years for a first or subsequent review. In light of the very serious nature of the crimes committed by persons in this category though, it has to be expected that their period of detention will be lengthy.\n68. In two of the post-Vinter cases decided by this Court, the domestic system included a review of sentence after a set period \u2013 25 years in \u010ca\u010dko and 30 years in Bodein (effectively 26 years in that applicant\u2019s case). In the Harakchiev and Tolumov case though, the domestic system subsequent to the 2012 reforms did not include a fixed timeframe for review of sentence. Furthermore, the Court found a violation of Article 3 in the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Magyar case and gave indications under Article 46 as to the necessary measures without referring to the question of the timing of the review in either context.\n69. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court does not consider that the concern expressed in Vinter regarding indeterminacy, and the repercussions of this for a whole life prisoner (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 122) can be said to arise for the applicant at present. As is stated in section 30 of the 1997 Act, the Secretary of State may order release \u201cat any time\u201d. It follows, as the Government have confirmed, that it is open to the applicant to trigger, at any time, a review of his detention by the Secretary of State. It is not for the Court to speculate as to how efficiently such a system, which has minimum regulation, might generally operate in practice. It is the individual situation of the applicant that is the focus of these proceedings, and he has not suggested that he is prevented or deterred from applying to the Secretary of State at any time to be considered for release. Before concluding, though, the Court refers once again as it did in the Vinter case to the relevant comparative and international materials that show \u201cclear support for the institution of a dedicated mechanism guaranteeing a review no later than twenty-five years after the imposition of a life sentence, with further periodic reviews thereafter\u201d (Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7 120; see more recently and in the same sense Murray, cited above, \u00a7 99).\nv. Conclusion\n70. The Court considers that the McLoughlin decision has dispelled the lack of clarity identified in Vinter arising out of the discrepancy within the domestic system between the applicable law and the published official policy. In addition, the Court of Appeal has brought clarification as regards the scope and grounds of the review by the Secretary of State, the manner in which it should be conducted, as well as the duty of the Secretary of State to release a whole life prisoner where continued detention can no longer be justified on legitimate penological grounds. In this way, the domestic system, based on statute (the 1997 Act and the Human Rights Act), case\u2011law (of the domestic courts and this Court) and published official policy (the Lifer Manual) no longer displays the contrast that the Court identified in Vinter (cited above, \u00a7 130). Further specification of the circumstances in which a whole life prisoner may seek release, with reference to the legitimate penological grounds for detention, may come through domestic practice. The statutory obligation on national courts to take into account the Article 3 case-law as it may develop in future provides an additional important safeguard.\n71. As the Court has often stated, the primary responsibility for protecting the rights set out in the Convention lies with the domestic authorities (see for example O.H. v. Germany, no. 4646/08, \u00a7 118, 24 November 2011). It considers that the Court of Appeal drew the necessary conclusions from the Vinter judgment and, by clarifying domestic law, addressed the cause of the Convention violation (see also Kronfeldner v. Germany, no. 21906/09, \u00a7 59, 19 January 2012).\n72. The Court concludes that the whole life sentence can now be regarded as reducible, in keeping with Article 3 of the Convention.\n73.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that the length of the criminal proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n18. The Government contested that argument.\n19. The period to be taken into consideration began on 10 October 1990 and ended on 2 December 2003. It thus lasted approximately thirteen years and two months for two levels of jurisdiction, including military and ordinary first-instance courts.\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n21. As regards the merits, the Government maintained that the proceedings could not be considered to have been unreasonably long, particularly in view of the complexity of the case, the number of witnesses examined and the great number of offences with which the applicant was charged.\n22. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 46, ECHR 2000-VII; Szilv\u00e1ssy v. Hungary, no. 17623/04, \u00a7\u00a7 26-34, 1 April 2008). The Court particularly notes in the present case that the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court as many as four times. It reiterates that the repeated quashing and remittal of lower court decisions for re-examination are usually ordered as a result of errors committed by the latter, which, within one set of proceedings, discloses a deficiency in the operation of the legal system (see Wierciszewska v. Poland, no. 41431/98, \u00a7 46, 25 November 2003; Falimonov v. Russia, no. 11549/02, \u00a7 58, 25 March 2008).\n23.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained under Articles 3, 4, 5 and 13 of the Convention that the proceedings in his case had exceeded a reasonable time. He did not raise any specific complaints relating to the provisions relied on by him. However, the applicant made explicit reference to the 'reasonable time' requirement. For these reasons, the Court will examine the application under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n18. The Government contested the applicant's argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. The Court will therefore declare it admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The Government's submissions\n20. The Government were of the opinion that the applicant's case was a complex one. They submitted that the examination of that case had depended entirely on the outcome of the proceedings concerning the annulment of the applicant's conviction. The Government further pointed out that the case had related to facts that had taken place more than fifty years before its examination and the court had had to make an inquiry with the Office for the State Protection.\n21. They were of the opinion that the applicant's conduct had not contributed to the prolongation of the proceedings.\n22. The Government stated that the public authorities were partly responsible for the delay. They noted that a large number of claims similar to that of the applicant had been lodged with the Warsaw Regional Court and, although that fact should not exempt the Government from the obligation to ensure the speediness of proceedings, it should be nonetheless taken into consideration. The Government made reference to statistics, according to which the backlog of cases concerning compensation for wrongful convictions had been promptly tackled and the situation had been effectively remedied. Relying on the Court's judgment in the case of Trickovic v. Slovenia (no. 39914/98, 12 June 2001), they recalled that a Contracting State was exonerated from liability for a temporary backlog of court business if it took appropriate remedial action with the requisite promptness.\n23. The Government observed that the Regional Court had attempted to accelerate the submission of the requested documents by the Office for the State Protection.\n24. They were of the view that the examination of the applicant's case had not required special diligence, because after the annulment of his conviction he had received moral satisfaction and what had been at stake for him in the proceedings had been of a pecuniary nature solely.\n25. The Government stated that the proceedings had begun on 19 February 1993 and ended on 19 June 2000.\n##### 2. The applicant's submissions\n26. The applicant submitted that the proceedings had begun on 2 April 1992 and ended on 19 June 2000. He did not agree with the Government's contention that his case had been complex.\n##### 3. The Court's assessment\n27. The period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. However, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time (see, among other authorities, Humen v. Poland [GC], no. 26614/95, \u00a7 59, 15 October 1999, unreported).\nThe Court notes that the parties' submissions as to the starting date of the proceedings differ from each other. It observes that the applicant considered both procedures, the one concerning the annulment of his conviction and the one relating to compensation, as one. The Government regarded only the latter as relevant for the present application. Without prejudice to the issue as to whether the former procedure formed part of the proceedings concerning compensation, the Court notes that, in any event, there is n", "001-84289": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KO\u0141ODZI\u0143SKI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The relevant domestic law concerning the censorship of prisoners\u2019 correspondence is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 33-39, 4 May 2006.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that his detention was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n...\u201d\n15. The Court notes, however, that the applicant\u2019s detention was based on Article 258 \u00a7 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that he was detained on reasonable suspicion of having committed a serious offence (see paragraph 7 above). It accordingly finds that the decision to place the applicant in custody had a legal basis and was issued by the competent judicial authority. There is nothing to suggest that the legal basis for his detention was not clearly defined or, therefore, lacked the degree of foreseeability required by the Convention. The Court is therefore satisfied that the applicant\u2019s detention complied with the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 1. Moreover, the Court does not discern any appearance of arbitrariness in the decisions of the relevant judicial authorities on the applicant\u2019s detention. It also observes that the lawfulness of the detention was repeatedly reviewed by the competent domestic courts (see Malik v. Poland, no. 57447/00, \u00a7 26, 4 April 2006).\n16. Against that background, the Court concludes that the applicant\u2019s detention was \u201clawful\u201d within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention simultaneously.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about unfairness of the proceedings in that he had been convicted despite being innocent. However, according to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law ...\u201d\n19. The Court finds that the applicant did not file a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against the final judgment of the Gda\u0144sk Regional Court of 26 September 2006.\n20. In that regard, the Court observes that under Polish law and in accordance with the practice of the Supreme Court a cassation appeal can be brought by a party alleging a flagrant breach of any substantive or procedural provision of law capable of affecting the substance of the judgment (see, Kucharski v. Poland (dec.), no. 51521/99, 16 October 2003).\n21. The cassation appeal was therefore a remedy that would have permitted the applicant to submit the substance of the present complaint to the domestic authorities effectively and to seek relief.\n22. It follows that the complaint is inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The Court raised of its own motion an issue under Article 8 of the Convention on account of the fact that the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court had been censored. The relevant part of this provision reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s preliminary objection on exhaustion of domestic remedies\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all available domestic remedies. He had failed to bring an action under Article 24 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, in conjunction with Article 448 of the Civil Code. These provisions would have allowed him to assert that by censoring his correspondence the authorities had breached his personal rights protected by the Civil Code and to make a claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n25. The Government further submitted that the provisions of the Civil Code were reinforced by the provisions of the Polish Constitution, in particular Article 49 (which protects the freedom and secrecy of communication) and Article 77 (which secures to everyone the possibility of seeking redress for damage caused by a public authority).\n26. In this connection, the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006 in which a prisoner had been awarded PLN 5,000 in damages from the State Treasury for a breach of the confidentiality of his correspondence with the Central Board of the Prison Service and the Central Electoral Office. The Regional Court held that the confidentiality of correspondence was a personal right protected under Article 23 of the Civil Code whose breach could entitle the claimant to an award in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n27. The applicant did not comment.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n28. The Court notes that the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention concerning the alleged censorship of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was raised ex officio. The two letters at issue were sent by the applicant to the Court and he could not have been aware that they had been censored by the authorities. In these circumstances, the applicant cannot be required to bring any domestic proceedings in order to obtain redress for the alleged breach of his right to respect for his correspondence.\n29. Even had the applicant complained about the censorship of his letters to the Court, it has to be noted that the alleged interference with his correspondence occurred in 2004 and 2005, whereas the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006.\nAny relevance the latter judgment might have to the present case is therefore reduced by the fact that it was delivered after the relevant t", "001-93304": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASES OF WALTO\u015a and PAWLICZ v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicants complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 1 August 1997 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted for 11 years and 8 months for 2 levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government raised a preliminary objection that the applicants had not exhausted domestic remedies available to them under Polish law, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that the applicants had failed to appeal against the decision of 24 November 1998 to stay the proceedings.\n22. The Court considers that the Government\u2019s objection concerns a matter which goes to the issue of the applicants\u2019 conduct and their contribution, if any, to the length of the proceedings. It will accordingly address this issue at the merits stage. It further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible. Finally, the Court considers it appropriate to join the applications.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n24. The Court notes that the proceedings were stayed until the termination of other proceedings which were decisive for the outcome of the case (see paragraph 6 above). In so far as the Government argue that the applicants failed to appeal against the decision of 24 November 1998 to stay the proceedings (see paragraph 21 above), the Court considers that the State remains responsible also for delays in proceedings the outcome of which is necessary for the examination of another case.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n13. A detailed rendition of the provisions of the relevant domestic law is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Matyjek v. Poland, no. 38184/03, ECHR 2007\u2011...\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n14. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all relevant domestic remedies as required under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that neither at the appellate nor at the cassation stage had the applicant alleged, even in substance, any infringement of his right to a fair hearing as presented in his subsequent complaint to the Court. In particular, the applicant had not questioned the alleged restrictions on his access to the case file and on taking notes from it. Nor had he complained that he could not present his arguments in accordance with the principles of an adversarial hearing and equality of arms.\n15. The Government further argued that the applicant had failed to lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. Had the applicant been of the opinion that the legal provisions on which the courts had based their decisions or their interpretation \u2013 namely Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in conjunction with section 52 \u00a7 2 of the Lustration Act \u2013 had breached his rights, in particular his right to a fair hearing enshrined in Article 45 of the Constitution, he should have lodged a constitutional complaint. In particular, the applicant should have requested the Constitutional Court to examine whether the rules imposed by those provisions had violated his right to a fair trial.\n16. The Government further submitted that the application had been lodged outside the time-limit of six months as the final decision in the applicant\u2019s case had been given on 1 February 2007 while he had lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007.\n17. The applicant disagreed. He submitted that the rules governing access to the case file and the manner in which the lustration proceedings had been conducted could not have been effectively challenged in an appeal or cassation appeal as they were provided for by the domestic law. As regards the constitutional complaint, he submitted that it had been an extraordinary remedy which he had not been obliged to exhaust. Finally, he submitted that the decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007, and that he had lodged his application with the Court within less than six months from that date. The applicant provided a copy of an envelope from the Supreme Court, and a delivery receipt, confirming that the reasoned decision of the Supreme Court of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n18. The Court firstly observes that it has already found that Article 6 of the Convention under its criminal head applied to lustration proceedings (see, Matyjek v. Poland (dec.), no. 38184/03, ECHR 2006\u2011... and Bobek v. Poland (dec.), no. 68761/01, 24 October 2006).\n19. The Court also considers that the question of whether the applicant could effectively challenge the set of legal rules governing access to the case file and setting out the features of the lustration proceedings is linked to the Court\u2019s assessment of Poland\u2019s compliance with the requirements of a \u201cfair trial\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see Matyjek v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 42, Luboch v. Poland, no. 37469/05, \u00a7 46, 15 January 2008).\n20. The Court accordingly joins the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies to the merits of the case.\n21. The Court further notes that the Government alleged that the applicant had introduced his application out of time and that it should be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention. However, the Court observes that it appears from the documents provided by the applicant that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 1 February 2007 had been notified to him on 8 March 2007. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision, the object and purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention are best served by counting the six-month period as running from the date of service of the written judgment (see Worm v. Austria, \u00a7 33, 29 August 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). The applicant lodged his application with the Court on 3 August 2007 thus within less than six months from the date of notification. It could not be therefore said that the application was introduced out of time. The Government\u2019s objection should be dismissed.\n22. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that the lustration proceedings had been unfair. Article 6 of the Convention provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ...by [a] ... tribunal...\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\n(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.\u201d\n#### A. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n24. The applicant argued that the principle of equality of arms had not been respected in his case. He had been hindered in his access to the case file and thus could not defend himself properly against the allegations raised by the Commissioner of the Public Interest. Furthermore, he had been entirely deprived of a possibility to participate in the proceedings before the Commissioner and to access the case file prepared by him. He could not question the Commissioner\u2019s decision to choose the documents to be considered as evidence against him. He also complained about his lustration trial, in particular, about the rules governing the consultation of the case file in the secret registry. He referred to the case of Matyjek v. Poland and complained that he could not freely consult confidential documents and had been prevented from removing any notes he had made in the secret registry. The applicant submitted that he had been placed at a significant disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis the Commissioner who had had access to all documents and archives.\n25. The applicant considered misleading the Government\u2019s assessment that the evidence classified as secret had constituted only a minor part of his file. He submitted that some very important documents remained classified as secret and that he had a very limited access to them. These included the Militia\u2019s files which had constituted the main evidence against the applicant, receipts that he had accepted the money, the documents in which he had allegedly agreed to cooperate etc. Moreover, all the documents presented to the court by the Commissioner had been photocopies made from microfilms, which raised doubts as to their quality and genuineness. The applicant maintained that the classified evidence in his case covered documents produced by the former security services a long time ago which were no longer important for protecting the State\u2019s interest. Their confidentiality, however severely curtailed the applicant\u2019s rights of defence in the lustration proceedings. As a result, he could not challenge the version of events put forward by the Commissioner.\n#### B. The Government\u2019s submissions\n26. The Government argued that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair trial had been respected in the instant case. They submitted that part of the evidentiary material in the applicant\u2019s case had been classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d under the 1982 Protection of State Secrets Act. Afterwards, the State Security Bureau upheld the \u201csecret\u201d classification of those documents on the basis of the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act. The classified character of those documents had influenced the course of the proceedings; however it had had no adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. Moreover, most of the evidence collected in the case file and the reasoning of the court judgments had not been classified.\n27. The Government argued that under the 1999 Protection of Classified Information Act and Article 156 \u00a7 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the evidence in the case, having been regarded as classified information, had been available to the parties only in the secret registry of the lustration court. They maintained that both parties to the proceedings, that is, the applicant and the Commissioner of the Public Interest, had been subject to the same strict rules governing access to the file deposited in the secret registry, in particular those regarding the taking of notes. The notes from the case file had to be made in a special notebook which was subsequently placed in an envelope, sealed and deposited in the secret registry.\n28. Furthermore, the Government observed that the need to protect the public interest may justify withholding certain evidence from the defence in criminal proceedings (Edwards and Lewis v. the United Kingdom, nos. 39647/98 and 40461/98, \u00a7 53, 22 July 2003). However, they underlined that in the present case all evidence had been disclosed to the applicant. The only difficulty had been related to the classified nature of the evidence which had resulted in the application of particular arrangements as far as access to the case file had been concerned.\n29. The Government concluded that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n30. The Court firstly reiterates that the guarantees in paragraph 3 of Article 6 are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set forth in general in paragraph 1. For this reason it considers it appropriate to examine the applicant\u2019s complaint under the two provisions taken together (see Edwards v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 16 December 1992, Series A no. 247\u2011B, p. 34, \u00a7 33).\n31. According to the principle of equality of arms, as one of the features of the wider concept of a fair trial, each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis his opponent (see, for example, Jespers v. Belgium, no. 8403/78, Commission decision of 15 October 1980, Decisions and Reports (DR) 27, p. 61; Foucher v. France, judgment of 18 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011II, \u00a7 34; and Bulut v. Austria, judgment of 22 February 1996, Reports 1996\u2011II, p. 380-81, \u00a7 47). The Court further reiterates that in order to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial any difficulties caused to the defence by a limitation on its rights must be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see Doorson v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports 1996\u2011II, p. 471, \u00a7 72, and Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997\u2011III, p. 712, \u00a7 54).\n32. The Court had already dealt with the issue of lustration proceedings in the Turek v. Slovakia case (no. 57986/00, \u00a7 115, ECHR 2006\u2011... (extracts)) and in \u0100damsons v. Latvia (no. 3669/03, 24 June 2008). In the Turek case the Court held in particular that, unless the contrary is shown on the facts of a specific case, it cannot be assumed that there remains a continuing and actual public interest in imposing limitations on access to materials classified as confidential under former regimes. This is because lustration proceedings are, by their very nature, oriented towards the establishment of facts dating back to the communist era and are not directly linked to the current functions and operations of the security services. Lustration proceedings inevitably depend on the examination of documents relating to the operations of the former communist security agencies. If the party to whom the classified materials relate is denied access to all or most of the materials in question, his or her possibilities of contradicting the security agency\u2019s version of the facts will be severely curtailed.\nThose considerations remain relevant to the instant case despite some differences with the lustration proceedings in Poland (see Matyjek, cited above, \u00a7 56)\n33. Turning to the instant case, the Court observes firstly that the Government have pointed to the series of successive laws on the basis of which the communist-era security services\u2019 materials continued to be regarded as a State secret. Thus, at least part of the documents relating to the applicant\u2019s lustration case had been classified as \u201ctop secret\u201d. The Court has considered the powers vested in the Head of the State Security Bureau, in particular to uphold or lift the confidentiality rating, inconsistent with the fairness of lustration proceedings, inc", "001-89128": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LIDIA NOWAK v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n22. On 3 July 2008 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 15,000 (the equivalent of approx. EUR 4,600). The Government invited the Court to strike out the application in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n23. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. She maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n24. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n25. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof. The Court will have regard in this connection to the compatibility of the amount with its own awards in similar length of proceedings cases, bearing in mind the principles which it has developed for determining victim status and for assessing the amount of non-pecuniary compensation to be awarded where it has found a breach of the reasonable\u2011time requirement (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 85\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011...,; Scordino v. Italy (no.1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 193-215, ECHR-2006-...; and Dubjakova v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 10 October 2004).\n26. On the facts and for the reasons set out above, in particular the low amount of compensation proposed which is substantially less than the Court would award in similar case, the Court finds that the Government have failed to provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require it to continue its examination of the case (see, conversely, Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z o.o. WAZA v. Poland (striking out), no. 11602/02, 26 June 2007).\n27. This being so, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of its list of cases under Article 37 of the Convention and will accordingly pursue its examination of the admissibility and merits of the case.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n29. The Government refrained from taking a position on the merits of the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n30. The period to be taken into consideration began on 17 June 1994 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted over 14 years for one court instance.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Government acknowledged that the applicant had exhausted the remedies available under Polish law.\n32. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n34. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n35. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusi", "001-79069": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF JAGIE\u0141\u0141O v.

The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005\u2011V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005\u2011V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS.\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 28 February 1996 and ended on 29 April 2005. It thus lasted nine years and two months for two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s first preliminary objection\n21. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that he had not lodged a civil claim for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of the proceedings with the Polish civil courts under Article 417 of the Civil Court.\n22. The applicant generally contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n23. The Court notes that the applicant lodged a complaint about the length of the proceedings under the 2004 Act and the Warsaw Regional Curt confirmed on 16 November 2004 that the proceedings had been lengthy. The Court has already examined that remedy for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and found it effective in respect of complaints about the excessive length of judicial proceedings in Poland (see Michalak v. Poland (dec.) no. 24549/03, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43).\n24. Furthermore, the Court has already held that having exhausted the available remedy provided by the 2004 Act, the applicant was not required to embark on another attempt to obtain redress by bringing a civil action for compensation (see Cichla v. Poland no. 18036/03, \u00a7 26, 10 October 2006).\n25. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies. It follows that the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non\u2011exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n##### 2. The Government\u2019s second preliminary objection\n26. The Government submitted that the applicant could no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention as the Warsaw Regional Court in its decision of 16 November 2005 had acknowledged that the length of the proceedings in the present case had been excessive. The fact that the Regional Court had awarded no just satisfaction to the applicant could not affect the position, as the fees which he had paid when lodging the complaint had been returned to him.\n27. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n28. The Court recalls that an applicant\u2019s status as a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention depends, inter alia, on whether the redress afforded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he complains before the Court was adequate and sufficient having regard to Article 41 of the Convention.\n29. In the present case the Regional Court found a violation of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing without unjustified delay. However, it awarded him no just satisfaction. In these circumstances the Court is not satisfied that the redress obtained at domestic level was sufficient to deprive the applicant of the status of a victim for the purpose of Article 34 of the Convention. The Government\u2019s objection must therefore be dismissed (see Palgutova v. Slovakia, no. 9818/02, 17 May 2005 \u00a7 47-49).\n30. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n31. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities (see, among many other aut", "001-79713": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF G\u0118BURA v.

Mijovi\u0107,\nMr J. \u0160ikuta,\nMrs P. Hirvel\u00e4, judges,\nand Mr T.L. Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 13 February 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Relevant constitutional provisions\n13. Article 41 \u00a7 1 of the Polish Constitution provides as follows:\n\u201cInviolability and liberty of the person shall be afforded to everyone. Any deprivation or limitation of liberty may be imposed only in accordance with the principles and procedures laid down by statute.\u201d\n#### B. Conditional release of a person serving a prison sentence\n14. Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the 1997 Criminal Code reads as follows:\n\u201cThe court may conditionally release a person serving a prison sentence from serving the remainder of that sentence only when his/her behaviour, characteristics, personal circumstances and way of life prior to the commission of the offence, the circumstances in which the offence was committed and his/her behaviour following the commission of the offence and while serving a sentence, would justify a conclusion that, following [conditional] release, the person would abide by the law and, in particular, would not re-offend.\u201d\nArticle 78 \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 of the Criminal Code prescribes the minimum prison term, depending on the type of sentence and offender, which must be served before a convicted person may apply for conditional release. However, the decision to grant conditional release is left to the discretion of the court, which must be satisfied that the conditions laid down in Article 77 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code are met.\n#### C. Execution of a decision granting conditional release\n15. When conditional release is granted, a convicted person should be released on completion of the necessary administrative formalities as specified in the Ordinance (Zarz\u0105dzenie) of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 on Administrative Acts concerning Execution of Pre-Trial Detention and Sentences and Coercive Measures resulting in Deprivation of Liberty.\nParagraph 3 of that Ordinance states, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cAll administrative formalities shall be carried out without delay (niezw\u0142ocznie) ... This concern in particular (...) transmission of information and official notifications ... and releasing.\u201d\nParagraph 104.2 of the Ordinance provides that the convicted person should be released upon receipt of a copy of the enforceable decision granting him or her the conditional release. The release should be effected on the day of the receipt of the relevant documents by the prison (\u00a7 104.3 of the Ordinance).\nThe Ordinance does not prescribe any specific time-frame for the execution of the decisions granting conditional release.\n#### D. The State's liability for torts committed by its officials\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the State's liability for torts committed by its officials are set out in paragraphs 34-37 of the Court's judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, ECHR 2005\u2013V (extracts).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained about a delay of over 48 hours in his release from prison following the final decision granting him conditional release given by the Court of Appeal in the morning of 12 April 2000. He relied on Article 5 of the Convention, which reads, in its relevant part, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n...\u201d\n18. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The arguments of the parties\n20. The applicant submitted that on 12 April 2000 at 9 a.m. the Cracow Court of Appeal had upheld the Regional Court's decision granting him conditional release. The applicant argued that he should have been released on the same day, given that the distance between Cracow and Tarn\u00f3w was only about 100 km. Nevertheless, he had been released from prison only on 14 April 2000 at 4 p.m.\n21. The Government submitted that the Convention permitted deprivation of liberty only in those cases which were enumerated in Article 5 and only in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention provided for the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court. This category of permissible detention concerned any prisoner serving a sentence where \u201cthe lawful detention\u201d was based on \u201cconviction by a competent court\u201d. This normally referred to a prison sentence, although that was not specifically indicated in the text. The Government further observed that the execution of a prison sentence was, as a rule, dependent on a further decision which was not a matter for the courts but for the prosecution or prison authorities. The actual order to serve the sentence might not therefore emanate from a \u201ccompetent court\u201d but the detention would still be lawful under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a). This would be so even where a prisoner's conditional release was revoked for a breach of the conditions, entailing re-imprisonment for the remaining term.\n22. The Government submitted that in the present case the applicant had been serving a prison sentence in Tarn\u00f3w Mo\u015bcice Prison following three separate convictions. The overall term of his imprisonment was due to come to an end on 6 January 2002. Thus, the Government maintained that his detention had been lawful in that it was based on a conviction by a competent court.\n23. The Government further argued that the applicant had been released as soon as the decision on his conditional release had been served on the prison governor. Having regard to the foregoing, they maintained that his detention between 12 April 2000 and 14 April 2000 had been lawful under the Convention and in conformity with the applicable domestic law, in particular the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice of 27 August 1998 on Administrative Acts concerning Execution of Pre-Trial Detention and Sentences and Coercive Measures resulting in Deprivation of Liberty.\n24. Finally, the Government noted that the applicant could have lodged a compensation claim against the State Treasury under Article 417 of the Civil Code if he had considered that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty between 12 and 14 April 2000.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n25. The Court recalls that Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the fundamental right to liberty and security. That right is of primary importance in a \u201cdemocratic society\u201d within the meaning of the Convention (see De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium, judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 36, \u00a7 65, and Winterwerp v. the Netherlands, judgment of 24 October 1979, Series A no. 33, p. 16, \u00a7 37). Its key purpose is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2006\u2011...).\n26. All persons are entitled to the protection of that right, that is to say, not to be deprived, or to continue to be deprived, of their liberty (see Weeks v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, p. 22, \u00a7 40), save in accordance with the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of Article 5. The list of exceptions set out in Article 5 \u00a7 1 is an exhaustive one and only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-III, p. 848, \u00a7 42; Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2000-IV; and Assanidze v. Georgia [GC], no. 71503/01, \u00a7 170, ECHR 2004\u2011II).\n27. The Court reiterates that the expressions \u201clawful\u201d and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201d in Article 5 \u00a7 1 essentially refer back to national law and enshrine the obligation to conform to substantive and procedural rules thereof. Although it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law, under Article 5 \u00a7 1 failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention and the Court can and should review whether this law has been complied with (see, among many other authorities, Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996\u2011III, p. 753, \u00a7 41, and Assanidze v. Georgia, cited above, \u00a7 171).\n28. However, the \u201clawfulness\u201d of detention under domestic law is the primary but not always the decisive element. The Court must in addition be satisfied that detention during the period under consideration was compatible with the purpose of Article 5 \u00a7 1, which is to prevent persons from being deprived of their liberty in an arbitrary fashion. The Court must moreover ascertain whether domestic law itself is in conformity with the Convention, including the general principles expressed or implied therein (see, among many other authorities, Winterwerp, cited above, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 45, and Baranowski v.

On this last point, the Court stresses that where deprivation of liberty is concerned it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of \u201clawfulness\u201d set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person \u2013 if need be, with appropriate advice \u2013 to foresee, to a degree t", "001-61454": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF LEWIS v.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 July and 4 November 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Home Office Guidelines\n13. At the relevant time, the Home Office Guidelines of 1984 on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines were available in the library of the House of Commons and were disclosed by the Home Office on application.\n14. In each case, the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met: (a) the investigation concerned serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation had been tried and failed, or had been, from the nature of things, unlikely to succeed if tried; c) there must have been good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism and d) the use of equipment was operationally feasible.\n#### B. The Police Act 1997\n15. The 1997 Act provides a statutory basis for the authorisation of police surveillance operations involving interference with property or wireless telegraphy. The relevant sections relating to the authorisation of surveillance operations, including the procedures to be adopted in the authorisation process, entered into force on 22 February 1998.\n16. Since 25 September 2000, these controls have been augmented by Part II of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (\u201cRIPA\u201d). In particular, covert surveillance in a police cell is now governed by sections 26(3) and 48(1) of RIPA. RIPA also establishes a statutory Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with complaints about intrusive surveillance and the use of informants by the police.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n17.

Sweden\uf02a,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R.

Gotchev,\nand also of Mr M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 October 1993 and 21 February 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Penal Code\n18. Pursuant to Article 1 in Chapter 1 of the Penal Code (brottsbalken):\n\u201cA crime (brott) is constituted by any act for which the present code or other Law or Statute provides punishment (straff) as stated below.\u201c\nAccording to Article 3, a reaction to crime (p\u00e5f\u00f6ljd f\u00f6r brott) is understood in the code to mean the ordinary forms of punishment, notably fines and imprisonment.\n#### B. Offences against the good order of court proceedings\n19. Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, as applicable at the material time, read:\n\u201cA person who, at a court sitting, disturbs the proceedings or takes photographs in the courtroom, or fails to comply with directions or prohibitions imposed under Chapter 5, Article 9, shall be ordered to pay a fine. The same punishment (straff) may be imposed on a person who, in his oral or written observations to the court, expresses himself in an improper manner.\u201c\nChapter 5, Article 9, provides inter alia that the presiding judge may order a person who disturbs the proceedings or behaves in an improper manner to leave the courtroom.\n20. Fines imposed under Article 5 could not exceed 1,000 Swedish kronor (Article 9 in Chapter 9, as applicable at the relevant time), unlike ordinary criminal-law fines which were income-based.\n21. The question as to which court has jurisdiction in cases concerning offences against the good order of court proceedings (r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsf\u00f6rseelser) is governed by Article 5 in Chapter 19 - \u201cPart II. On the procedure in criminal cases\u201c (\u201cII. Om r\u00e4ttegangen i brottm\u00e5l\u201c) - of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Under this Article it is for the court sitting in the proceedings - whether civil, criminal or other - in which the improper conduct has occurred to examine of its own motion whether it constitutes such an offence.\nArticle 1 in Chapter 20 (Part II of the code) reads:\n\u201cThe court may not examine a question of criminal liability in the absence of a criminal charge. However, it may deal with issues of offences against the good order of court proceedings without a charge being brought.\u201c\nIn the proceedings under consideration, the courts followed the procedure laid down in the 1946 Act on the Handling of Court Matters (lagen om handl\u00e4ggning av domstols\u00e4renden 1946:807 - \u201cthe 1946 Act\u201c). Section 1 provides:\n\u201cThe present Act shall apply to matters relating to the administration of justice with which the ordinary lower courts must deal of their own motion or on application and which, according to statute or other regulation, do not fall to be examined under the procedure provided for in civil or criminal cases; however, it shall not apply to questions of punishment or other consequences of a criminal offence.\u201c\n22. If the court in question finds that a person has contravened Chapter 9, Article 5, it may immediately order him to pay a fine. Such a measure is not entered in the police register.\n#### C. Oral hearing in proceedings relating to offences against the good order of court proceedings\n23. Pursuant to paragraph 2 of section 4 of the 1946 Act, a hearing may be held if the court in question considers that the person concerned should be heard orally. Should the court decide to hold one, it is, pursuant to section 5 of the 1946 Act, governed by the same provisions as apply to hearings in civil cases.\n#### D. Conversion of fines\n24. A fine imposed under Chapter 9, Article 5, of the Code of Judicial Procedure may, subject to the conditions laid down in the 1979 Act on the Enforcement of Fines (b\u00f6tesverkst\u00e4llighetslagen 1979:189 - \u201cthe 1979 Act\u201c), as amended in 1983 (Lag 1983: 352), be converted into a prison sentence.\nAccording to sections 15 and 16 of the 1979 Act, the District Court must, upon the request of the public prosecutor, convert - by way of a decision (beslut) - uncollected fines into a term of imprisonment if it is obvious that the person concerned has intentionally failed to pay them or if there are other special reasons in the public interest for so converting them. A term of imprisonment imposed on this ground should be not less than fourteen days and not more than three months.\nIn proceedings concerning a request for the conversion of a fine into a prison sentence, the District Court must summon the prosecution and the defendant to appear at a hearing (section 17).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n25. In his application (no. 14220/88) to the Commission of 2 July 1988, Mr Ravnsborg complained, firstly, that in the proceedings relating to the fines he had, in breach of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, been refused an oral hearing and had not even had an opportunity to refute the charges against him. Secondly, he maintained that there was a further breach of this Article (art. 6) in that the Court of Appeal had refused to hold a public hearing before deciding on the issue of the appointment of an administrator. In addition, he alleged that the imposition of fines constituted a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (right to freedom of expression) of the Convention and of Article 1 (right of property) of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention. Finally, he invoked Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, maintaining that the measures were based on provisions which were invalid.\n26. On 10 October 1990 the Commission declared the second complaint inadmissible. On 9 January 1992 it found the first complaint admissible, but declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 10 December 1992 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by eleven votes to seven, that Article 6 (art. 6) being inapplicable, there had been no violation of this Article (art. 6). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. SCOPE OF THE CASE\n27. Before the Court, the applicant reiterated a number of allegations which the Commission had declared inadmissible in its decision of 9 January 1992. He argued that the latter decision was flawed on the ground that the independence and impartiality of one of the Commission members taking part in its adoption were open to doubt.\nHowever, the Court, in accordance with its established case-law (see, for instance, the Helmers v. Sweden judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p.13, para. 25), will deal only with the complaint declared admissible by the Commission, namely that the absence of an oral hearing in any of the proceedings relating to the fines violated Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.\nIn this connection it is not alleged that the applicant\u2019s \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201c were at issue. The only question is whether the proceedings related to a \u201ccriminal charge\u201c against him within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 (art. 6)\n28. Paragraph 1 of Article 6 (art. 6-1), in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\n29. According to the applicant fines constituted one of the basic forms of criminal punishment under Swedish law (see paragraph 18 above) and should - without exception - be administered in a manner fulfilling the requirements of Article 6 (art. 6).\nThe Government contested the applicability of this Article (art. 6) to the proceedings in issue; in their view, these were not \u201ccriminal\u201c but disciplinary in character. The Commission agreed.\nIn any event, the Government disputed that the absence of hearings gave rise to any breach of Article 6 (art. 6).\n30. In order to determine whether Article 6 (art. 6) was applicable under its \u201ccriminal\u201c head, the Court will have regard to the three alternati", "001-68512": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u015e\u0130R\u0130N v.

A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained in the first place that he had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court. The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicant was complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court, he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 15 October 1997.\n17. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six-month rule in the past and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003, and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n18. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n19. In the light of its established case law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court\n20. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts. Finally, they stated that the State Security Courts had been abolished as of 2004.\n21.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n12. The Government argued in the first place that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months time-limit. In their view, the six months period should start running from 9 October 2001, the date on which the applicant's police statement was taken. As regards the merits, the Government submitted that the applicant had been assisted by a lawyer during his questioning before the investigating judge on 12 October 2001 and thereafter during the subsequent criminal proceedings.\n13. The Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). In the present case, the applicant lodged his application with the Court within six months following the final decision of the Court of Cassation that had been delivered on 10 October 2003, in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Consequently, the Government's objection cannot be upheld.\n14. The Court further notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n15. The Court observes that the applicant's right of access to a lawyer was restricted during his police custody pursuant to Section 31 of Law no. 3842, as he was accused of committing an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, he did not have access to a lawyer during his interrogation by the police and the public prosecutor. Moreover, the Court observes that during his police interrogation, the applicant accepted the charges against him and this statement was subsequently used for his conviction by the trial court. The Court takes note of the fact that the applicant had legal representation during his questioning by the investigating judge. However, in the present case, the applicant was undoubtedly affected by the absence of a lawyer when his statement had been taken by the police as, although the applicant repeatedly denied his police statement, the State Security Court used this statement as the main evidence. The Court further finds it significant that the police statement of N.S., although retracted subsequently during the trial, was also used to confirm the applicant's police statement.\n16. In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that neither the assistance provided by a lawyer during the interrogation by the investigating judge, nor the adversarial nature of the subsequent criminal proceedings could cure the defects which occurred during the applicant's questioning by the police.\n17. The Court therefore concludes that, even though the applicant had the opportunity of being represented by a lawyer during his interrogation by the investigating judge, the absence of a lawyer during his police interrogation irretrievably affected his defence rights as his p", "001-68178": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF MILLER v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 18 January 2005,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Disability benefits\n12. According to Chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act (as in force until 1 January 2001, when the 1998 Act on Disability Benefits and Care Allowance - lagen (1998:703) om handikappers\u00e4ttning och v\u00e5rdbidrag \u2013 entered into force), a person who was ill or handicapped was entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she had been functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needed time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise had considerable extra expenses. The total need for support and assistance determined the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It was thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the guidelines of the National Social Insurance Board (Riksf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsverket; hereinafter \u201cthe Board\u201d) the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should attain at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1997 the basic amount was SEK 36,300. In 1983, when the applicant turned 65, it was SEK 19,400.\n13. According to Chapter 9, section 3 of the 1962 Act (as in force at the material time), such benefits were granted on a yearly basis at a level of 69%, 53% or 36% of the basic amount, depending on the extent to which the insured person was in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the disability.\n#### B. Procedure\n14. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act could form the subject of an appeal to the County Administrative Court, to the Administrative Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Administrative Court.\n15. The procedure in the administrative courts was governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings shall be in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would assist in the proceedings or be conductive to the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings and if it is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against holding a hearing (I kammarr\u00e4tt och l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt skall muntlig f\u00f6rhandling h\u00e5llas, om enskild som f\u00f6r talan i m\u00e5let beg\u00e4r det samt f\u00f6rhandlingen ej \u00e4r obeh\u00f6vlig och ej heller s\u00e4rskilda sk\u00e4l talar mot det)\u201d.\nUnder those circumstances it was not possible for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n16. From the case-law of the national courts, it appears that the grounds stated in the third paragraph of section 9 for refusing an oral hearing have been interpreted as being alternative rather than cumulative (see Regeringsr\u00e4ttens \u00c5rsbok 1997 ref 62).\n17. According to the preparatory work to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing could be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and could benefit the examination of a case, in particular in two situations: firstly, when it was necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it was difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case needed to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a supplement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\nIt was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party's request for an oral hearing should be given close consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing was necessary was to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. However, other circumstances could be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party's understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case was of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the value of what was at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing in his case, including the fact that he was denied an opportunity to have witnesses called to give evidence on his behalf, constituted a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Moreover, he complained under this provision that the competent courts had failed to carry out an examination of the merits of his Article 6 \u00a7 1 complaint. In so far as is relevant this provision reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government disputed the above complaints and invited the Court to declare them inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. In any event, they submitted, there had been no violation of the Convention in this case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. In so far as the applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court considers that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n21. In so far as the applicant alleges a further violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the alleged failure of the national courts to deal with his above complaint about the lack of an oral hearing, the Court notes that his allegation is not actually borne out by the facts. His claim that the County Administrative Court's refusal to hold an oral hearing had violated Article 6 \u00a7 1 was first entertained by the Administrative Court of Appeal, when refusing to hold a hearing and to grant him leave to appeal. Subsequently, the Supreme Administrative Court did consider the matter, as is evident from the information given to him on that occasion. This complaint must therefore be declared inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Merits of the complaint about the lack of an oral hearing\n##### 1. The applicant's submissions\n22. The applicant maintained that there were no exceptional reasons capable of justifying the refusal to grant him an oral hearing. His appeal against the Social Insurance Office's decision had raised both issues of fact and of law. These could not be determined solely on the basis of the medical records and opinions, since his claim for disability benefits was based not solely on his reduced functional capacity but also on his need for assistance and on the extra costs he had incurred. At an oral hearing the applicant would have been able to supplement the evidence by explaining his medical condition and its consequences in his daily life before he had reached the age of 65. Moreover, it would have enabled the national courts to put supplementary questions on these aspects to the applicant and to the witnesses he had requested be heard.\n##### 2. The Government's submissions\n23. The Government were of the view that there were exceptional circumstances in this particular case that justified dispensing with an oral hearing. As could be seen from the County Administrative Court's reasoning in its decision of 15 January 1998, it had decided the issue in accordance with domestic law, in the light of the subject-matter to be determined by it and having regard to all the written material that was already available in the case. The main issue to be determined was whether the applicant's need for assistance and additional costs had reached the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. However, one prominent feature was that the assessment as to whether the applicant was entitled to a disability allowance had to be made in relation to a particular point in time in the past, namely when he had retired at the age of 65. That was in 1983, 13 years before the matter was brought before the courts. This fact alone indicated that the relevant basis for the assessment was the written material from that time.\n24. Although one could infer from the applicant's request to the County Administrative Court for an oral hearing that he wished to have witnesses called, it should be noted that he did not give any particular reasons, nor indicate the subject of the witness evidence or what he sought to demonstrate.\n25. From the rather lengthy reasons that the County Administrative Court gave for its refusal to hold an oral hearing, it was evident that it regarded the written evidence on the applicant's condition at the relevant time as sufficient; there were no unclear points as far as the basis for the medical assessment was concerned. The applicant's claim and arguments were also clear. Any remaining uncertainties regarding his additional costs due to his impairment at the age of 65 could be clarified in writing. The principle established in the Court's case-law in the area of criminal proceedings that it was within the domain of the national courts to decide on the admissibility of evidence should also have a bearing in other areas.\n26. None of the oral evidence requested by him before the national courts would have provided any information of relevance to the case in addition to that already available in the written evidence, which included the Social Security Office's case-file.\nHearing the persons who had taken part in the Office's decision would not have supported his case.\nNor would it have served the applicant to have the physician appointed by the Office heard. It was not his task to make an independent assessment of the applicant's state of health at the relevant time. He had no personal knowledge of the applicant and had not been involved in the treatment of his medical condition. Instead, his role had been to act as a medical adviser to the Office and his opinion had been available in the case.\nOral evidence from the applicant's own doctor about his state of health 15 years earlier would have been of limited value. It was highly unlikely that the doctor would have been able to add anything to what he had already noted at the time in the medical records presented in the case. It was clear from the medical opinion issued by the doctor in 1996 for the purpose of the applicant's request for disability benefits that the assessment contained therein - that the applicant was in need of some support and had incurred additional costs - referred to the applicant's situation in 1996. That assessment was irrelevant to the issue whether the applicant would have qualified for disability benefits in 1983. It was hardly likely that the doctor would have been able to recall at an oral hearing the applicant's health status at a particular time in the past; he would have had to rely on the medical records that were already available to the County Administrative Court.\n27. There was no indication that the applicant offered to give evidence himself. Even if he had done so, it should be stressed that none of the judges taking part in the case had or were expected to possess any medical expertise of their own, let alone the ability to make an assessment of their own regarding the applicant's medical status 15 years' earlier by meeting him in person.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n28. It has not been argued, nor is there anything to suggest, that this case relating to the applicant's claim for benefits under the national social security scheme did not concern a dispute (contestation) over a \u201cright\u201d which could be said, on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. In particular, it could not be said that the applicant's claim was frivolous or vexatious or otherwise lacking in foundation (see Rolf Gustafsson v. Sweden, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, p. 1160, \u00a7 39 in fine). Nor is it disputed, and the Court is satisfied, that the right in question was \u201ccivil\u201d in character in the autonomous sense of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports, 1996-VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53). This provision is accordingly applicable; the only issue is whether there was a failure to comply with it on account of the refusal to hold an oral hearing in the case.\n29. The Court reiterates that in proceedings before a court of first and only instance the right to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 entails an entitlement to an \u201coral hearing\u201d unless there are exceptional circumstances that justify dispensing with such a hearing (see, for instance, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201311, \u00a7\u00a7 21\u201322; Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20\u201321, \u00a7 44; Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria, judgment of 23 April 1997, Reports 1997-II, pp. 679\u201380, \u00a7 51; Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2) Reports 1998-I, pp. 168-169, \u00a7 46; Salomonsson v. Sweden, no. 38978/97, \u00a7 34, 12 November 2002; Lundevall v. Sweden, no. 38629/97, \u00a7 34, 12 November 2002; and D\u00f6ry v. Sweden, no. 28394/95, 12 November 2002, \u00a7 37; G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, ECHR 2002-V, \u00a7\u00a7 47-52).\nThe exceptional character of the circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court, not to the frequency of such situations. It does not mean that refusing to hold an oral hearing may be justified only in rare cases. For example, the Court has recognised that disputes concerning benefits under social\u2011security schemes are generally rather technical, often involving numerous figures, and their outcome usually depends on the written opinions given by medical doctors. Many such disputes may accordingly be better dealt with in writing than in oral argument. Moreover, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities should have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy. Systematically holding hearings could be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in social-security cases (see the following judgments cited above: Schuler-Zgraggen pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58; Salomonsson, \u00a7 38; Lundevall, \u00a7 38; and D\u00f6ry, \u00a7 41).\n30. The Court further reiterates that, provided a public hearing has been held at first instance, a less strict standard applies to the appellate level, at which the absence of such a hearing may be justified by the special features of the proceedings at issue. Thus, leave-to-appeal proceedings and proceedings involving only questions of law, as opposed to questions of fact, may comply with the requirements of Article 6, although the appellant was not given an opportunity of being heard in person by the appeal or cassation court. Regard must be had to the nature of the national appeal system, to the scope of the appellate court's powers and to the manner in which the applicant's interests are actually presented and protected in the appeal, particularly in the light of the nature of the issues to be decided by it, and whether these raise any questions of fact or questions of law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file (see for instance Helmers v. Sweden, judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 16, \u00a7 36).\nThe Court considers that this less strict standard should also apply if an oral hearing has been waived at first instance and requested only on appeal. In the interests of the proper administration of justice, it is normally more expedient that a hearing be held at first instance rather than only before the appellate court (see the above-mentioned D\u00f6ry judgment).\n31. Turning to the particular circumstances of the present case, the Court observes from the outset that there can be no question of the applicant having waived any right to a hearing under Arti", "001-114240": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF REDFEARN v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Redfearn v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nLech Garlicki, President,\nDavid Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson,\nNicolas Bratza,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nGeorge Nicolaou,\nZdravka Kalaydjieva,\nVincent A. De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 October 2012,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. The Employment Rights Act 1996\n23. Under section 94(1) of the Employment Rights Act 1996, an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer. By section 98(1), an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section 98(2), which includes \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201csome other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held\u201d.\nSection 98(4) deals with fairness:\n\u201cWhere the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection (1), the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair (having regard to the reason shown by the employer) \u2013\n(a) depends on whether in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer\u2019s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee, and\n(b) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case.\u201d\n24. However, paragraph 106 provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) Section 94 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than one year ending with the effective date of termination.\u201d\n25. Section 108(3) of the Employment Rights Act provides a wide variety of exceptions from the one-year qualifying period, many of which derive from the United Kingdom\u2019s implementation of European Community legislation in the field of employment. These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave, refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998, or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer. Moreover, applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race, sex or religion are also exempt from the one-year qualifying period.\n#### B. The Race Relations Act 1976\n26. Section 1 (1) (1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 states the following:\n\u201cA person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-\n(a) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u201d\nSection 1 A of the Race Relations Act 1976 states:\n\u201c A person also discriminates against another if, in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection (IB), he applies to that other provision, criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other, but\n(a) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons;\n(b) which puts that other at that disadvantage, and\n(c) which he cannot show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 10 AND 11 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained of a violation of his rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. He submitted that, in choosing to become a member of the BNP and to stand for election, he was engaging both his right to freedom of expression pursuant to Article 10 of the Convention and his right to freedom of assembly and association pursuant to Article 11 and that his dismissal had disproportionately interfered with his exercise of those rights.\n28. Article 10 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n29. Article 11 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\n2. No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces, of the police or of the administration of the State.\u201d\n30. The Government contested these arguments.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n32. As the Court has noted, the applicant relies on both Article 10 and Article 11 of the Convention. However, the Court considers it more appropriate to examine his complaints under Article 11 of the Convention, but it will do so in the light of Article 10.\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The applicant\n33. The applicant submitted that for an employee to lose his job for exercising his right to freedom of association struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of that right. Consequently, he contended that the Government had a positive obligation under Article 11 of the Convention to enact legislation which would have afforded him protection from the termination of his employment by Serco on the ground of his involvement with the BNP. However, since he had less than one year\u2019s qualifying service, he was unable to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n34. The applicant submitted that fundamental rights must be effective and available from the first day of employment. While he understood that it might be appropriate to allow an employer a certain time in which to assess the conduct or capability of an employee, he argued that this should not apply in relation to discrimination on protected grounds. In fact, he submitted that freedom of association would be illusory if it could only be exercised after a certain period of service.\n35. The applicant further submitted that even if he had had more than one year\u2019s qualifying service, his employer would have been able to rely on his political involvement as being \u201csome other substantial reason\u201d to justify the termination of his employment.\n(b) The Government\n36. The Government contended that Article 11 did not impose any positive obligation to enact legislation of the kind suggested by the applicant. They submitted that in assessing the extent, if any, of the State\u2019s positive obligation, the Court should consider whether the nature of the interference struck at the \u201cvery substance\u201d of the right or freedom concerned (Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 44, S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7 54, ECHR 2006\u2011I). However, it did not necessarily follow from the fact that someone was dismissed from their employment as a consequence of manifesting certain political views that there would be an interference with their rights under Article 11 which struck at the very substance of the right so as to engage the State\u2019s positive obligation. In this regard the Government relied, by analogy, on Stedman v the United Kingdom, application no. 29107/95, decision of 9 April 1997, in which the Commission rejected as inadmissible a complaint under Article 9 of the Convention by a Christian applicant who had been dismissed because she refused to work on Sundays. The Commission noted that there had been no pressure on the applicant to change her religious views or to prevent her from manifesting her religion or beliefs. It followed that the Government could not be expected \u201cto have legislation that would protect employees against such dismissals by private employers\u201d.\n37. In the alternative, the Government contended that if a positive obligation existed, it was satisfied by the provisions of the 1996 Act. The Government submitted that in the United Kingdom, where the qualifying period of one year\u2019s service has been accrued, the 1996 Act would generally afford protection against dismissal on the grounds of political involvement, unless the employer could demonstrate that the involvement related to the capacity of the employee for performing the work in question or constituted \u201csome other substantial reason\u201d for the dismissal (see section 98(2) of the 1996 Act). If an employer was able to identify one of these two criteria, a fact-sensitive balancing exercise would have to be carried out. However, there was nothing to suggest that such a balancing exercise would be incompatible with the qualified rights under Article 11.\n38. Finally, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period which an employee must serve before statutory protection is obtained in relation to dismissal pursued a legitimate aim, namely the creation of greater employment opportunities by encouraging companies to recruit. Indeed, in the case of R v. Secretary of State for Employment ex parte Seymour-Smith and Another [2000] UKHL 12 the House of Lords held that it was reasonable of the Secretary of State to consider that the risks of unjustified involvement with tribunals in unfair dismissal cases and the cost of such involvement could deter employers from giving more people jobs. Consequently, the Government submitted that the one-year qualifying period could not be said to fall outside the State\u2019s margin of appreciation.\n(c) The Third Party Intervener: The Equality and Human Rights Commission\n39. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) submitted that even if the applicant had been employed in the public sector, his dismissal would have been justified as it was clear that a State could lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it was necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants (Van der Heijden v. the Netherlands, app. no. 11002/84, 8 March 1985 and Kern v. Germany, app. no. 26870/04, 29 May 2007). The question whether a dismissal would breach Article 11 turned on a number of factors, including the role of the employee, the degree of contact he or she had with the public and whether or not it involved public trust and confidence, whether the employee had direct contact with or provided services to individuals against which the relevant group or party had expressed hostility, the extent of his involvement with the party or group, the effect his continued employment would have on the employer\u2019s reputation, and the employee\u2019s conduct during the period of employment.\n40. In the Commission\u2019s view, a worker\u2019s active membership of a party such as the BNP, if it became public, would impact on the employer\u2019s provision of services regardless of whether or not there were any complaints about the manner in which he did his job. The fact that the applicant was in direct contact with services users, a significant proportion of whom were of an ethnic or religious group towards which the BNP had expressed hostility, would render any interference with his rights under Article 11 proportionate.\n41. Moreover, the Commission submitted that to require disabled Asian adults and Asian parents of disabled children to entrust themselves or their children to an elected BNP official in order to utilise public authority transport services would threaten to breach the rights of those service users. In this regard, the Commission noted that service providers were obliged to comply with the 1976 Act which prohibited race discrimination and racial harassment against employers and service users.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n42. Although the essential object of Article 11 is to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities with the exercise of the rights protected, the national authorities may in certain circumstances be obliged to intervene in the relationships between private individuals by taking reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association (see, mutatis mutandis, Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, 21 June 1988, \u00a7\u00a7 32\u201134, Series A no. 139, Gustafsson v. Sweden, 25 April 1996, \u00a7 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011II, and Fuentes Bobo v. Spain, no. 39293/98, \u00a7 38, 29 February 2000).\n43. Therefore, although the matters about which the applicant complained did not involve direct intervention or interference by the State, the United Kingdom\u2019s responsibility will be engaged if these matters resulted from a failure on its part to secure to the applicant under domestic law his right to freedom of association. In other words there is also a positive obligation on the authorities to provide protection against dismissal by private employers where the dismissal is motivated solely by the fact that an employee belongs to a particular political party (or at least to provide the means whereby there can be an independent evaluation of the proportionality of such a dismissal in the light of all the circumstances of a given case).\n44. The Court has recognised that in certain circumstances an employer may lawfully place restrictions on the freedom of association of employees where it is deemed necessary in a democratic society, for example to protect the rights of others or to maintain the political neutrality of civil servants (see, for example, Ahmed and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VI). In view of the nature of the BNP\u2019s policies (see paragraph 9, above), the Court recognises the difficult position that Serco may have found itself in when the applicant\u2019s candidature became public knowledge. In particular, it accepts that even in the absence of specific complaints from service users, the applicant\u2019s membership of the BNP could have impacted upon Serco\u2019s provision of services to Bradford City Council, especially as the majority of service users were vulnerable persons of Asian origin.\n45. However, regard must also be had to the fact that the applicant was a \u201cfirst-class employee\u201d (see paragraph 7, above) and, prior to his political affiliation becoming public knowledge, no complaints had been made against him by service users or by his colleagues. Nevertheless, once he was elected as a local councillor for the BNP and complaints were received from unions and employees, he was summarily dismissed without any apparent consideration being given to the possibility of transferring him to a non-customer facing role. In this regard, the Court considers that the case can readily be distinguished from that of Stedman v. the United Kingdom (cited above), in which the applicant was dismissed because she refused to work the hours required by the post. In particular, the Court is struck by the fact that these complaints, as summarised in paragraph 10, were in respect of prospective problems and not in respect of anything that the applicant had done or had failed to do in the actual exercise of his employment.\n46. Moreover, although the applicant was working in a non-skilled post which did not appear to have required significant training or experience (compare, for example, Vogt v. Germany, 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and Pay v. the United Kingdom, no. 32792/05, 16 September 2008), at the date of his dismissal he was fifty-six years old and it is therefore likely that he would have experienced considerable difficulty finding alternative employment.\n47. Consequently, the Court accepts that the consequences of his dismissal were serious and capable of striking at the very substance of his rights under Article 11 of the Convention (S\u00f8rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark [GC], nos. 52562/99 and 52620/99, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 62, ECHR 2006-I and Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 55). The Court must therefore determine whether in the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case a fair balance was struck between the competing interests involved, namely the applicant\u2019s Article 11 right and the risk, if any, that his continued employment posed for fellow employees and service users. It is also to be borne in mind that what the Court is called upon to do in this case is not to pass judgment on the policies or aims, obnoxious or otherwise, of the BNP at the relevant time (the BNP is, in any case, not a party to these proceedings), but solely to determine whether the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 11 were breached in the particular circumstances of the instant case. In this connection it is also worth bearing in mind that, like the Front National-Nationaal Front in F\u00e9ret v. Belgium (no. 15615/07, 16 July 2009) the BNP was not an illegal party under domestic law nor were its activities illegal (see, by way of contrast, Hizb Ut-Tahrir and Others v. Germany (dec.) no. 31098/08, 12 June 2012).\n48. The Court has accepted that Contracting States cannot guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right to freedom of association absolutely (Plattform \u201c\u00c4rzte f\u00fcr das Leben\u201d v. Austria, cited above, \u00a7 34). In the context of the positive obligation under Article 11, it has held that where sensitive social and political issues are involved in achieving a proper balance between the competing interests and", "001-72664": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF YASSAR HUSSAIN v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. Section 16(2)(b) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 provides that where\n\u201c... any person is tried on indictment and acquitted on any count in the indictment the Crown Court may make a defendant's costs order in favour of the accused\u201d.\n10. Practice Direction (Crime: Defence Costs) [1999] 1 WLR 1832, which was in force at the time of the applicant's trial, provided that:\n\u201cWhere a person is not tried for an offence for which he has been indicted or committed for trial or has been acquitted on any count in the indictment, the court may make a defendant's costs order. Such an order should normally be made whether or not an order for costs inter partes is made, unless there are positive reasons for not doing so, as where, for example, the defendant's own conduct has brought suspicion on himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him is stronger than it is.\u201d\n11. As noted above, no appeal lies to the Court of Appeal against a refusal of a defendant's costs order.\n12. By virtue of section 29(3) of the Supreme Court Act 1981, the High Court may not exercise its power of judicial review over the Crown Court in matters relating to \u201ctrial on indictment\u201d.\n13. An argument that the incorporation of the Convention into United Kingdom law required a remedy against a refusal of a defendant's costs order was rejected in R (Shields) v. Liverpool Crown Court [2001] EWHC Admin 90, in which Lord Justice Brooke stated that\n\u201c... unless and until Parliament decides to remove the anomaly, that an acquitted defendant has no right of appeal against the refusal of a defendant's costs order, however unjust the refusal may be, he has no Convention right of challenge to his decision in an English court and he is still bound to go to Strasbourg if he wishes to make the assertions he sought to raise unsuccessfully in the Administrative Court\u201d.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that the judge's comments on refusing a defendant's costs order were incompatible with Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court finds that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n17. The Government submitted that the observations made by the trial judge did not attribute guilt to the applicant either expressly or by clear implication, and that they did not amount in substance to a determination of guilt.\n18. The applicant contended that the judge's comments, at the very least, amounted to the voicing of suspicion in respect of the applicant after final acquittal. He added that one witness, who had stated that she had seen the applicant at least ten times, did not identify him in an identity parade, and that the only witness who did identify the applicant lacked credibility. He submitted that the prosecution should never have been brought.\n19. The Court reiterates that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 2 is one of the elements of a fair criminal trial required by Article 6 \u00a7 1. It will be violated if a statement of a public official concerning a person charged with a criminal offence reflects an opinion that he is guilty unless he has been proved so according to law. It suffices, even in the absence of any formal finding, that there is some reasoning to suggest that the official regards that person as guilty (see Daktaras v. Lithuania, no. 42095/98, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2000-X, and A.L. v. Germany, no. 72758/01, \u00a7 31, 28 April 2005). Whether a statement of a public official is in breach of the principle of the presumption of innocence must be determined in the context of the particular circumstances in which the impugned statement was made (see Daktaras, cited above, \u00a7 43). The provision applies even where the substantive criminal proceedings have ended, provided that there is a sufficient nexus between the criminal proceedings and the events in issue (see Sekanina v. Austria, 25 August 1993, \u00a7 22, Series A no. 266-A). In such circumstances, the question is whether the trial judge relied on suspicions as to the applicant's innocence after the applicant had been acquitted (ibid., \u00a7 30; see also Moody v. the United Kingdom, no. 22613/93, Commission's report of 16 October 1996, unpublished, and D.F. v. the United Kingdom, no. 22401/93, Commission decision of 24 October 1995, unreported, which both concerned Practice Directions on the making of defendants' costs orders).\n20. However, neither Article 6 \u00a7 2 nor any other provision of the Convention gives a person \u201ccharged with a criminal offence\u201d a right to compensation for lawful detention on remand where proceedings taken against him are discontinued (see, for example, Sekanina, cited above, \u00a7 25). Further, the Convention does not guarantee a defendant who has been acquitted the right to reimbursement of his costs (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 4", "001-83625": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF EVC\u0130MEN v.

The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gen\u00e7el v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant submitted that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Erzurum State Security Court which tried and convicted him. The applicant relied on Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Government submitted that the application should be declared inadmissible for failure to observe the six-month rule since the final domestic decision had been pronounced by the Court of Cassation on 18 November 1999, in the presence of the applicant's representative, while the application had been lodged on 10 May 2001; i.e. more that six months after the final domestic decision. They further noted that it had not been proven that the application had been lodged on 28 January 2000 because no document bearing the latter date had been communicated to them.\n20. The applicant disputed the Government's submissions and claimed that he had submitted his application to the Court in a letter dated 28 January 2000 within the prescribed time-limit.\n21. Having regard to the documents in its possession, the Court notes that the applicant filed his application in a letter dated 28 January 2000 where he set out the facts and complaints giving rise to the present application. Given that the applicant had learned about the final domestic decision on 18 November 1999, the Court observes that the application was lodged within the six months' time-limit. It therefore dismisses the Government's objection on the alleged failure to observe the six-month rule.\n22. Moreover, the Court considers this complaint not to be manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that, in the instant case, there was no basis on which to find that the ", "001-88836": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF K\u00d6KL\u00dc v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that his detention on remand exceeded the reasonable time requirement. He also contended that he had no effective remedy to challenge the lawfulness of his detention on remand. In respect of his complaints the applicant relied on Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 13 of the Convention. However, the Court considers that the applicant\u2019s second complaint should be examined from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4, rather than Article 13.\n17. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention provides as relevant:\nArticle 5 \u00a7 3\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\nArticle 5 \u00a7 4\n\u201cEveryone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n##### 1. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued that, as the applicant had lodged his complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on 17 February 2004, the time he had spent in detention between 10 March 1998 and 21 March 2001 should be rejected for having been introduced outside the six-month time-limit laid down in Article 35 \u00a7 1.\n19. The Court refers to the principles adopted in the Solmaz v. Turkey judgment (no. 27561/02, \u00a7 36, ECHR 2007\u2011... (extracts)), where it held that, if the applicant is in effect imprisoned throughout, the multiple, consecutive detention periods should be regarded as a whole and the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period. In the instant case, the applicant\u2019s detention on remand began when he was arrested on 10 March 1998. He was detained within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention until his conviction by the Istanbul State Security Court on 21 March 2001. As from that date, until 8 August 2001, when the Court of Cassation quashed the decision of the first-instance court, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) and, therefore, this part of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3. From 8 August 2001 until his release pending trial on 1 November 2004, the applicant was again in pre-trial detention falling under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. As a result, given the applicant\u2019s continued detention throughout these different phases, the six-month period should only start running from the end of the last period of pre-trial custody, which is 1 November 2004 (see Akyol v. Turkey, no. 23438/02, \u00a7 25, 20 September 2007).\n20. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.\n21. It further notes this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. Nor is it inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n22. The Court notes that, as explained above, the period in question began on 10 March 1998 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and ended on 1 November 2004, when the applicant was released pending trial. In line with its case-law, after deducting the time during which the applicant was detained as a convicted prisoner under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention between 21 March 2001 and 8 August 2001, the period to be taken into consideration under Article 5 \u00a7 3 in the instant case is over six years and four months. The domestic courts had constantly extended the applicant\u2019s detention on remand using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence and the state of evidence\u201d.\n23. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 19735/02, 10 May 2007; Solmaz, cited above; Dereci v. Turkey, no. 77845/01, 24 May 2005; Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, 2 February 2006).\n24. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n25. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.\n#### B. Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention\n##### 1. Admissibility\n26. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention for failure to exhaust domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1. Referring to the Court\u2019s decision in the cases of K\u00f6se v. Turkey ((dec.), no. 50177/99, 2 May 2006) and Ba\u015ft\u0131mar and Turkey ((dec.), no. 74337/01, 5 December 2006), the Government maintained that the applicant had failed to object to his continued remand in custody pursuant to Articles 297-304 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the Court finds that these cases cited by the Government may be clearly distinguished on their facts from the present application.\n27. The Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in cases similar to the present application (see Ko\u015fti v. Turkey, no. 74321/01, \u00a7\u00a7 18-24, 3 May 2007). It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence. Consequently, it rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n28. The Court considers this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Con", "001-57990": "\ufeff\nCOURT (GRAND CHAMBER)\nCASE OF BENHAM v.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 January 1996 and 24 May 1996,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Provisions concerning enforcement of payment of the community charge\n19. The relevant subordinate legislation is the Community Charge (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989/438) (\u201cthe Regulations\u201c).\nThe relevant provisions of Regulation 29 (\u201capplication for a liability order\u201c) are as follows:\n\u201c(1) If an amount which has fallen due ... is wholly or partly unpaid ... the charging authority may ... apply to a magistrates' court for an order against the person by whom it is payable.\n...\n(5) The court shall make the order if it is satisfied that the sum has become payable by the defendant and has not been paid.\u201c\nRegulation 39 (1) provides for the seizure and sale of a debtor's property (\u201clevying of distress\u201c):\n\u201cWhere a liability order has been made the authority which applied for the order may levy the appropriate amount by distress and sale of goods of the debtor against whom the order was made.\u201c\nRegulation 41 is concerned with the committal to prison of a debtor, and provides, so far as is relevant:\n\u201c(1) Where a charging authority has sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a magistrates' court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\n(2) On such application being made the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.\n(3) If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit -\n(a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or\n(b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of the warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.\n...\n(7) The order in the warrant shall be that the debtor be imprisoned for a time specified in the warrant which shall not exceed three months, unless the amount stated in the warrant is sooner paid ...\u201c\nThe relevant part of Regulation 42 provides:\n(3) Where an application under regulation 41 has been made but no warrant is issued or term of imprisonment fixed, the application may be renewed ... on the ground that the circumstances of the debtor have changed.\u201c\n20. In Regina v. Highbury Corner Magistrates, ex parte Watkins (9 October 1992, unreported) Mr Justice Henry said in the High Court that \u201cThe proceedings under Regulation 41 are plainly legal proceedings other than criminal proceedings. They are proceedings for the recovery of an unpaid tax.\u201c However, in Regina v. Hebburn Justices, ex parte Martin (31 July 1995, unreported), Mr Justice Sedley in the High Court held that although the initial obligation to pay community charge was a civil one, magistrates \u201cwho have reached the point of committal are entertaining a criminal process\u201c.\n#### B. Appeal from a decision of a magistrates' court by way of case stated\n21. By virtue of section 111 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 a party to proceedings before a magistrates' court may \u201cquestion the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by applying to the justices composing the court to state a case for the opinion of the High Court on the question of law or jurisdiction involved ...\u201c. This is known as the \u201ccase stated\u201c procedure.\n22. Under section 113 of the 1980 Act, magistrates may grant bail to a party who applies to them to state a case; but if they refuse to do so, in cases categorised as \u201ccivil\u201c under the domestic law, the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant bail until it is seized of some substantive proceedings to which the grant of bail can be ancillary.\n23. Acts performed pursuant to an order made by a magistrates' court which is subsequently set aside by a superior court are not themselves inherently unlawful. It is at the discretion of the higher court whether these collateral acts are also invalid: Regina v. Deputy Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex parte Hague [1992] 1 Appeal Cases 58, 124D-G (per Lord Justice Taylor in the Court of Appeal); London and Clydeside Estates Ltd v. Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 Weekly Law Reports 182, 189C-190C (per Lord Hailsham, Lord Chancellor, in the House of Lords); Regina v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin PLC [1987] Queen's Bench 815, 840A-C (per Sir John Donaldson, Master of the Rolls).\n#### C. The distinction between an act of a magistrates' court which is merely wrong in law and one which is so wrong as to be in excess of jurisdiction\n24. In English law, orders of a magistrates' court which are in excess of jurisdiction are void from the outset, whereas orders made within jurisdiction remain valid until set aside by a superior court. It is only in respect of the former type of error that a court can be held civilly liable in damages (under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which replaced section 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 - see paragraphs 27-28 below).\n25. The appropriate test for whether an order of a magistrates' court is void for lack of jurisdiction is that set out by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan [1985] Appeal Cases 528. In that case magistrates had made an order sending a 14-year-old boy to a training school after a hearing at which he was not legally represented, had not applied for legal aid and had not been informed of his right so to do. The order was quashed on judicial review on the ground that, by virtue of Article 15 (1) of the Treatment of Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, magistrates were not permitted to pass a custodial sentence for the first time on a juvenile who was not legally represented, unless he had applied for legal aid and been refused on grounds of means or had been informed of his right to apply for it but had refused or neglected to do so.\nThe boy then applied for damages for false imprisonment against the magistrates. Since the case was decided prior to the enactment of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and at a time when it was the law that magistrates were liable in damages for false imprisonment if they acted in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 26 below), the House of Lords was required to decide the jurisdictional question.\nIn its judgment, a magistrates' court acted in excess of jurisdiction in three circumstances only: (1) if it acted without having jurisdiction over the cause, (2) if it exercised its powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or (3) if it made an order that had no proper foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent. The instant case fell within the third limb of the rule: the magistrates were liable in damages because they had not observed the requirements of Article 15 (1) of the 1976 Order.\nDuring the course of his judgment speech, Lord Bridge commented (at page 546 E-F), on the jurisdiction of magistrates in conducting a criminal trial:\n\u201c... once justices have duly entered upon a summary trial of a matter within their jurisdiction, only something quite exceptional occurring in the course of their proceeding to a determination can oust their jurisdiction ... [A]n error (whether of fact or law) in deciding a collateral issue on which jurisdiction depends will not do so. Nor will the absence of any evidence to support a conviction ...\u201c\n26. The final limb of the rule formulated by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan (that is, that magistrates exceed their jurisdiction when they make an order which has no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent) was applied by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies [1989] 1 All England Reports 30, a case concerning rates (the predecessor to the community charge). Again, the issue was whether magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction and were therefore liable in damages for false imprisonment.\nThe plaintiff had been unable to pay all of the rates for which he became liable in December 1984, and in January 1986 he failed to follow his accountant's advice to close his business and to go bankrupt. Applying legislation similar to Regulation 41 of the Community Charge Regulations, the magistrates found that his failure to follow the accountant's advice constituted culpable neglect and they committed him to prison. The Court of Appeal held that no causal connection had been established between the failure to follow advice in 1986 and the failure to pay the rates in 1984, and that the magistrates had not properly entered into the inquiry (as to whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect) required by the legislation as a condition precedent of the warrant of commitment. They were therefore acting in excess of jurisdiction and were liable in damages.\nThe three Appeal Court judges expressed their findings in slightly different terms. Lord Justice O'Connor observed that \u201cthey never carried out the inquiry required [by the law]\u201c; Lord Justice Neill found that \u201csome inquiry about the applicant's finances was made\u201c, but that \u201ca clear and crucial distinction can be drawn between the inquiry required by the statute and the inquiry which was in fact carried out. The justices never examined the question whether the failure to pay was due to culpable neglect\u201c; and Sir Roger Ormrod (who dissented from the majority decision) said: \u201c... it is quite clear that the justices carried out an inquiry into means carefully and in detail ... It is equally plain that they misdirected themselves completely ... They ... failed to realise that the question they had to decide was whether the applicant's failure to pay his rates was `due either to his wilful refusal or to his culpable neglect'\u201c (see pp. 637 B, 642 H-643 G and 647 E).\n#### D. The immunity of magistrates from civil proceedings\n27. Magistrates enjoy a statutory immunity from civil liability in certain circumstances. Before the coming into force of section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 on 1 January 1991, this immunity was provided for by sections 44 and 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979. In brief, a magistrate was liable in damages for acts done by him in his official capacity if it could be proved either (1) that the act was done maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause or (2) that it was performed outside or in excess of jurisdiction (see paragraph 25 above for the meaning of the latter expression).\n28. The position under section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 is now that an action lies against a magistrate only if it can be proved that he acted both in bad faith and in excess of jurisdiction:\n\u201cAn action shall lie against any justice of the peace ... in respect of any act or omission of his -\n(a) in the purported execution of his duty -\n(i) as such a justice; ...\n(b) with respect to any matter which is not within his jurisdiction, if, but only if, it is proved that he acted in bad faith.\u201c\n#### E. Legal aid\n29. The legal-aid scheme does not provide for full representation before magistrates for proceedings for committal to prison for non-payment of the community charge. The \u201cGreen Form\u201c scheme provides at least two hours' worth of advice and assistance from a solicitor (the time limit can be extended), including preparation for a court case, but it does not provide for representation.\n30. Assistance by Way of Representation (\u201cABWOR\u201c) enables a magistrates' court, in certain circumstances, to appoint a solicitor who happens to be within the court precincts to represent a party who would not otherwise be represented. Regulation 7 (1) (b) of the Legal Advice and Assistance (Scope) Regulations 1989 provides that ABWOR may be given:\n\u201cat a hearing in any proceedings in a magistrates' court to a party who is not receiving and has not been refused representation in connection with those proceedings, where the court -\n(i) is satisfied that the hearing should proceed on the same day;\n(ii) is satisfied that that party would not otherwise be represented; and\n(iii) requests a solicitor who is within the precincts of the court for purposes other than the provision of ABWOR in accordance with this sub-paragraph, or approves a proposal from such a solicitor, that he provide that party with ABWOR ...\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n31. In his application (no. 19380/92) of 20 September 1991 to the Commission, the applicant complained that his detention between 25 March 1991 and 5 April 1991 was unlawful, in violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1); that section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1989 deprived him of an enforceable right to compensation in respect of it, contrary to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5); and that the fact that full legal aid was not available to him for the committal hearing before the magistrates constituted a violation of Article 6 (art. 6).\n32. The Commission declared the application admissible on 13 January 1994. In its report of 29 November 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by twelve votes to six, that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1); by seventeen votes to one that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5); and by fifteen votes to three that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the five separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment 3.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT\n33. At the hearing on 22 November 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violations of Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention (art. 5, art. 6).\n34. On the same occasion the applicant reiterated his request to the Court, stated in his memorial, to find that there had been breaches of Articles 5 and 6 (art. 5, art. 6) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 1 (art. 5-1) OF THE CONVENTION\n35. The applicant submitted that his detention between 25 March 1991 and 5 April 1991 constituted a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;\n(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\n(d) the detention of a minor by lawful order for the purpose of educational supervision or his lawful detention for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority;\n(e) the lawful detention of persons for the prevention of the spreading of infectious diseases, of persons of unsound mind, alcoholics or drug addicts or vagrants;\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201c\nThe Commission agreed with the applicant, whereas the Government contested his allegations.\n36. The applicant argued that the decision of the Divisional Court (see paragraphs 16-17 above) was not distinguishable from that of the Court of Appeal in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above) and amounted in substance to a ruling that his detention had been ordered by the magistrates in excess of their jurisdiction and was thus unlawful under English law. If this was so, it was in violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), which refers back to the position under national law.\nFurthermore, his imprisonment was not covered by any of the sub-paragraphs of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1). It did not result from a criminal conviction as required by Article 5 para. 1 (a) (art. 5-1-a), and, since he did not have any way of paying the debt, it could not have been intended to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law within the terms of Article 5 para. 1 (b) (art. 5-1-b).\nIn addition, he argued that his detention was manifestly arbitrary. The Divisional Court found that there was no evidence of culpable neglect and that the magistrates' decision to imprison him was unreasonable in the sense of being irrational or perverse. The magistrates, therefore, acted beyond their powers in imprisoning him, and the imposition of a penalty which is beyond the authorisation of the law is necessarily an arbitrary one.\nFinally, he contended that, since he was denied legal representation in violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6), the detention was for that reason unlawful.\n37. For the Commission, the weight of argument tended to the view that, in domestic law, the applicant's detention was not \u201clawful\u201c as required by Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1).\n38. The Government submitted that Mr Benham's detention was \u201clawful\u201c and \u201cin accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u201c for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1). The Community Charge Regulations (see paragraph 19 above) conferred on the magistrates' court the power to send him to prison if they were of the opinion that his failure to pay was due to culpable neglect. Unlike the magistrates in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above), the magistrates in the instant case did carry out the inquiry required by law as to whether Mr Benham's failure to pay resulted from culpable neglect. They made errors of fact and law in answering that question, but the Divisional Court did not find that these errors were such as to deprive them of jurisdiction.\n39. The Court first observes that this case falls to be examined under sub-paragraph (b) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-b), since the purpose of the detention was to secure the fulfilment of Mr Benham's obligation to pay the community charge owed by him.\n40. The main issue to be determined in the present case is whether the disputed detention was \u201clawful\u201c, including whether it complied with \u201ca procedure prescribed by law\u201c. The Convention here essentially refers back to national law and states the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules thereof, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be consistent with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect individuals from arbitrariness (see the Quinn v. France judgment of 22 March 1995, Series A no. 311, p. 18, para. 47).\n41. It is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law. However, since under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) failure to comply with domestic law entails a breach of the Convention, it follows that the Court can and should exercise a certain power to review whether this law has been complied with (see the Bouamar v. Belgium judgment of 29 February 1988, Series A no. 129, p. 21, para. 49).\n42. A period of detention will in principle be lawful if it is carried out pursuant to a court order. A subsequent finding that the court erred under domestic law in making the order will not necessarily retrospectively affect the validity of the intervening period of detention. For this reason, the Strasbourg organs have consistently refused to uphold applications from persons convicted of criminal offences who complain that their convictions or sentences were found by the appellate courts to have been based on errors of fact or law (see the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 55, and the report of the Commission of 9 March 1978 on application no. 7629/76, Krzycki v. Germany, Decisions and Reports 13, pp. 60-61).\n43. It was agreed by those appearing before the Court that the principles of English law which should be taken into account in this case distinguished between acts of a magistrates' court which were within its jurisdiction and those which were in excess of jurisdiction. The former were valid and effective unless or until they were overturned by a superior court, whereas the latter were null and void from the outset (see paragraph 24 above).\nIt was further submitted that the appropriate test under English law for deciding whether or not magistrates acted within their jurisdiction was that laid down by the House of Lords in McC. v. Mullan (see paragraph 25 above). The third limb of that test was relevant to the instant case, namely that magistrates exceeded their jurisdiction when they made an order which had no foundation in law because of a failure to observe a statutory condition precedent.\nThis limb was applied by the Court of Appeal in Manchester City Magistrates' Court, ex parte Davies (see paragraph 26 above). In that case the appeal court found that magistrates had acted in excess of jurisdiction when they committed a man to prison for non-payment of rates without having carried out the inquiry required by law as to whether his failure to pay was due to culpable neglect.\n44. In each of the two cases referred to above it was necessary for the courts to decide the jurisdictional issue, because at the relevant time damages could be awarded against magistrates who acted in excess of jurisdiction. However, section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 has since changed the law to provide that there is no right to damages unless magistrates acted in bad faith (see paragraph 28 above). For this reason, when the Divisional Court reviewed the magistrates' order for Mr Benham's detention, there", "001-57642": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF DARBY v. SWEDEN\n(Application no. 11581/85)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n23 October 1990\nIn the Darby case\uf02a,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court\uf02a\uf02a, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr L.-E. Pettiti,\nMr C. Russo,\nMr A. Spielmann,\nMr N. Valticos,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr I. Foighel,\nand also of Mr M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 May 1990 and on 24 September 1990,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Taxation in general\n17. The provisions regarding municipal income taxation in general are included in the Municipal Tax Act 1928, which has been amended on numerous occasions over the years. The references below to this Act and to other enactments are all to the version in force during the relevant period (1979-1981), unless otherwise stated.\n18. Liability to pay tax in Sweden was regulated in section 53, subsection 1, of the Municipal Tax Act: residents of Sweden were taxed on their world-wide income whereas non-residents had a more limited liability, covering, inter alia, income derived from employment in the Swedish public service.\nUnder Article 19 of the convention with Finland for the avoidance of double taxation (published in svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling (\u201cSFS\u201c - the official journal), 1977:812), the right to tax income derived from public service vested in the State which paid the remuneration (with certain exceptions not relevant here).\n19. Regarding the place of taxation in Sweden, section 59, subsections 1 and 3, of the Municipal Tax Act provided that income earned by a resident from employment was to be taxed in the municipality where he was formally registered as a resident (mantalsskriven).\nAccording to the Tax (Common Municipal Purposes) Act (lag om skatt f\u00f6r gemensamt kommunal \u00e4ndam\u00e5l), income earned by a non-resident from employment in, inter alia, the Swedish public service was to be taxed in Stockholm in the so-called Common District. The tax rate (10 per cent) applicable in this district was lower than the ordinary municipal tax rate. The tax levied was not destined for any specific municipality but was used for levelling out the burden of taxation between different municipalities or other administrative authorities. It did not include any tax payable to the Church of Sweden.\n20. As a result of an amendment to section 68 of the Municipal Tax Act and subsection 1 of the instructions relating to section 66 of the same Act (SFS 1978:925), certain non-residents were considered, with effect from 1 January 1979, to have sufficient connection with Sweden to be liable to pay the full municipal tax. The Government Bill (1978/79:58) containing these amendments did not mention the problems which might result for non-residents in relation to the Dissenters Tax Act.\nHenceforth, a non-resident with certain types of income, such as that derived from employment in the public service, and with a temporary abode in Sweden was no longer taxed in the Common District but in the municipality where he had first lived. This meant that he had to pay municipal tax at the same rate as a resident and also church tax.\n#### B. The church tax\n21. The church tax is collected together with the ordinary municipal tax. The rate is determined by the local parish council. This system has a long tradition and is based on the fact that the Lutheran Church of Sweden is the established church. Under the transitional provisions of the 1974 Constitution (regeringsformen), its parishes have a status similar to that of the municipalities - including the right of taxation.\n22. The Dissenters Tax Act was enacted in 1951 at the same time as the Freedom of Religion Act (lag 1951:680 om religionsfrihet) in order to secure better respect for freedom of religion (see Government Bill 1951:175, p. 75). Section 1 of the Dissenters Tax Act, made the following provision for a reduction in the church tax:\n\u201cChurch tax which is referred to in the 1961 Act on parish administration (lag 1961:436 om f\u00f6rsamlingsstyrelse) and is imposed either by decision of a parish council or otherwise in accordance with the principles that apply to the imposition of municipal tax, shall be levied on a person who was not a member of the Church of Sweden at the beginning of the tax year and who is formally registered as resident (mantalsskriven) in this country for the tax year at only 30 per cent of the amount assessed.\u201c\nThe registration requirement meant that the Dissenters Tax Act did not apply to persons who had only a temporary abode in Sweden. According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the Act, the reasons for this were that the case for reduction could not be argued with the same force in regard to persons who were not resident in Sweden as it could in regard to those who were, and that the procedure would be more complicated if the reduction applied to non-residents (Government Bill 1951:175, p.144).\nThe 30 per cent of the church tax that remained after the reduction was supposed to cover the costs borne by the parishes of certain administrative functions such as the keeping of population records and the maintenance of churchyards and other public burial-grounds.\n23. With effect from 1 January 1987, section 1 of the Dissenters Tax Act was amended in order to take into account the criticism made by the Parliamentary Ombudsman (see paragraph 15 above), so that the taxpayer no longer has to be registered as resident in Sweden in order to benefit from the reduction of the church tax (Government Bill 1986/87:45, p. 15).\n#### C. Membership of the Swedish Church\n24. Under the Freedom of Religion Act, as worded before 15 November 1979, membership of the Swedish Church was reserved to Swedish citizens and foreigners living in Sweden. In 1979 an amendment (SFS 1979:929) opened membership also to other groups of persons. In order to leave the Church, it is sufficient for the person concerned to notify his resignation to the church authorities of his parish. Special rules apply to minors.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n25. In his application of 20 November 1984 to the Commission (no. 11581/85), Dr Darby alleged violations of Article 6 para. 1 and Article 9 (art. 6-1, art. 9) of the Convention. He contended that he had been discriminated against by the Swedish authorities while working in Sweden because he was a Finnish citizen domiciled in the archipelago of \u00c5land; and he also challenged the interpretation of the Dissenters Tax Act to the effect that he had to pay the full church tax and claimed that this obligation infringed his civil rights.\n26. On 11 April 1988 the Commission declared admissible the complaint that he had been obliged to pay church tax and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\nIn its report of 9 May 1989 (made under Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that:\n(a) there had been a violation of Article 9 (art. 9) (by ten votes to three) and also of Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 9 (art. 14+9) by nine votes to four);\n(b) it was not necessary to examine whether there had been a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1) (by eleven votes to two).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to the present judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n27. Dr Darby complained of the fact that between 1979 and 1981 he had had to pay 3,065 Swedish kronor (see paragraph 16 above) as a special tax to the Church of Sweden to finance its religious activities. In his opinion, this amounted to a breach of Article 9 (art. 9) of the Convention and also of Article 14 of the Convention taken together either with Article 9 (art. 14+9) or with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art.14+P1-1).\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN TOGETHER WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 (art. 14+P1-1)\n28. Considering that the applicant\u2019s grievances relate mainly to allegedly discriminatory effects of the Swedish tax legislation, the Court finds it more natural to examine the case under Article 14 of the Convention taken together with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (art. 14+P1-1), which concerns the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.\n29. Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention reads:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this ", "001-67085": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF YANIKO\u011eLU v.

Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant alleged in particular that he had been denied a fair hearing on account of the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He further complained that the national courts had based their decisions on his police statement which had been taken under duress. Finally, he argued that the criminal proceedings against him had not been concluded within a reasonable time. In this respect he invoked Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention.\n#### A. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for failure to comply with the six-month rule. In this respect, they maintained that as the applicant was complaining of the lack of independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court, he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the date on which that court rendered its judgment, namely 27 November 1997.\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined in several cases similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-compliance with the six months\u2019 rule and has rejected them (see \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7 29, 6 February 2003 and Do\u011fan and Keser v. Turkey, nos. 50193/99 and 50197/99, \u00a7 17, 24 June 2004). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instance case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n20. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n21. In the light of its established case law (see, amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raise complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Independence and impartiality of the State Security Court\n22. The Government maintained that the state security courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubt about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on state security courts.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36).\n24. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for being a member of an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fear as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n25. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. Fairness of the proceedings\n26. Having regard to its finding that the applicant\u2019s right to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal has been infringed, the Court considers that it is unnecessary to examine the applicant\u2019s remaining complaints under Article 6 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see \u00c7\u0131raklar, cited above, \u00a7 45).\n##### 3. Length of the criminal proceedings\n27. The Government denied the applicant\u2019s allegation. They argued that the case was of a complex nature and that the national courts had to organise a trial involving fifteen defendants, all of whose involvement with the TDKP/GKB had to be established. They further maintained that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities.\n28. The Court observes that that the proceedings began on 12 November 1991 with the applicant\u2019s arrest and ended on 11 September 1998 with the decision of the Court of Cassation, upholding the applicant\u2019s conviction. They therefore lasted six years and nine months.\n29. The Court recalls in the first place that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, amongst many others, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n30. The Court considers that even though the case involved a certain degree of complexity since it involved the prosecution of fifteen accused persons, it cannot be said that this in itself justified the total length of the proceedings.\n31.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer while he was in police custody.\n11. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n12. As regards the merits, the Government maintained that, in assessing whether or not the trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings. As the applicant was represented by a lawyer during the proceedings before the State Security Court and the Court of Cassation, his right to a fair hearing had not been violated.\n13. The Court observes that it has already examined the same grievance in the case of Salduz v. Turkey and found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 ([GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7\u00a7 56-62, 27 November 2008). It has also examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned Salduz judgment.\n14. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the present case.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained under Article 3 that he had been subjected to psychological torture in police custody. Relying on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, he further complained that he had been held in police custody for a long time. Under Article 6, the applicant alleged that the State Security Court which had tried and convicted him was not an independent and impartial tribunal. He also complained about the length of the proceedings. Finally, the applicant alleged that his conviction, which was based on his visit to Iran, had been in violation of Article 7 of the Convention.\n16. However, the Court finds nothing whatsoever in the case file which might disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time and subsequent changes to domestic legislation are outlined in the following judgments; G\u00f6\u00e7 v. Turkey, [GC], no. 36590/97, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2002-V, and Erdal Ta\u015f v. Turkey, no. 77650/01, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, 19 December 2006.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained that the written opinion of the principal public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation had never been served on him, thus depriving him of the opportunity to put forward his counter-arguments. The applicant relied on Article 6 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Government suggested that, since the applicant had been acquitted in 2004, he could no longer be considered a victim. The Government invited the Court to strike the application out of the Court's list of cases in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n17. The applicant disagreed with the Government's arguments and maintained his complaints.\n18. The Court reiterates that \u201ca decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a 'victim' unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention\u201d (see Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999-VI). Only when these conditions are satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude examination of an application (see, for example, Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 52620/99, 20 March 2003).\n19. The Court notes that in 2002 the applicant was convicted by the Ankara State Security Court. He was sentenced to a fine and to two years and six months' imprisonment. It is true that following an amendment in domestic law the applicant subsequently had a retrial and, in 2004, was acquitted of the charges against him. However, the Court notes that, in the meantime, the applicant had already served his prison sentence. In the absence of any submissions by the Government concerning the possible avenues provided for in the domestic law for claiming compensation in respect of these periods, the Court cannot but observe that, as matters stand, no compensation has been paid to the applicant for any violation of his right in the first trial. The Court therefore concludes that the Government's objection that the applicant can no longer be considered a victim cannot be upheld.\n20.

It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n21.

The Government submitted that the application should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Government argued that, pursuant to Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the applicants could have challenged the length of their detention in custody. They further maintained that the applicants could have sought compensation pursuant to Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained.\n16. The applicants argued that the remedies suggested by the Government were ineffective. They submitted that, since the length of their detention in custody had been in conformity with the domestic law applicable at the time of their arrest, any application under Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or the provisions of Law no. 466 would have been useless.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na. As regards the applicant Erdal G\u00fcler\n17. The Court does not consider it necessary to determine whether Erdal G\u00fcler has exhausted domestic remedies, as his complaint is manifestly ill-founded for the following reason.\n18. The Court notes that, according to the documents submitted to the Court, Erdal G\u00fcler was taken into custody at 2 p.m. on 27 September 2000 by officers from the \u015e\u0131rnak provincial gendarmerie command and left the gendarmerie command at 11 a.m. on 1 October 2000. The Court observes that the period in question is less than ninety-six hours.\n19. Having regard to its jurisprudence in similar cases, and bearing in mind the context in which he was detained, the Court considers that the length of Erdal G\u00fcler\u2019s detention in custody does not contravene the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention since he was brought before a judge less than four days after his arrest (see \u00c7elik and \u0130mret v. Turkey (dec.), no. 44093/98, 26 September 2000).\n20.

Article 465 \u00a7 4 of the former Criminal Code provide as follows:\n\u201cIf the action does not cause any sickness or prevent the victim from attending his/her usual occupation (...) the offender shall be sentenced to 2 to 6 months' imprisonment or to a fine of TRL 200 to 2,500. However, the legal proceedings may be initiated only upon the victim's complaint.\u201d\n16. The relevant Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was in force at the time of the events, read as follows:\nArticle 302\n\u201cSave the exceptional circumstances described by law, the courts shall decide on objections filed against the penal orders without holding a hearing.\nIf the objection is upheld, the same court shall decide on the merits of the case.\u201d\nArticle 386\n\u201cThe judge at the magistrates' court may, without holding a hearing, rule on the offences which are within the jurisdiction of the Magistrates' Court and it may subsequently issue a penal order.\nOnly the sentencing to a fine, an imprisonment up to three months, a suspension of a certain profession and a seizure (...) may be adjudicated by a penal order. (...)\u201d\nArticle 387\n\u201cIf the judge at the magistrates' court considers that the lack of a hearing may put the offender in an unfavourable situation, then it could be decided to hold a hearing. \u201c\nArticle 388\n\u201cIn addition to the conviction, it should be noted in the penal order, the designation of the offence, the applicable provisions of law, the relevant evidence, and the possibility of raising an objection within eight days after its notification (...). The petition which raises an objection to the penal order shall be approved by the trial judge. (...)\u201d\nArticle 390\n\u201cA hearing shall be held if the objection is raised against an imprisonment sentence given by a penal order. (...)\nThe suspect can be represented by a defence counsel during the hearing. (...)\nThe objections against the penal orders (...) are examined by a judge at the criminal court of first instance, in line with the procedure described under Articles 301, 302 and 303. The objection would suspend the execution of the penal order.\u201d\n17. In a judgment given on 30 June 2004 the Constitutional Court declared Article 390 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure unconstitutional and a nullity. It held that lack of a hearing before the Criminal Court of First Instance that examines the objections to the penal order, would be in breach of the right to a fair hearing guaranteed under Article 6 of the Convention, as well as Article 36 of the Constitution.\n18. Moreover, the new Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure which came into force on 1 June 2005, contain no provision concerning penal orders.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that he did not receive a fair and public hearing, in the determination of the criminal charge against him. He further complained that he was not informed promptly of the accusation against him, he did not have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and that he was not allowed to defend himself in person or through a lawyer. He invoked Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (a), (b) and (c) of the Convention:\n\u201c1. In the determination (...) of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing (...).\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him;\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require; (...)\u201d\n20. The Government disputed these allegations. They contended that the penal order was issued by the Magistrate's Court in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This was a simplified procedure for minor crimes, aimed at diminishing the work load of the courts. Moreover they maintained that the Turkish law provided an option to object to penal orders.\n21. The Government further maintained that, following the coming into force of the new Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure the procedure of issuing of penal orders no longer exists in Turkish law.\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The general principles\n23.

Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nAlvina Gyulumyan,\nIneta Ziemele,\nLuis L\u00f3pez Guerra,\nAnn Power, judges,\nand Santiago Quesada, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 17 March 2009,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Unemployment benefits\n14. A person who is unemployed may be entitled to subsistence support through the unemployment insurance. The main regulations in this area are given in the Unemployment Insurance Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shets-f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring, SFS 1997:238; hereafter \u201cthe 1997 Act\u201c) and the Unemployment Funds Act (lagen om arbetsl\u00f6shetskassor, SFS 1997:239). Unemployment benefits are financed through membership contributions made by the members of the unemployment insurance funds and State funding. A person who is not a member of an unemployment insurance fund can still receive some benefit, a so-called basic insurance. Benefits are paid to a person who is unemployed and has fulfilled a qualifying period of employment, that is he or she has worked a certain number of months before becoming unemployed, and who fulfils certain basic qualifying conditions, for example, he or she must actively be looking for work. At the relevant time benefits were provided for a limited number of days. After that, a new qualifying period of employment had to be completed in order to qualify for a new period of benefits.\n15. According to Section 45(a) of the 1997 Act, the benefits will be reduced for a certain period if the beneficiary, without acceptable reasons, rejects suitable work or if he or she, without having expressly rejected the work, by his or her actions causes employment not to be realised. The third time this happens the beneficiary will be disqualified from receiving benefits. According to Section 46, the same will happen if a beneficiary without acceptable reasons rejects an assignment to a labour market policy programme (arbetsmarknadspolitiskt program). Decisions regarding the right to the benefits regulated in the 1997 Act can be appealed against to the administrative courts.\n#### B. The activity guarantee scheme and activity support\n16. The activity guarantee scheme was one of several different labour market policy programmes. The scheme ceased to be in force on 2 July 2007. According to Sections 8 and 21 of the 2000 Ordinance, a person could (the word \u201cmay\u201d (f\u00e5r) was used in the Ordinance) be assigned to the activity guarantee scheme if he or she was at least 20 years old, was or was at risk of becoming unemployed for a long time and was searching for work through the public employment service. Section 6 of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the programme had to be motivated in terms of labour market policy and, thus, an assignment could only be made if it appeared appropriate both for the individual and from an overall labour market policy perspective. Moreover, Section 7 stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would apply for as long as it was justified in terms of labour market policy.\n17. A person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would no longer be entitled to unemployment benefits. His or her subsistence would instead be paid according to the provisions in the Ordinance on Activity Support (f\u00f6rordning om aktivitetsst\u00f6d, SFS 1996:100). Section 23 of the 1997 Act stated that a person who entered into the activity guarantee scheme would lose his or her remaining days of unemployment benefits. In the preparatory works preceding the amendment of Section 23 of the 1997 Act the Government stated that it was not necessary to allow people who left the activity guarantee scheme a possibility to use their remaining days of unemployment benefits, \u201csince the system around the activity guarantee scheme means that no one should have to leave the activity guarantee without having his or her support secured\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 54).\n18. The Ordinance on Activity Support stated that a person who took part in, inter alia, the activity guarantee scheme was entitled to economic support. According to Section 5 of the Ordinance, a person who was or would have been entitled to unemployment benefits or who had received unemployment benefits for the longest period for which benefits could be provided, would be given activity support equivalent to the unemployment benefits he or she would have received under the 1997 Act. A person who was not entitled to benefits as described above would still be given a specific amount per day in activity support. When a person who had been taking part in a programme such as the activity guarantee ceased to be part of it, he or she was no longer entitled to the activity support.\n19. Section 37(a) of the 2000 Ordinance stated that an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would be revoked if a person assigned to it refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme without an acceptable reason. An assignment to the activity guarantee scheme would also be revoked if the individual did not act in a proper manner or otherwise disrupted the activities. Moreover, an assignment could be revoked if there were other special reasons to do so.\n20. According to Section 37(b) of the 2000 Ordinance, if an assignment to the activity guarantee scheme was revoked because the individual had refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, without an acceptable reason, the individual would (the word \u201cshall\u201d (skall) was used in the Ordinance) be reassigned to the activity guarantee scheme after a suspension of 45 days, if certain basic requirements were met. In the Government Bill which preceded the introduction of this provision, the Government noted that the consequences for those who had their assignment to the activity guarantee scheme revoked would be far-reaching unless they had fulfilled a new qualifying period of employment. The Government also observed that the activity guarantee scheme had the character of a last economic protection among the labour market policy measures for those who were, or were at a risk of becoming, unemployed for a long period. Thereafter the Government stated: \u201cThe person applying should therefore in principle have a right to participate in the activity guarantee until he or she finds a solution for his or her unemployment situation, on condition that he or she in an active way contributes to such a solution. ... A person who has had his or her assignment to the activity guarantee revoked on the ground that he or she has refused an offer of suitable work or another measure under the guarantee scheme, shall therefore be offered a new assignment to the guarantee.\u201d (Government Bill 2002/03:44 p. 66)\n21. Decisions regarding the revocation of an assignment to a labour market policy programme, including the activity guarantee scheme, were taken by the County Labour Board. Appeals against the County Labour Board\u2019s decision could be made to the National Labour Market Board. According to Section 39 of the 2000 Ordinance, no appeal lay against the National Labour Market Board\u2019s decisions.\n22. In connection with a reorganisation of the Labour Market Administration into the Employment Service, the issue of whether decisions regarding labour market policy programmes should be subject to appeal was considered by the Government. It first stated that there was a right to be assigned to the labour market policy measure called \u201cnew start jobs\u201d (nystartjobb) and then stated, inter alia, the following: \u201cIn the case of other labour market policy measures and financial compensation, assignment decisions to them depend to a great extent on the situation in the labour market. There is no right to receive such a measure and there is no right to retain it either. This means that the decisions to be taken by the new agency in these matters, including the revocation of a measure, do not need to be examined by a court. Nor are the decisions suited to an examination by a court.\u201d (Government Bill 2006/07:89 p 79)\n#### C. Appeals against an authority\u2019s decision\n23. The handling of matters in the Swedish public administration is regulated by the Administrative Procedure Act (f\u00f6rvaltningslagen, SFS 1986:223; hereafter \u201cthe 1986 Act\u201c). Section 3 \u00a7 1, of the 1986 Act states that the provisions in the Act are subsidiary if they differ from the provisions in any other act or ordinance. According to Section 22, a decision may be appealed against by any person whom the decision concerns, provided the decision affects him or her adversely and an appeal against the decision is permitted. Section 22(a) states that appeals are to be made to the administrative courts. The preparatory works (Government Bill 1997/98:101 pp 59 and 112) state that one of the purposes of Section 22(a) is to assign a competent court when a prohibition to appeal against a decision has to be set aside because it would be in violation of the Convention.\n24. On 1 July 2006 a new second paragraph was added to Section 3 of the 1986 Act which states that the provisions on appeal according to the Act should always apply if it is necessary in order to provide for everyone\u2019s right to a fair trial in the determination of their civil rights or obligations as laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. According to the preparatory works (Government Bill 2005/06:56 p 10), one of the reasons for amending the 1986 Act was to make it clear that the 1986 Act\u2019s provisions on appeal applied regardless of what was stated in other acts or provisions, if this was necessary in order to satisfy the right to access to court in accordance with the Convention.\n25. Section 21 \u00a7 2 of the 1986 Act states that an authority has an obligation to inform a party about how to appeal against all decisions that affect the party adversely, if the decision can be appealed against.\n26. In a decision of 22 November 1994 (NJA 1994 p. 657) the Swedish Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen) found that a dispute over agricultural subsidies concerned a civil right in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention and found that a trial before a court should be allowed. Therefore, the court set aside the prohibition to appeal against the authority\u2019s decision. Similarly, the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten) has set aside prohibitions to appeal against different authorities\u2019 decisions, when the cases concerned civil rights and obligations (see, for example, decision of 25 November 1997 in R\u00c5 1997 ref. 65 and decision of 30 November 2001 in R\u00c5 2001 ref. 56).\n#### D. The State\u2019s liability to pay damages\n27. It follows from Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Tort Liability Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, SFS 1972:207) that the State is liable to pay compensation for, inter alia, financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority. From Chapter 3, Section 3 of the Act it follows that, under certain circumstances, the State is liable to pay compensation for financial loss caused by an erroneous instruction or advice given by an authority.\n28. In a judgment of 9 June 2005 (NJA 2005 p. 462), the Supreme Court found that an individual had a right to bring a civil action against the State before the national courts on the ground that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because a criminal case against the individual had not been concluded within a reasonable time. The Supreme Court has subsequently, in a judgment on 21 September 2007 (NJA 2007 p. 584), found that individuals have a right to bring civil suits against the State for violations against any Articles of the Convention when the State, according to the Convention, has an obligation to pay damages for the violation and such obligation cannot be based on national legislation.\n29. Anyone who wishes to claim compensation from the State for financial loss, which he or she considers to have been caused by a wrongful decision taken by a court or an administrative State authority, can proceed in two different ways: He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice in accordance with Section 3 of the Ordinance on the Administration of Claims for Damages against the State (F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten, SFS 1995:1301), or bring a civil action against the State in the ordinary courts. No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of Justice. However, if the claim is rejected, the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings before the courts.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n30. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that she was not able to appeal against the decision by the Board, thereby being denied access to court. This provision provides in so far as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n(a) Parties\u2019 submissions\n31. The Government submitted that the complaint under Article 6 should be declared inadmissible as incompatible ratione materiae on the ground that the Board\u2019s decision did not involve a dispute over a \u201cright\u201d as understood by Article 6 of the Convention.\n32. Initially, the Government referred to Government Bill 2006/07:89, p. 79, where it was stated that decisions concerning labour market policy programmes other than \u201cnew start jobs\u201d were largely dependent on the labour market situation and that there was no right to be assigned to or be allowed to remain in a programme. Thus, they argued that the applicant could derive no right from the national legislation to be assigned to or allowed to remain in any labour market policy programme, including the activity guarantee scheme. This was so, according to the Government, due to the fact that the provisions governing the labour market policy programmes were worded in such a way that they did not lay down tangible eligibility criteria that could be examined without difficulty by the competent authorities and, upon appeal, by the national courts.\n33. The Government further submitted that several features of the relevant legal provisions, most notably the 2000 Ordinance, showed that there were no arguable grounds to claim a right to be assigned to a labour market policy programme. Referring to the wording of Section 8 of the 2000 Ordinance, which listed certain criteria for eligibility to be assigned to a labour market policy programme, the Government pointed out that the word \u201cmay\u201d had been used consciously by the Government in order to show that being assigned to a labour market policy programme or being allowed to remain in such a programme was not to be considered as a right. By using the word \u201cmay\u201d, the Government underlined that the sphere of labour market policy programmes should be governed by current labour market policy concerns which gave the authorities unfettered discretion to decide whether and to which individuals such programmes should be assigned.\n34. Furthermore, the Government argued that another pertinent feature of the provisions governing labour market policy programmes was the requirement laid down in Sections 6 and 7 of the 2000 Ordinance, which provided that an assignment to a programme had to be \u201cmotivated in terms of labour market policy\u201d. According to the Government, that criterion was laid down so that the authorities could refrain from assigning a person to a programme or cancel a person\u2019s assignment to the programme with reference to overall labour market policy. That policy criterion also demonstrated the unfettered discretion available for the authorities when deciding whether to assign a person to a programme. As a consequence, no attention whatsoever should be paid to a person\u2019s need or suitability for assignment to a programme if the individual\u2019s participation in the programme was not appropriate from an overall labour market policy perspective. It was, in other words, left entirely up to the authorities implementing the Government\u2019s labour market policies to decide whether a person should be assigned to or allowed to stay in a programme.\n35. The Government submitted that, should the Court find that the applicant could arguably derive a right to remain in the activity guarantee scheme from the national legislation at issue, it recognised that such a right must be considered to be a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n36. The applicant submitted that a distinction had to be made when examining the existence of a civil right in the domestic system between applications for rights not yet received and revocations of already existing rights. The primary issue in the instant case, according to the applicant, was not whether there was discretion in assigning a person to a labour market policy programme, but rather whether an authority had an absolute discretion to revoke a person\u2019s existing assignment to a programme.\n37. The applicant argued that the relevant provisions in the 2000 Ordinance, on which the decision to exclude the applicant from the activity guarantee scheme was based, were quite detailed and certainly contained tangible criteria. Therefore, the applicant argued, the authorities did not have unfettered powers to revoke her assignment to the activity guarantee scheme.\n38. The applicant also claimed that, while assignments to the programmes may be refused in the form of general measures, for instance for budgetary reasons, thus affecting a number of unidentified applicants seeking an assignment after a certain date or between certain dates, she disputed that a revocation of an already decided and ongoing assignment was permissible for budgetary reasons. The applicant further submitted that there had to be a clear distinction between general measures such as forming and shaping the programmes and setting budgets and so on, and the individual measures, such as revoking an assignment due to reasons connected with the individual\u2019s alleged behaviour and suitability.\n39. The applicant further stressed that the statements made in Government Bill 2006/07:89, p. 79 (see \u00a7 22 above), were made after the revocation of the applicant\u2019s assignment to the programme.\n40. Furthermore, the applicant argued that the word \u201cmay\u201d was used in many Swedish regulations whereby individuals could apply for various rights recognised under domestic law, if certain conditions were met. The mere use of the word \u201cmay\u201d did not, according to the applicant, normally mean that authorities had an unfettered discretion in granting or refusing to grant the right.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n41. The Court reiterates that, according to the principles laid down in its case-law, it must ascertain whether there was a dispute (\u201ccontestation\u201d) over a \u201cright\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not in itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) \u201crights and obligations\u201c in the substantive law of the Contracting States. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. Finally, the right must be civil in character (see, for example, Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 2), 19 February 1998, \u00a7 38, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011I).\n42. The Court first has to consider whether or not the right claimed by the applicant exists in Sweden. In this respect, it observes that the Convention does not grant a person a right to be assigned to or be allowed to stay in a labour market policy programme. It follows that the question of whether such a right can be said in any particular case to exist must be answered solely with reference to domestic law. In this connection, in deciding whether a right, civil or otherwise, could arguably be said to be recognised under Swedish law, the Court must have regard to the wording of the relevant legal provisions and to the way those provisions are interpreted by the domestic courts (see Masson and Van Zon v. the Netherlands, 28 September 1995, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 327\u2011A).\n43. The Court reiterates that the existence of a margin of discretion on the part of the domestic authorities does not necessarily preclude the applicability of Article 6. If the subject of the court proceedings in question was a discretionary decision which interfered with the applicant\u2019s rights, the Court has held Article 6 to be applicable (see Pudas v. Sweden, 27 October 1987, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 125\u2011A and Mats Jacobsson v. Sweden, 28 June 1990, \u00a7 32, Series A no. 180\u2011A).\n44. However, if the subject of the national proceedings was a discretionary decision as to whether the applicant was to receive certain benefits or was entitled to actions by the authorities, the Court has held that unfettered discretion or even a wide margin of discretion on the part of the domestic authorities indicated that no \u201cright\u201d to those benefits or actions is recognised under domestic law. As a consequence, Article 6 is not applicable to those proceedings (see Masson and van Zon, cited above, \u00a7 51; and Ankarcrona v. Sweden (dec.), no. 35178/97, ECHR 2000\u2011VI).\n45. The Court has furthermore specified that a \u201cright\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 must be related to certain tangible criteria, which can be examined without difficulties by the competent authorities, and upon appeal, by the national courts (see Ankarcrona, cited above).\n46. As regards the authorities\u2019 decisions to assign persons to the activity guarantee scheme, the Court notes that the relevant ", "001-78447": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF WOJTUNIK v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Wojtunik v. Poland,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr L. Garlicki,\nMs L. Mijovi\u0107,\nMr J. \u0160ikuta, judges\nand Mr T.L. Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 November 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n21. The proceedings began on 1 December 1992 and ended on 28 January 1999. They therefore lasted 6 years, 1 month and 28 days. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect.\n22. The period under the Court\u2019s scrutiny lasted therefore 5 years, 8 months and 29 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n23. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that after 17 September 2004, when the 2004 Act had come into force, the applicant had the possibility of lodging with the Polish civil courts a claim for compensation for damage suffered on account of the excessive length of proceedings under Article 417 of the Civil Code read together with section 16 of the 2004 Act. They maintained that the three-year limitation period for the purposes of a compensation claim in tort based on the excessive length of proceedings could run from a date later than the date on which a final decision in these proceedings had been given.\n24. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n25. The Court observes that in the present case the proceedings at issue ended on 28 January 1999, which is more than three years before the relevant provisions of the 2004 Act read together with the Civil Code became effective. It follows that the limitation period for the State\u2019s liability for tort set out in Article 442 of the Civil Code had expired before 17 September 2004.\n26. The Court notes that the arguments raised by the Government are the same as those already examined and rejected by the Court in previous cases against Poland (see Ma\u0142asiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003; Ratajczyk v. Poland; (dec), 11215/02, 31 May 2005; Barszcz v. Poland, no. 71152/01, 30 May 2006) and the Government have not submitted any new elements which would lead the Court to depart from its previous findings.\n27. The Government further submitted that such a possibility had existed in Polish law even before the entry into force of the 2004 Act following the the Constitutional Court judgment of 4 December 2001, which took effect on 18 December 2001.\n28. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments.\n29. The Court notes that it has already examined whether after 18 December 2001 and prior to the entry into force of the Law of 17 June 2004 a compensation claim in tort as provided for by Polish civil law was an effective remedy in respect of complaints about the length of proceedings. It held that no evidence of any judicial practice had been provided to show that a claim for compensation based on Article 417 of the Civil Code had ever been successful before the domestic courts (see Skawi\u0144ska v. Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003 and Malasiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, 14 October 2003). As the Government have failed to submit any new arguments which would cast doubt on its conclusions in these cases, the Court will abide by its previous findings.\n30. For these reasons, the Government\u2019s plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n32. The applicant complained about the length of the civil proceedings.\n33. The Government submitted that the case was very complex and difficult. In particular, the courts had to examine the nature of the activities performed by the applicant in three companies as well as the structural changes which had taken place within the business of the applicant\u2019s former employer.\n34. The Government further maintained that the interests of the applicant were of a purely pecuniary nature.\n35. The applicant did not comment on these issues.\n36. The Government were of the opinion that, as regards the conduct of the authorities, the courts had conducted the proceedings with due diligence and that there were no periods of inactivity by the courts. They further stated that \u201cspecial diligence\u201d was not required in this case, unlike the position in cases concerning employment and pensions.\n37. The applicant contested the Government\u2019s arguments, stating that hearings had not been held at ", "001-95777": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OMOJUDI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n16. Section 3(5)(a)0 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999) provides that a person who is not a British citizen shall be liable to deportation from the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good. Sections 82(1) and 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provide for a right of appeal against this decision on the grounds, inter alia, that the decision is incompatible with the Convention.\n17. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen.\n18. A person who has been deported may apply to have the deportation order revoked. Paragraphs 390 to 392 of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) provide that:\n\u201c390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will be considered in the light of all the circumstances including the following:\n(i) the grounds on which the order was made;\n(ii) any representations made in support of revocation;\n(iii) the interests of the community, including the maintenance of an effective immigration control;\n(iv) the interests of the applicant, including any compassionate circumstances.\n391. In the case of an applicant who has been deported following conviction for a criminal offence continued exclusion\n(i) in the case of a conviction which is capable of being spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, unless the conviction is spent within the meaning of that Act or, if the conviction is spent in less than 10 years, 10 years have elapsed since the making of the deportation order; or\n(ii) in the case of a conviction not capable of being spent under that Act, at any time, unless refusal to revoke the deportation order would be contrary to the Human Rights Convention or the Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\nwill normally be the proper course. In other cases revocation of the order will not normally be authorised unless the situation has been materially altered, either by a change of circumstances since the order was made, or by fresh information coming to light which was not before, or the appellate authorities or the Secretary of State. The passage of time since the person was deported may also in itself amount to such a change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.\n392. Revocation of a deportation order does not entitle the person concerned to re\u2011enter the United Kingdom; it renders him eligible to apply for admission under the Immigration Rules. Application for revocation of the order may be made to the Entry Clearance Officer or direct to the Home Office.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant submitted that his deportation to Nigeria violated his right to respect for his family and private life under Article 8 of the Convention. Article 8 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n20. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties' submissions\n22. The applicant submitted that prior to his deportation he enjoyed family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention with his spouse, his three children and with his grandchild. He had co-habited with his spouse since 1980 and they have been married for twenty-two years. Their three children were born in the United Kingdom and have always lived in the family home. Even though the eldest child was an adult when the applicant was deported, he was not an independent person who had started his own family life. Rather, he was a student who still lived in the family home and who depended financially and emotionally on his parents. His daughter lived with him and prior to the applicant's deportation he relied on both of his parents to help him raise her while he pursued his studies. Following his deportation he relied solely on his mother.\n23. The applicant submitted that his deportation interfered with his right to respect for his family life because his family was split up without any prospect of being reunited in the near future. Relocation was not an option for the family because his teenage children were British nationals who were being educated in the United Kingdom. His eldest son had a child of his own in the United Kingdom. The applicant's wife could not relocate with the applicant because she had to stay to take care of the children and to help raise her grandchild. The only communication which the applicant had had with his family following his deportation was via telephone and written communication.\n24. The applicant accepted that the interference with his right to respect for his family and private life was in accordance with the law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. He argued, however, that it was not necessary in a democratic society. He relied on the official risk assessment report prepared by the Probation Service, which indicated that he posed a low risk of reoffending.\n25. The applicant further relied on the judgment of the Grand Chamber in \u00dcner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, ECHR 2006\u2011XII. With regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence, he submitted that the only relevant offence was the one which the deportation order specifically held as the basis for the deportation, namely the sexual assault committed on 1 November 2005. As the Secretary of State for the Home Department was fully apprised of the applicant's previous offending and immigration history when he exercised his discretion to grant him Indefinite Leave to Remain in 2005, he could not now rely on his earlier offences in order to justify the decision to deport him. If considered in isolation, the applicant submitted that the sexual assault was not sufficiently serious to warrant deportation. In particular, he submitted that the sentence imposed for this offence, being less than two years, would not have resulted in a decision to deport under the policies in place at the time. This was reflected in the fact that the sentencing judge did not recommend deportation.\n26. The applicant indicated that prior to his deportation he had lived in the United Kingdom for twenty six consecutive years. He had not returned to Nigeria during that period, except for a three-week vacation in the summer of 2005. His residence in the United Kingdom was lawful between 1982 and 1986, and between 2005 and 2008. Between 1986 and 2000 he was attempting to regularise his stay and between 2000 and 2005 he was waiting for the outcome of his application under the Regularisation Scheme for Overstayers. While the applicant accepted that he had spent his formative years in Nigeria, he submitted that his ties to his home country were significantly weakened and by the date of his deportation he had vastly stronger ties to the United Kingdom.\n27. Three years passed between the applicant's last offence and his deportation. The applicant submitted that during that period he served his sentence and complied with the conditions of his licence. He engaged in offence-focussed work and his conduct was good, both in prison and upon release. He further indicated that between offences lengthy periods passed without transgression. In this respect the case could be distinguished from that of Joseph Grant v. the United Kingdom, no. 10606/07, 8 January 2009, where the applicant had no significant period of residence in the United Kingdom during which he did not offend.\n28. The applicant also contended that his wife would experience serious difficulties were she to follow him to Nigeria. She left Nigeria in 1983 and had been living in the United Kingdom ever since. Apart from her elderly mother she had no family or social ties in Nigeria. Relocation would separate her from her eldest child and from her grandchild and cause her significant distress. The teenage children would also face serious difficulties if they were to relocate to Nigeria. They had no links with Nigeria and could no longer be described as being \u201cof an adaptable age\u201d. Their personal and professional development would be severely hampered if they were to move to Nigeria and thus such a move could not be described as being \u201cin their best interests\u201d. Moreover, Nigeria was not a Member State of the Council of Europe and the living conditions there were unlike those in which the applicant's children had been brought up.\n29. The Government accepted that the applicant and his wife had a genuine, long-standing marriage and that family life existed between them. They further accepted that family life existed between the applicant and his two younger children, although they pointed out that they would come of age in October 2009 and September 2010 respectively. They contended, however, that no family life existed between the applicant and his eldest son as there was no evidence of dependency involving more than the normal emotional ties of father and adult son.\n30. The Government submitted that the applicant's deportation was a measure taken in accordance with the law and that any resulting interference with his right to respect for his family life under Article 8(1) of the Convention was proportionate in the interests of the prevention of crime.\n31. In relation to the nature and seriousness of the applicant's offence, the Government submitted that it was appropriate to have regard to the applicant's background of offending as well as to the offence which directly gave rise to the decision to make a deportation order. The applicant had been convicted of nine criminal offences during his time in the United Kingdom, including a number of offences of deception and dishonesty, which demonstrated a persistent disregard for United Kingdom law. The most serious offence warranted a sentence of four years' imprisonment and was described by the Court of Appeal as a significant conspiracy to defraud London clearing banks of in excess of GBP 60,000.\n32. In any case, the Government submitted that the offence committed by the applicant on 1 November 2005 was of itself a serious offence, warranting his registration as a sex offender for ten years in addition to a fifteen month term of imprisonment. Although the probation service recognised that the applicant's overall risk of re-conviction was low, the Government observed that he was assessed as presenting a medium risk of serious harm to known adults in the community. They therefore contended that they were entitled to regard a sexual offence involving the abuse of a position of trust as a serious matter and attach considerable weight to that factor.\n33. Although the Government recognised that the applicant had spent over twenty four years in the United Kingdom at the date of the decision to deport him, they submitted that he was an adult when he arrived and during his stay he served two periods of imprisonment. Moreover, for the majority of his stay his immigration status was precarious as he had been refused extensions to his leave as a student, he was refused asylum and he had been the subject of deportation action. Indeed, the offence which prompted the decision to make a deportation order was committed only six months after he was eventually granted Indefinite Leave to Remain.\n34. The Government further submitted that just over one year had elapsed from the commission of the sexual assault and the decision to make a deportation order. During that period the applicant was convicted of a further offence (failing to provide a specimen for analysis) and was disqualified from driving for three years.\n35. Finally, the Government contended that the applicant had put forward no evidence to demonstrate that he and his wife had developed strong social and/or cultural ties with the United Kingdom. Although it was accepted that the applicant was employed by a housing association at the time he committed the sexual assault, there was no other evidence to suggest that he or his wife were ever employed in the United Kingdom. The applicant's wife was a Nigerian citizen who had spent her formative years in Nigeria. Her mother still lived there and she had clearly maintained some ties with that country. The Government further contended that while the applicant's two younger children would face a degree of hardship in relocating to Nigeria, they were intelligent young people with no particular disabilities or needs and with the support of their parents they would be able to adjust to life in Nigeria. There was no evidence to suggest that it would be \u201cimpossible or exceptionally difficult\u201d for the applicant's wife and younger children to relocate with him (see Onur v. the United Kingdom, no. 27319/07, \u00a7 60, 17 February 2009). Alternatively, should the applicant's family decide to remain in the United Kingdom, they could maintain contact with the applicant by letter or telephone and visit him for holidays in Nigeria.\n##### 2. The Court's assessment\n(a) Was there an interference with the applicant's right to respect for his family and private life?\n36. The Government have accepted that the applicant's deportation interfered with his family life as reflected in his relationship with his wife and two youngest children. The Court endorses this view. Having regard to the concession made by the Government as to the existence of family life, it is unnecessary to decide whether the close bond which the applicant undoubtedly had with his eldest son and his granddaughter was itself sufficient to give rise to family life between them.\n37. The Court further recalls that, as Article 8 also protects the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's social identity, it must be accepted that the totality of social ties between settled migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of the concept of \u201cprivate life\u201d within the meaning of Artic", "001-59853": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF DEVLIN v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 April and 9 October 2001,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. By virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d), it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment.\n16. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act (as amended by the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989), a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n17. Section 42 of the 1976 Act (as amended) provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub-section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\n18. The Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended by the 1976 Act) provides as follows in section 19:\n\u201c(1) Subject to sub-section (4) below it shall be unlawful for a Minister of the Crown ... and any authority or body listed ... in ... Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 ... to discriminate, or aid, induce or incite another to discriminate, in the discharge of functions relating to Northern Ireland against any person or class of persons on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion. ...\n(4) This section does not apply to any act or omission which is unlawful by virtue of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 or would be unlawful but for some exception made by virtue of Part V of that Act.\u201d\n19. Schedule 1 to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 lists the departments and authorities subject to investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner. The list includes the Northern Ireland Civil Service Commission and all Government Departments, including the Department of Finance and Personnel. However, section 42 of the 1976 Act falls within Part V of that Act. Accordingly, where a section 42 certificate has been issued (claiming an act was done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order), section 19(1) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (as amended) has no effect.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant complained that he had been deprived of the right to have his claim under the Fair Employment Act determined by a court, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which provides as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n21. The applicant submitted that the present case concerned the right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in the job market, which right was as such a \u201ccivil\u201d right falling within the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. He was not claiming a right of access to the civil service but a right of equal treatment. There was a civil right at stake in the proceedings brought by him in the Fair Employment Tribunal and Article 6 was applicable.\n22. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as they arose out of his unsuccessful application for a civil service post and therefore did not concern the determination of a \u201ccivil\u201d right. The Government quoted the Court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area which recognised the special status accorded in Contracting States to public servants and, in particular, their right to maintain the procedures necessary to ensure the integrity of those recruited into the civil service (see, amongst others, the Glasenapp v. Germany judgment of 28 August 1986, Series A no. 104; the Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, and the Commission\u2019s decision in Quinn v. the United Kingdom, no. 33694/96, 23 October 1997, unpublished). In the more recent case of Pellegrin v. France ([GC] no. 28541/95, ECHR 1999-II), disputes concerning posts involving the exercise of state authority were still excluded, and this applicant would have been working in a position of trust in a Department which wielded a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power. In their view, Tinnelly case (Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others, and McElduff and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, p. 1633) was not relevant to the present case which concerned, in their view, a dispute about recruitment to the civil service which fell outside the scope of the Convention.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n23. The Court must determine whether Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable to the present case, in particular whether the claim submitted by the applicant before the Fair Employment Tribunal concerned the determination of a civil right. It recalls that in the Tinnelly case (cited above, pp. 1656-1657, \u00a7\u00a7 61-63) the Court considered that the 1976 Act, which was also invoked by the applicant in this case, guaranteed persons a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in the job market. That clearly defined right, having regard to the context in which it operated and to its pecuniary nature, was accordingly classified by the Court as a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n24. The Government have argued that this case should be distinguished from that of Tinnelly as it concerned, not disputes about works contracts, but access to the civil service to which special considerations have always attached. They have relied on previous precedents in not dissimilar cases, including the case of Quinn v. the United Kingdom decided by the Commission (no. 33694/96, decision of 23 October 1997). That case concerned the dismissal of an individual working in the Northern Ireland Passport Office and the subsequent issue of a section 42 certificate, denying him access to the Fair Employment Tribunal. The Commission held that Mr Quinn\u2019s application was inadmissible, following the Court\u2019s decision in Neigel v. France (judgment of 17 March 1997, Reports 1997-II) that the dispute between the applicant, a civil servant, and his State employer did not determine his \u201ccivil\u201d rights within the meaning of Article 6.\n25. However, the Court must now take into account its subsequent judgment in Pellegrin v. France (cited above), which reviewed the case-law concerning civil servants and sought to resolve the uncertainties which had arisen. That case laid down a new test to be applied in order to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to public servants. Under this test the only disputes excluded from Article 6 \u00a7 1 are those which are raised by public servants \u201cwhose duties typify the specific activities of the public service in so far as the latter is acting as the depository of public authority responsible for protecting the general interests of the State or other public authorities\u201d (see \u00a7 66). The Court referred to individuals in the public-service sector who \u201cwield a portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power,\u201d as being those whose disputes are likely to fall outside the ambit of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n26. The Court is of the view that the post of administrative assistant (which is described as the lowest grade in the non-industrial Civil Service) is not a post where it can be said the incumbent was wielding \u201ca portion of the State\u2019s sovereign power\u201d. Even if such a postholder were part of a Department which did have such influence and could, potentially, apply for higher post, the Court does not find that an administrative assistant of this kind falls within the category of public servant described in the Pellegrin case. There is no reason to exclude the applicant\u2019s dispute from the ambit of Article 6 and the applicant can therefore claim, as in the Tinnelly case, that he had a \u201ccivil right\u201d under the 1976 Act not to be discriminated against in the employment sphere. Accordingly, Article 6 is applicable to the proceedings alleging discrimination which he brought under that Act.\n#### B. Compliance with Article 6 of the Convention\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n27. The applicant submitted that he had been denied access to court in the determination of his civil right, relying on the Tinnelly judgment (cited above) in which the Court found a breach of Article 6 due to the effect of a section 42 certificate in blocking proceedings in the Fair Employment Tribunal. In his view, section 42 of the 1976 Act", "001-60793": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF RADAJ v.

Tulkens,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr E. Levits,\nMrs S. Botoucharova,\nMrs E. Steiner,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr S. Nielsen, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 7 November 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. The situation of persons detained on remand was at the relevant time governed by the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1969. Under Article 89, all correspondence of a detainee was to be opened, read and, if need be, subject to censorship, unless a prosecutor and a court decided otherwise. No provision of the Code provided for any remedy to contest the manner or scope of the censorship of a detainee\u2019s correspondence.\n13. The rights of persons detained on remand as regards their correspondence were further set out in Section 33 of the Rules on Detention on Remand. They provided that the correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to screening by prison authorities and by authority conducting the criminal proceedings, i.e. either a public prosecutor or a court, depending on the stage reached in the proceedings.\n14. On 6 July 1997 a new Code of Enforcement of Criminal Sentences was enacted by parliament. Article 102 of this Code, which entered into force on 1 January 1998, provides that the convicted persons are entitled to uncensored correspondence with the State authorities and with the Ombudsman. Article 103 of the Code further provides that convicted persons and their lawyers may lodge complaints with the international agencies established under international treaties on protection of human rights, ratified by Poland. Prisoners\u2019 correspondence in such cases shall be dispatched with no delay and is not subject to censorship.\n15. Pursuant to Article 512 of the new Code, the rights of persons detained on remand shall, in principle, be the same as those of persons convicted by a final judgment.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. The applicant complained that, while he was detained on remand, his correspondence with the organs of the European Convention of Human Rights had been intercepted, opened and read by the domestic authorities. He invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which in its relevant part reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his (...) correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n17. The Government submitted that the control over correspondence of detained persons was not in itself incompatible with the Convention. Polish law, namely the provisions of Rules of Detention on Remand, in particular their Section 33, as applicable at the material time, provided that correspondence of persons detained on remand was subject to control by either the prosecuting authorities or by a court. Therefore the interference complained of was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d.\n18. The Government further argued that there were no reasons to doubt that the control of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was carried out to ensure that it did not contain material which would be harmful to prison security or the safety of others or otherwise of a criminal nature. As to the letters from the organs of the European Convention of Human Rights, the control exercised by the court had had a purely technical character and had pursued a legitimate aim within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.\n19. The applicant submitted that his correspondence with the Convention organs should not have been intercepted, opened and read by the domestic authorities.\n20. The Court first finds that the practice of opening and reading prisoners\u2019 letters amounts to an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for correspondence within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court also recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition guaranteed under Article 34 of the Convention that applicants or potential applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Convention organs without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see the Akdivar and Others and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996-IV judgment, p. 1219, \u00a7 105; the Kurt v. Turkey judgment of 25 May 1998, Reports 1998-III, p. 1192, \u00a7 159) The Court is well aware that no allegations of undue pressure have been made in the present case. However, it considers that it is of prime importance for the effective exercise of the right of individual petition under the Convention that the correspondence of prisoners with the Court is not subject to any form of control, which might potentially hinder them in b", "001-90967": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF NICOLA v.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE\n14. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died on 25 May 1992, after the lodging of his application, while the case was pending before the Court. His son, who had become the administrator of his estate, informed the Court that he wished to pursue the application lodged by him (see paragraph 4 above). Although the heirs of a deceased applicant cannot claim a general right for the examination of the application brought by the latter to be continued by the Court (see Scherer v. Switzerland, 25 March 1994, Series A no. 287), the Court has accepted on a number of occasions that close relatives of a deceased applicant are entitled to take his or her place (see Deweer v. Belgium, 27 February 1980, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 35, and Raimondo v. Italy, 22 February 1994, \u00a7 2, Series A no. 281-A).\n15. For the purposes of the instant case, the Court is prepared to accept that the applicant\u2019s son can pursue the application initially brought by Mr Loukas Nicola (see, mutatis mutandis, Kirilova and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 42908/98, 44038/98, 44816/98 and 7319/02, \u00a7 85, 9 June 2005, and Nerva and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 42295/98, \u00a7 33, ECHR 2002\u2011VIII).\n### II. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n16. The Government raised preliminary objections of inadmissibility ratione loci and ratione temporis, non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and lack of victim status. The Court observes that these objections were identical to those raised in the case of Alexandrou v. Turkey (no. 16162/90, \u00a7\u00a7 11-22, 20 January 2009), and should be dismissed for the same reasons.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that since July 1974 Turkey had prevented him from exercising his right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.\nHe invoked Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n18. The Government disputed this claim.\n#### A. The arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n19. The Government submitted that the property claimed by the applicant was situated outside the jurisdiction of Turkey and that the latter had no knowledge about it. In any event, the applicant had not produced any evidence supporting his claim to ownership. His house in Trypimeni village had not been occupied or used by the Turkish army. Moreover, the applicant had not applied through the proper channels to visit his alleged property. He had not even attempted to enter the northern part of Cyprus at an approved crossing point, and had not been prevented from doing so by Turkish and/or Turkish-Cypriot forces. He had been stopped on the southern side of the buffer zone by UNFICYP. The Turkish forces had not been involved in the incident.\n20. Finally, the alleged interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights could not be seen in isolation from the general political situation on the island of Cyprus and had been in any event justified in the general interest.\n##### 2. The applicant\n21. The applicant submitted that he had produced a photocopy of the original title deed of ownership of his house in Trypimeni. He relied on the principles laid down by the Court in the Loizidou v. Turkey judgment ((merits) of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI) and recalled that on 9 December 1990 he had been prevented from returning to his property.\n#### B. The third-party intervener\u2019s arguments\n22. The Government of Cyprus observed that their department of Lands and Surveys had provided certificates confirming ownership to those persons who did not have title deeds in their possession but whose title was entered in District Land Offices registers in the Turkish-occupied area. These certificates were prima facie evidence of their right of property. The authorities of the \u201cTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\u201d (the \u201cTRNC\u201d) were in possession of all the records of the Department of Lands and Surveys relating to the title to properties. It was therefore the duty of the respondent Government to produce them.\n23. The Government of Cyprus further noted that the present case was similar to that of Loizidou ((merits), cited above), where the Court had found that the loss of control of property by displaced persons arose as a consequence of the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and the establishment of the \u201cTRNC\u201d, and that the denial of access to property in occupied northern Cyprus constituted a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n#### C. The Court\u2019s assessment\n24. The Court first notes that the documents submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 10 above) provide prima facie evidence that he had a title of ownership over the property at issue. As the respondent Government failed to produce convincing evidence in rebuttal, the Court considers that the applicant had a \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n25. The Court recalls that in the aforementioned Loizidou case ((merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 63-64), it reasoned as follows:\n\u201c63. ... as a consequence of the fact that the applicant has been refused access to the land since 1974, she has effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy, her property. The continuous denial of access must therefore be regarded as an interference with her rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Such an interference cannot, in the exceptional circumstances of the present case to which the applicant and the Cypriot Government have referred, be regarded as either a deprivation of property or a control of use within the meaning of the first and second paragraphs of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, it clearly falls within the meaning of the first sentence of that provision as an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions. In this respect the Court observes that hindrance can amount to a violation of the Convention just like a legal impediment.\n64. Apart from a passing reference to the doctrine of necessity as a justification for the acts of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 and to the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks, the Turkish Government have not sought to make submissions justifying the above interference with the applicant\u2019s property rights which is imputable to Turkey.\nIt has not, however, been explained how the need to rehouse displaced Turkish Cypriot refugees in the years following the Turkish intervention in the island in 1974 could justify the complete negation of the applicant\u2019s property rights in the form of a total and continuous denial of access and a purported expropriation without compensation.\nNor can the fact that property rights were the subject of intercommunal talks involving both communities in Cyprus provide a justification for this situation under the Convention. In such circumstances, the Court concludes that there has been and continues to be a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\u201d\n26. In the case of Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001\u2013IV) the Court confirmed the above conclusions (\u00a7\u00a7 187 and 189):\n\u201c187. The Court is persuaded that both its reasoning and its conclusion in the Loizidou judgment (merits) apply with equal force to displaced Greek Cypriots who, like Mrs Loizidou, are unable to have access to their property in northern Cyprus by reason of the restrictions placed by the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities on their physical access to that property. The continuing and total denial of access to their property is a clear interference with the right of the displaced Greek Cypriots to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n...\n189. .. there has been a continuing violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that Greek-Cypriot owners of property in northern Cyprus are being denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of their property as well as any compensation for the interference with their property rights.\u201d\n27. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the conclusions which it reached in the Loizidou and Cyprus v. Turkey cases (op. cit.; see also Demades v. Turkey (merits), no. 16219/90, \u00a7 46, 31 July 2003).\n28. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 by virtue of the fact that the applicant was denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of his property as well as any compensation for the interference with his property rights.\n### IV. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant submitted that in 1974 he had had his home in Trypimeni village. As he had been unable to return there until his death, he was the victim of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\nThis provision reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n30. The Government disputed this claim, observing that the applicant\u2019s inability to return to northern Cyprus had been an inevitable consequence of the political state of affairs on the island and of the existence of the UN buffer zone. The alleged interference with his rights under Article 8 had therefore been necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, for the prevention of disorder and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n31. The applicant submitted that, contrary to the applicant in the Loizidou case, he had been the owner of a house in Trypimeni village, and that until 1974 he and his family had been using these premises as their home. He claimed that any interference with his Article 8 rights had not been justified under the second paragraph of this provision.\n32. The Court notes that the Government failed to produce any evidence capable of casting doubt upon the applicant\u2019s statement that, at the time of the Turkish invasion, he was regularly residing in Trypimeni village and that this house was treated by the applicant and his family as a home.\n33. Accordingly, the Court considers that in the circumstances of the present case, the house of the applicant qualified as \u201chome\u201d within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention at the time when the acts complained of took place.\n34. The Court observes that the present case differs from the Loizidou case ((merits), cited above) since, unlike Mrs Loizidou, the applicant actually had a home in Trypimeni village.\n35. The Court notes that from 1974 until his death the applicant was unable to gain access to and to use that home. In this connection the Court recalls that, in its judgment in the case of Cyprus v. Turkey (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 172-175), it concluded that the complete denial of the right of Greek\u2011Cypriot displaced persons to respect for their homes in northern Cyprus since 1974 constituted a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention. The Court reasoned as follows:\n\u201c172. The Court observes that the official policy of the \u2018TRNC\u2019 authorities to deny the right of the displaced persons to return to their homes is reinforced by the very tight restrictions operated by the same authorities on visits to the north by Greek Cypriots living in the south. Accordingly, not only are displaced persons unable to apply to the authorities to reoccupy the homes which they left behind, they are physically prevented from even visiting them.\n173. The Court further notes that the situation impugned by the applicant Government has obtained since the events of 1974 in northern Cyprus. It would appear that it has never been reflected in \u2018legislation\u2019 and is enforced as a matter of policy in furtherance of a bi-zonal arrangement designed, it is claimed, to minimise the risk of conflict which the intermingling of the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot communities in the north might engender. That bi-zonal arrangement is being pursued within the framework of the inter-communal talks sponsored by the United Nations Secretary-General ...\n174. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the complete denial of the right of displaced persons to respect for their homes has no basis in law within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (see paragraph 173 above); secondly, the inter-communal talks cannot be invoked in order to legitimate a violation of the Convention; thirdly, the violation at issue has endured as a matter of policy since 1974 and must be considered continuing.\n175. In view of these considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention by reason of the refusal to allow the return of any Greek-Cypriot displaced persons to their homes in northern Cyprus.\u201d\n36. The Court sees no reason in the instant case to depart from the above reasoning and findings (see also Demades (merits), cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37).\n37. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been a continuing violation of Article 8 of the Convention on account of the complete denial of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home.\n### V. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF THE CONVENTION AND OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n38. The applicant complained of a violation of the general obligation to respect human rights enshrined in Article 1 of the Convention. He also complained of a violation under Article 14 of the Convention on account of discriminatory treatment against him in the enjoyment of his rights under Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He alleged that this discrimination had been based on his national origin and religious beliefs.\nThe relevant provisions read as follows:\nArticle 1 of the Convention\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.\u201d\nArticle 14 of the Convention\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n39. The Government disputed these claims.\n40. The Court recalls that in the Alexandrou case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 38-39) it has found that it was not necessary to carry out a separate examination of the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention. The Court does not see any reason to depart from that approach in the present case (see also, mutatis mutandis, Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios v. Turkey, no.16163/90, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38, 31 July 2003). Moreover, the Court has found the respondent Government to be in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and of Article 8 of the Convention and does not consider it necessary to examine the complaint under Article 1, which is a framework provision that cannot be breached on its own (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, \u00a7 238, 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, and Eugenia Michaelidou Ltd and Michael Tymvios, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n### VI. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n41. The applicant submitted that he had not had at his disposal any effective remedy by which to obtain redress for the above-mentioned grievances.\nHe relied on Article 13 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n42. The Government disputed this claim, observing that the \u201ceffective remedy\u201d mentioned in Article 13 necessarily referred to a remedy in the domestic law of the \u201cTRNC\u201d. Turkey could neither interfere with the judicial system of the \u201cTRNC\u201d nor provide remedies to supplement those existing under domestic law.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII, and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST TO STRIKE OUT THE APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 37 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. On 30 July 2007 the Government submitted a unilateral declaration similar to that in the case Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, ECHR 2003-VI) and informed the Court that they were ready to accept that there had been a violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention as a result of the unreasonable length of the proceedings in which the applicant had been involved. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the Government proposed to award the applicant PLN 10,000 (the equivalent of EUR 2,600) in respect of the two cases introduced by the applicant (see paragraphs 4 and 9 above). The Government invited the Court to strike out the applications in accordance with Article 37 of the Convention.\n12. The applicant did not agree with the Government\u2019s proposal and requested the Court to continue the examination of the cases. He maintained that the amount offered was too low.\n13. The Court observes that, as it has already held on many occasions, it may be appropriate under certain circumstances to strike out an application under Article 37 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention on the basis of a unilateral declaration by the respondent Government even if the applicant wishes the examination of the case to be continued. It will depend on the particular circumstances whether the unilateral declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require the Court to continue its examination of the case (see Tahsin Acar, cited above, \u00a7 75; and Melnic v. Moldova, no. 6923/03, \u00a7 22, 14 November 2006).\n14. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the amount proposed in a unilateral declaration may be considered a sufficient basis for striking out an application or part thereof. The Court will have regard in this connection to the compatibility of the amount with its own awards in similar length of proceedings cases, bearing in mind the principles which it has developed for determining victim status and for assessing the amount of non-pecuniary compensation to be awarded where it has found a breach of the reasonable-time requirement (see Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 85\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011...,; Scordino v. Italy (no.1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 193-215, ECHR-2006-...; and Dubjakova v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 10 October 2004).\n15. It is to be noted that the amount proposed by the Government in their unilateral declaration refers to two separate cases brought by the applicant, one of which is the subject of the present proceedings.\n16. While the amount proposed might be considered sufficient in a single case, it cannot be accepted as adequate just satisfaction for a breach of the reasonable-time requirement in two separate cases. On the facts and for the reasons set out above, in particular the amount of compensation proposed, the Court finds that the Government have failed to provide a sufficient basis for concluding that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols does not require it to continue its examination of the case (see, a contrario, Sp\u00f3\u0142ka z o.o. WAZA v. Poland (striking out), no. 11602/02, 26 June 2007).\n17. This being so, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s request to strike the application out of its list of cases under Article 37 of the Convention and will accordingly pursue its examination of the admissibility and merits of the case.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government refrained from submitting observations on the admissibility and merits of the complaint.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration began on 25 October 1999 and ended on 27 October 2004. It thus lasted 5 years and 4 days for one level of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. In the present case the Regional Court acknowledged a breach of the applicant\u2019s right to a hearing within a reasonable time but refrained from making an award of just satisfaction (see paragraph 8 above). Having regard to the criteria for determining victim status in respect of length of proceedings complaints as set out in the above-mentioned Scordino (no. 1) judgment, the Court concludes that the complaint cannot be rejected as being incompatible ratione personae with the Convention.\nIt further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n22. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many ot", "001-94421": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ERKU\u015e v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n15. Article 72 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Law on Military Service stipulate that every male citizen of the Republic of Turkey shall fulfil his military service.\n16. Pursuant to section 80 \u00a7 1 of the Law on Military Service, those who have deserted their headquarters or who have exceeded their period of leave or medical leave shall be searched for, arrested and placed in the custody of the local military authorities in order to be handed over to their army commands.\n17. Section 66 of the Military Criminal Code is entitled \u201cdesertion\u201d. Paragraph 1 (b) of this provision makes it a criminal offence to exceed one\u2019s period of leave by six days without authorisation.\n18. Under section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure applicable at the time of the events, the period a person can spend in custody shall not exceed forty-eight hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court. Under section 80 \u00a7 5, if the arrestee cannot be brought before a military court within the time-limit specified in section 80 \u00a7 3, he or she shall be taken to the nearest magistrates\u2019 court. No one shall be deprived of his or her liberty beyond this time-limit.\n19. On 29 June 2006 section 80 \u00a7 3 of the Law on the Constitution of Military Courts and Criminal Procedure was amended by Law no. 5530, which provided that time in custody shall not exceed twenty-four hours, excluding the time necessary to transfer the detainee to the nearest military court, and that the time necessary for transfer could not be more than twelve hours.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that his detention had been unlawful and excessively long and that the authorities had failed to initiate an investigation into the matter. He relied on Articles 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 and 13 of the Convention.\n22. The Court considers that these complaints should be examined solely from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 (b), (c) and 3, which provide as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...\n(b) the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non- compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\n3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n23. The Government maintained that the applicant had not been deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. In this connection, they submitted that he had been kept under surveillance in the Izmir Military Recruitment Office for the sole purpose of ensuring his transfer back to his army command and that he was not subjected to any proceedings or investigation until he was taken to his military unit. They further claimed that this administrative measure had been taken to prevent his escape, since he was a deserter, and that he had immediately been sent to his unit upon the completion of necessary procedures such as the provision of a vehicle, personnel, travel expenses and monetary matters concerning his transfer. Moreover, the Government claimed that the applicant had actually been in military service during that time. The Government admitted that the applicant had been held in custody between 7 and 11 March 2003 for the proper administration of military discipline. They submitted that he had been brought before a judge on the very day the Military Prosecutor filed an indictment.\n24. The applicant maintained that he had been held in custody from 22 February 2003 until 11 March 2003, first in Izmir and afterwards in K\u0131rklareli. He further disputed the qualification given by the Government to his detention, noting that it had deprived him of his liberty and restricted his rights to see his lawyer and family. He claimed that the conditions of his detention had been inhuman as he had been threatened, beaten and given food only once a day. Finally, the applicant repeated that, despite the unlawfulness of his detention, the authorities had failed to investigate the matter.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Whether there was deprivation of applicant\u2019s liberty\n25. The Court observes that there is no dispute between the parties as regards the applicant\u2019s detention between 7 March and 11 March 2003 in K\u0131rklareli. However, the Government argued that the applicant was not deprived of his liberty between 22 February 2003 and 7 March 2003 in Izmir.\n26. The Court reiterates that military service, as encountered in the Contracting States, does not of itself constitute a deprivation of liberty under the Convention, since it is expressly sanctioned in Article 4 \u00a7 3 (b). In addition, rather wide limitations upon the freedom of movement of members of the armed forces ensue by reason of the specific demands of military service, so that the normal restrictions accompanying it do not come within the ambit of Article 5 either (see Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, 8 June 1976, \u00a7 59, Series A no. 22). However, the forms of restriction which clearly deviate from the normal conditions of life in the armed forces of the Contracting States fall within the scope of Article 5. In order to establish whether this is so, account should be taken of a whole range of factors such as the nature, duration, effects and manner of execution of the penalty or measure in question (ibid).\n27. In the instant case, the Court observes that on 22 February 2003 the applicant was detained in custody at the \u015eirinyer Military Station Command. Between 23 February 2003 and 6 March 2003 the applicant was kept in a \u201csecurity room\u201d at the Izmir Military Recruitment Office. The Court further observes that these periods were subsequently deducted from the applicant\u2019s prison sentence (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, the Government have not provided any explanation or details as regards what security or other measures were applicable to the applicant and, apart from the statement that he was in military service, no evidence has been adduced to demonstrate that he remained, more or less, within the ordinary framework of his army life during that time. In view of the above, the Court considers that the applicant was also deprived of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention when he was held in Izmir between 22 February 2003 and 6 March 2003.\n##### 2. Whether the deprivation in issue was \u201clawful\u201d\n28. The Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention contains a list of permissible grounds of deprivation of liberty which is exhaustive. The applicability of one ground does not necessarily preclude that of another; a detention may, depending on the circumstances, be justified under more than one sub-paragraph (see, for example, Erkalo v. the Netherlands, 2 September 1998, \u00a7 50, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VI). However, only a narrow interpretation of those exceptions is consistent with the aim of that provision, namely to ensure that no one is arbitrarily deprived of his or her liberty (see, inter alia, Giulia Manzoni v. It", "001-82750": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF PI\u0104TKIEWICZ v.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 September 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS FOR PAYMENT\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings for payment had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 May 1991. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 16 December 1999. It thus lasted 6 years, 7 months and 17 days for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government raised a preliminary objection that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies available to him under Polish law, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They maintained that from 17 September 2004, the date of entry into force of the 2004 Act, the applicant had a possibility of seeking compensation for damage resulting from the excessive length of proceedings before the Polish courts, under section 16 of the 2004 Act read in conjunction with Article 417 of the Civil Code. Moreover, the applicant had lodged such a civil claim which had been examined on the merits at two instances and is pending before the Supreme Court.\n22. The applicant contested that argument and submitted that he had exhausted all available domestic remedies. In addition he argued that a claim for compensation under Article 417 of the Civil Code was not an effective remedy; nevertheless, he had attempted to make use of it, to no avail.\n23. The Court has already examined whether after 18 December 2001 and prior to the entry into force of the 2004 Act a compensation claim in tort as provided for by Polish civil law was an effective remedy in respect of complaints about the length of proceedings. It held that no persuasive arguments had been adduced to show that Article 417 of the Civil Code could at that time be relied on for the purpose of seeking compensation for excessive length of proceedings or that such action offered reasonable prospects of success (see Skawi\u0144ska v Poland (dec.), no. 42096/98, 4 March 2003, and Malasiewicz v. Poland, no. 22072/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-34, 14 October 2003). Subsequently, and following the entry into force of the 2004 Act, the Court has held that the civil action relied on by the Government cannot be regarded as an effective remedy with a sufficient degree of certainty in cases where the three-year limitation period for the State's liability in tort expired before the entry into force of the 2004 Act on 17 September 2004 (see Ratajczyk v. Poland, cited above; and Barszcz v. Poland, no. 71152/01, \u00a7 45, 30 May 2006, Drabicki v. Poland, no. 15464/02, \u00a7 17, 14 November 2006).\nThe present case belongs to this group of applications as the proceedings at issue ended on 16 December 1999, which is more than three years before the 2004 Act came into force. The Court reiterates that the only remedies which Article 35 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. In view of the above findings, and since the applicant's attempt to obtain redress at the national level by making use of a remedy that is not regarded by the Court as effective in similar cases, the Court considers that the Government's plea of inadmissibility on the ground of non\u2011exhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed.\n24. The Government further submitted that the applicant had withheld information from the Court as he had failed to inform it that he had lodged civil proceedings for compensation under Article 417 of the Civil Code. Thus, his application to the Court constituted an abuse of the right of individual application under Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n25. The applicant did not comment on the Government's objection.\n26. The Court observes that the applicant in his letter of 15 November 2004 did inform the Registry of the Court about his intention to make use of the remedies introduced by the 2004 Act. In view of this, and given the general nature of the Government's argument, the Court finds no grounds whatsoever for concluding that the applicant's application to the Court is an abuse of the right of individual application.\n27. The Court further notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII). The Court reiterates that special diligence is necessary in employment disputes (Ruotolo v. Italy, judgment of 27 February 199", "001-79415": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF AKINTI AND OTHERS v.

The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002), Gen\u00e7el v.

By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Journal on 30 June 2004, the State Security Courts have been abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n1. As regards the independence and impartiality of the Istanbul State Security Court\n21. The applicants complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that they had been denied a fair hearing on account of a military judge on the bench of the Istanbul State Security Court which had tried and convicted them.\nThe relevant parts of Article 6 provide as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n22. The Government submitted that there was no basis to find that the applicants could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Istanbul State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 18 June 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34; \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35\u201136, 6 February 2003; and Han v. Turkey, no. 50997/99, \u00a7\u00a7 23-24, 13 September 2005).\n24. The Court sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. It is understandable that the applicants, who were prosecuted in a State Security Court for aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, they could legitimately fear that the Istanbul State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicants' fear as to the State Security Court's lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV, \u00a7 72).\n25. In the light of the foregoing the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect.\n##### 2. As regards the other complaints submitted under Article 6 of the Convention\n26. The applicants maintained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the search in the HADEP Gaziosmanpa\u015fa office had not been conducted in accordance with law and since their conviction by the State Security Court had been based on the evidence found there, they did not have a fair trial. The applicants complained under Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) of the Convention that the submissions of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court on the merits of the case and the written opinion of the public prosecutor at the Cou", "001-93654": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF JANUS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Preventive measures, including pre-trial detention\n16. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Go\u0142ek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, \u00a7\u00a7 27-33, 25 April 2006, and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22-23, 4 August 2006.\n17. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the censorship of correspondence is stated in the Court\u2019s in the cases of Matwiejczuk v. Poland, no 37641/97, 2 December 2003, and Drozdowski v. Poland, no. 20841/02, 6 December 2005.\n#### B. Relevant statistical data\n18. In the framework of the procedure before the Committee of Ministers (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below) the Polish Government supplied statistical data concerning the number and the length of pre-trial detentions ordered in the years 2005-2006 by the domestic courts. A more detailed rendition of the relevant statistical data can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Kauczor (see Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, \u00a7 28, 3 February 2009).\n### III. MEASURES TAKEN BY THE STATE TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF PRE-TRIAL DETENTION\n#### A. Recent amendments to the relevant legislation\n19. A number of amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego), designed to streamline criminal proceedings, entered into force on 20 June 2007 (Law of 9 May 2007 on amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure; Journal of Laws of 2007, No. 99, item 664; Ustawa o zmianie ustawy - Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego oraz niekt\u00f3rych innych ustaw). Those amendments strengthened the powers of the authorities to discipline the parties. A more detailed rendition of the recent amendments to the legislation can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 27 and 30-31).\n#### B. Other measures\n20. According to the information supplied by the Polish Government to the Committee of Ministers (see paragraph 23 below), in addition the Polish trial courts and prosecution authorities have undertaken a series of practical measures in order to organise criminal proceedings in a more efficient manner, i.e. by scheduling time-limits for hearings well in advance, holding hearings on Saturdays or severing charges against co-accused to separate proceedings under Article 34 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if the joint examination proves difficult and time-consuming.\n21. On 17 May 2007 the Cabinet (Rada Ministr\u00f3w) adopted the \u201cPlan of Actions of the Government for the execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in respect of Poland\u201d (Program Dzia\u0142a\u0144 Rzqdu w sprawie wykonywania wyrok\u00f3w Europejskiego Trybuna\u0142u Praw Cz\u0142owieka). By virtue of that document the Minister of Justice was obliged to disseminate among judges and prosecutors on a regular basis information on the standards concerning the length of pre-trial detention stemming from the Convention and the case-law of the Court in Polish cases and to include this topic in the programmes of workshops and seminars for judges.\n### IV. RELEVANT COUNCIL OF EUROPE DOCUMENTS\n#### A. The Committee of Ministers\n22. On 6 June 2007 the Committee of Ministers adopted an Interim Resolution concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in 44 cases against Poland relating to the excessive length of detention on remand (\u201cthe 2007 Resolution\u201d). It concluded that the number of the Court\u2019s judgments finding Poland in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention on account of the length of pre-trial detention revealed a structural problem. A more detailed rendition of the 2007 Resolution can be found in the Court\u2019s judgment given in the case of Kauczor v. Poland (see Kauczor, cited above, \u00a7 34)\n#### B. The Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights\n23. On 20 June 2007 the Council of Europe\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights released the Memorandum to the Polish Government concerning, among other issues, the use of the pre-trial detention in Poland. The Commissioner referred to the fact that the Court had repeatedly found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 in respect of Poland and stressed that examples of cases brought to the Court where pre-trial detention had lasted between 4 to 6 years were not uncommon. The Commissioner urged the Polish authorities to review the application and functioning of pre-trial detention in Polish law. A more detailed rendition of the relevant parts of the memorandum can be found in the above-mentioned Kauczor judgment (see Kauczor v. Poland, cited above, \u00a7 35).\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n24. The Court notes at the outset that the applicant died after the introduction of his application. Subsequently, his mother, Mrs Stefania Janus, informed the Court that she wished to pursue the application introduced by her son. She explained that her son had lived with her in her apartment until his death. She had taken care of him since he had suffered from nervous depression after his stay in detention facilities. She also supported him financially as he had lost his job, home and wife after his arrest. She submitted that her son had needed continual care until his death. Therefore, she had suffered frustration and distress caused, in particular, by her son\u2019s almost three\u2011year\u2011long detention on remand and its consequences.\n25. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s mother cannot be considered a person entitled to pursue the proceedings before the Court on the applicant\u2019s behalf and invited the Court to strike the application out of its list of cases.\n26. The Court recalls that when an applicant dies during the proceedings, the next\u2011of\u2011kin of the applicant has a legitimate interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case (see, for example, Lukanov v. Bulgaria, 20 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997\u2011II, \u00a7 35; Fojcik v. Poland, no. 57670/00, \u00a7 46, 21 September 2004; X v. France, 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234-C, p. 89, \u00a7 26 and Kozimor v. Poland, no. 10816/02, \u00a7\u00a7 25-29, 12 April 2007).\n27. The Court thus accepts that the applicant\u2019s mother has a legitimate moral interest to pursue the application on his son\u2019s behalf and to obtain a ruling whether, in particular, the length of his detention and alleged censorship of his correspondence had infringed his Convention rights, complaints which he relied on before the Court.\n28. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s mother has standing to continue the proceedings before the Court in the applicant\u2019s stead, and the Government\u2019s preliminary objection should be dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that the length of his detention on remand had been excessive. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n30. The Government contested that argument.\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n31. The applicant\u2019s detention started on 12 September 2001, when he was arrested on suspicion of murder. On 22 March 2002 the S\u0142upsk Regional Court convicted him of murder as charged.\nAs from that date he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and, consequently, that period of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (cf. Kud\u0142a, cited above, \u00a7 104).\nOn 5 September 2002 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction. Following that date his detention was again covered by Article 5 \u00a7 3. It continued until 16 September 2003 when the applicant was again convicted. On 10 February 2004 the Gda\u0144sk Court of Appeal again quashed the applicant\u2019s conviction. Following that date his detention was again covered by Article 5 \u00a7 3. It continued until 7 February 2005 when the applicant was again convicted.\n32. Accordingly, the period to be taken into consideration amounts to two years, six months and seventeen days.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n(a) General principles\n33. The Court recalls that the general principles regarding the right \u201cto trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial, as guaranteed by Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention were stated in a number of its previous judgments (see, among many other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110 et seq, ECHR 2000\u2011XI; and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7\u00a7 41-44, ECHR 2006-..., with further references).\n(b) Application of the above principles in the present case\n34. In their detention decisions the authorities relied principally on two grounds, namely on the reasonable suspicion against the applicant and the severity of the penalty to which he was liable.\n35. The Court accepts that the reasonable suspicion against the applicant of having committed a serious offence could initially warrant his detention.\n36. However, with the passage of time, those grounds became less and less relevant. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds adduced by the courts \u2013 namely, the severity of the anticipated sentence \u2013 was \u201csufficient\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d (see, Kud\u0142a cited above, \u00a7 111).\n37. According to the authorities, the likelihood of a severe sentence being imposed on the applicant created a presumption that the applicant would obstruct the proceedings. However, the Court would reiterate that, while the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending, the gravity of the charges cannot by itself justify long periods of detention on remand (see Michta v. Poland, no. 13425/02, \u00a7\u00a7 49, 4 May 2006).\n38. Having regard to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant lasted almost four years and that the case was heard three times by the first-instance court, it is questionable whether those grounds could be considered \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d throughout the entire period and whether the authorities showed the necessary diligence in dealing with the case (see, among other authorities, Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000\u2011IV).\n39. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the grounds given by the domestic authorities could not justify the overall period of the applicant\u2019s detention. In these circumstances it is not necessary to examine whether the proceedings were conducted with special diligence.\nThere has accordingly been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n40. The Court considered it appropriate to raise ex officio the issue of Poland\u2019s compliance with Article 8 of the Convention on account of the monitoring of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with the Court.\nThis Article, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his ... correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\nThe Government\u2019s plea of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\n41. The Government submitted that the applicant had not exhausted all available domestic remedies. They alleged that he had failed to bring an action under Articles 24 and 23 in conjunction with Article 448 of the Civil Code. These provisions would have allowed the applicant to assert that by censoring his correspondence the authorities had breached his personal rights protected by the Civil Code and to claim compensation for non-pecuniary damage.\n42. In this connection, the Government relied on the Warsaw Regional Court\u2019s judgment of 27 November 2006 in which a prisoner had been awarded 5,000 Polish zlotys in damages from the State Treasury for a breach of the confidentiality of his correspondence with the Central Board of the Prison Service and the Central Electoral Office. The Regional Court had held that the confidentiality of one\u2019s correspondence was one of th", "001-77991": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OSUCH v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Osuch v. Poland,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nSir Nicolas Bratza, President,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr K. Traja,\nMr S. Pavlovschi,\nMr L. Garlicki,\nMs L. Mijovi\u0107, judges,\nand Mrs F. Elens-Passos, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 October 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nThe relevant provisions of the domestic law relating to preventive measures are set out in several judgments (see, among others, Jaworski v. Poland, no. 25715/02, \u00a7\u00a7 20-27, 28 March 2006).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and under Article 3 of the Convention that the length of his pre-trial detention was excessive. The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Period to be taken into consideration\n17. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention lasted from 10 March 1999 to 16 January 2002, when the first-instance judgment was given. Accordingly, the period of his detention amounts to approximately 2 years and 10 months.\n##### 2. The reasonableness of the length of detention\n(a) The parties\u2019 arguments\n18. The Government maintained that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention was not excessive. They stated that there were relevant and sufficient grounds for justifying his detention during the entire period at issue. It was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings, especially in view of the gravity of the charges and the severe penalty that could be expected. The Government drew attention to the fact that the applicant had been charged with membership of an organised criminal group. There was therefore a serious risk that, if released, he would attempt to put pressure on witnesses or obstruct the proceedings.\n19. The Government argued that the domestic authorities showed due diligence when dealing with the case. They stressed that it was an extremely complex one as it concerned organised crime. They further maintained that all the applicant\u2019s requests for release and appeals against decisions prolonging his detention were thoroughly examined by the competent courts.\n20. The applicant contested these arguments. He submitted that his detention had been inordinately lengthy.\n(b) The Court\u2019s assessment\n(i) Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n21. The Court reiterates that the question whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in the abstract but must be considered in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty laid down in Article 5 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 110-111, ECHR 2000-X).\n22. Under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the national judicial authorities must ensure that the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must, paying due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, examine all the facts arguing for a departure from the rule in Article 5 and must set them out in their decisions on the applications for release.\n23. The persistence of reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. The Court must then establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also be satisfied that the national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see, for instance, Jab\u0142o\u0144ski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000).\n(ii) Application of the principles to the circumstances of the present case\n24. The Court observes that in their decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention the judicial authorities relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, their serious nature and the heavy penalty which could be expected. They also referred to the risk that the applicant, if released, might obstruct the proper conduct of the trial or induce witnesses to give false testimony. They repeated those grounds in nearly all the decisions concerning the applicant\u2019s detention (see paragraphs 6-8 and 10 above).\n25. The Court agrees that the strong suspicion against the applicant o", "001-94000": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF ETEM KARAG\u00d6Z v.

Turkey,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nFran\u00e7oise Tulkens, President,\nIreneu Cabral Barreto,\nVladimiro Zagrebelsky,\nDanut\u0117 Jo\u010dien\u0117,\nAndr\u00e1s Saj\u00f3,\nNona Tsotsoria,\nI\u015f\u0131l Karaka\u015f, judges,\nand Sally Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 August 2009,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n12. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that the length of his detention on remand had been excessive. He further contended under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention that there were no remedies in domestic law to challenge the length of his detention on remand.\n13. The Court observes that the applicant\u2019s detention, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, began when he was taken into police custody on 19 January 1994 and continued until he was convicted by the trial court on 30 July 1997. From 30 July 1997 until his conviction was quashed by the Court of Cassation on 1 March 1999, he was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) and therefore that period of his detention falls outside the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 3 (see Cahit Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 34623/03, \u00a7 34, 14 June 2007 and the cases cited therein). From 1 March 1999 until his conviction by the trial court again on 9 March 2007, however, the applicant was once more in pre-trial detention for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It follows that the applicant spent a total of over eleven years and six months as a remand prisoner.\n#### A. Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n14. The Government argued that there had been a genuine requirement of public interest for the continued detention of the applicant, who had been charged with a serious offence. There had also been a high risk of him escaping and committing further crimes.\n15. The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds. They must therefore be declared admissible.\n16. The Court observes that the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court failed to indicate to what extent the applicant\u2019s release would have posed a risk, after \u2013 by then \u2013 well over eleven years of detention (including the periods of imprisonment after conviction), in its last decision to extend the applicant\u2019s detention pending his trial at first instance. Neither are there any documents in the file to suggest that the trial court, which ordered the applicant\u2019s continued detention on many occasions, at any time displayed concern about the length of the applicant\u2019s detention.\n17. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, \u00a7\u00a7 18-24, 2 February 2006; Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, \u00a7 44, 16 January 2007; G\u00fcve\u00e7 v. Turkey, no. 70337/01, \u00a7 108, 20 January 2009).\n18. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or convincing argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant\u2019s detention pending trial was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n19. There has accordingly been a violation of this provision.\n#### B. Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention\n20. The Government submitted that the applicant had challenged his detention period before the trial court, which indicated that an effective remedy had been available. Alternatively, if the applicant had believed that the domestic remedies were ineffective, then he should have lodged his application with the Court within six months of the detention order.\n21. The Court has already examined the possibility of challenging the lawfulness of pre-trial detention in Turkey at the relevant time and concluded that it offered little prospect of success in practice as it did not provide for a procedure that was genuinely adversarial for the accused (see Do\u011fan Yal\u00e7\u0131n v. Turkey, no. 15041/03, \u00a7 43, 19 February 2008). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its previous findings. Additionally the Court observes that the applicant challenged his detention, albeit unsuccessfully, on 20 October 2005, whereas the present application was introduced beforehand, on 18 August 2005. The Government\u2019s objection concerning compliance with the six-month rule under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is not, therefore, pertinent.\n22. In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there has been a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n23.

It may be subject to editorial revision.]\nIn the case of Dickson v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Former Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving regard to the observations of the parties,\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 4 April 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Prison Rules\n13. The Secretary of State is empowered to make rules for the management of prisons by Section 47 of the Prison Act, 1952, which, in so far as material, provides as follows:\n\u201cThe Secretary of State may make rules for the regulation and management of prisons... and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein...\u201d\n14. The relevant rules are the Prison Rules 1999 (SI 1999 No 728). Rule 4 provides as follows:\n\u201cOutside Contacts\n(1) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both.\n(2) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may, in the opinion of the governor, best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation.\u201d\n#### B. R (Mellor) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] 3 WLR 533\n15. The long standing policy of the prison service, set out above in the letter of Secretary of State of 28 May 2003 was challenged by a Mr Mellor, a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder. He was 29 years of age at the time his case came before the Court of Appeal with a minimum of 3 years\u2019 imprisonment to serve. His wife was 25 of age. At his earliest release she would have been 28. He and his wife had been refused artificial insemination facilities: it was considered that there was nothing exceptional about their case.\n16. They challenged the policy rather than its application to their case arguing that it was an unjustified interference with their Article 8 rights. They distinguished that policy from the policy on conjugal visits: the latter gave rise to pragmatic (security) concerns whereas artificial insemination did not. The Government argued that the policy was justified: (a) it was an explicit consequence of imprisonment that prisoners should not have the opportunity to found a family; (b) there would likely be serious and justified public concern if prisoners continued to have the opportunity to conceive children while in prison; and (c) it was undesirable, as a general rule, for children to be brought up in single parent families.\n17. The Court of Appeal considered, while the first reason did no more than restate the policy, the second and third reasons were legitimate justifications for the policy. In giving judgment for the court, Lord Phillips said (at paragraphs 44 ff):\n\u201c[The Secretary of State] submitted that this passage demonstrated that public perception was a legitimate element of penal policy. I agree. Penal sanctions are imposed, in part, to exact retribution for wrongdoing. If there were no system of penal sanctions, members of the public would be likely to take the law into their own hands. In my judgment it is legitimate to have regard to public perception when considering the characteristics of a penal system.\nFurthermore, [the applicants\u2019] submissions did not recognise the significance of the word \u201cjustified\u201d in the phrase \u201cjustified public concern\u201d. A policy which accorded to prisoners in general the right to beget children by artificial insemination would, I believe, raise difficult ethical questions and give rise to legitimate public concern...\n... [the applicants] submitted that [the disadvantage of single parent families] was not a material consideration when formulating prison policy... Again, I do not agree. By imprisoning the husband the State creates the situation where, if the wife is to have a child, that child will, until the husband\u2019s release, be brought up in a single parent family. I consider it legitimate, and indeed desirable, that the State should consider the implications of children being brought up in those circumstances when deciding whether or not to have a general policy of facilitating the artificial insemination of the wives of prisoners or of wives who are themselves prisoners.\nFor those reasons [the applicants have] failed to make out his case that the Secretary of State\u2019s policy only to facilitate artificial insemination in exceptional circumstances is irrational. [The applicants] accepted that there were in this case no exceptional circumstances, and [they were] right to do so.\u201d\n18. For those reasons the court concluded that the policy was not a disproportionate interference with the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 8. Lord Phillips remarked that, for any applicant claiming exceptional circumstances, the normal \u201cstarting point\u201d should be the need to demonstrate that, if facilities for artificial insemination were not provided, conception would not just be delayed but prevented altogether.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicants complained about the refusal of access to artificial insemination facilities and argued that that refusal breached their right to respect for private and family life under Article 8. That Article, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, ... .\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n20. They maintained that the aim of the restriction had to be punishment (as there was no security or other physical or financial barrier) but that, if that was the objective, it would be incoherent to admit of any exceptions to this punitive policy.\n21. In any event, it required considerable justification to take away a fundamental right. Indeed, the starting point of the policy was all wrong: it should be that they had a right to conceive children unless there were compelling reasons against. The applicants relied on the Chamber\u2019s judgment in Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) (no. 74025/01, \u00a7\u00a7 41 and 44, ECHR 2004 ...). They maintained that the social factors (the interests of the putative child and of society) underlying the policy and the response to their request by the Secretary of State were not factors contemplated by the second paragraph of Article 8 of the Convention.\n22. In any event, there were insufficient reasons to justify the impugned restriction. A request for artificial insemination did not pose a threat to security. There was no rational link between the offence and the punishment: a person convicted of offences against children could coherently be deprived of parental rights whereas the refusal of the requested facilities indiscriminately (except in exceptional cases) was unjustifiable.\n23. As to the application of the policy in their case, the applicants underlined that a refusal of artificial insemination to them meant that their right to found a family would be extinguished: they could not have a child together given the second applicant\u2019s age, the accepted point of departure for the consideration of a request for artificial insemination. Even if it could be said that the first applicant forfeited some of his rights when he was imprisoned, the same could not be said of the second applicant, a point with which the Court of Appeal and the Government failed to grapple. They disputed the Secretary of State\u2019s conclusion that there was insufficient financial provision: the second applicant owned a property worth 200,000 pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d), she was following a course in counselling and, on qualification, she would be able to command an hourly rate of 30 GBP. It was unfair to state that their relationship had not been tested: the strength of any relationship (prisoner or other) was uncertain, there was no link between imprisonment and dissolution of relationship and, indeed, the first applicant\u2019s imprisonment had not weakened their relationship. In any event, this latter argument was circuitous as it could automatically negate any request for artificial insemination from long term prisoners such as the first applicant. It was equally unjust and circular to argue that the first applicant would be initially absent: it was absence for the foreseeable future that rendered the request for artificial insemination necessary \u2013 if the first applicant was to have been shortly released, he would not have needed to make the request.\n24. The Government submitted that the restriction was a punishment the consequences of which were not disproportionate to the aim of maintaining a penal system designed to punish and deter.\nThe policy was consistent with relevant Convention case-law namely, five Commission decisions (No. 6564/74, Dec. 21.5.75, 2 Decision and Reports (\u201cDR\u201d), p. 105; No. 8166/78, Dec. 3.10.78, 13 DR, p. 241; Hamer v. the United Kingdom, no. 7114/75, Commission report of 13 December 1979, 24 DR, p. 5; Draper v. the United Kingdom, no. 8186/78, Commission report of 10 July 1980, 24 DR, p. 72; and ELH and PBH v. the United Kingdom, nos. 32094/96 and 32568/96, Commission decision of 22 October 1997, 91A DR, p. 61). The Court of Appeal in the above-cited Mellor case accurately summarised that case-law as containing five principles: the qualifications on the right to respect for family life applied equally to Article 12; imprisonment was incompatible with the exercise of conjugal rights and consequently involved an interference with the right to respect for family life; this restriction was ordinarily justifiable under the provisions of Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention; in exceptional circumstances it might be necessary to relax the imposition of detention in order to avoid a disproportionate interference with a particular human right; and there was no Convention jurisprudence which indicated that a prisoner was entitled to assert the right to found a family by artificial insemination. The approach of the Court of Appeal, as noted in the Mellor and the present case, was identical to that of the Convention organs.\nThe Government further maintained that the policy was consistent with the Convention because it enabled examination of the individual merits of each case. Its justification was to be found in three principles: losing the opportunity to beget children was one of the ordinary consequences of imprisonment; public confidence in the operation of the prison system would be undermined if prisoners could continue to conceive children while serving long sentences for serious offences; and the inevitable absence of one parent for a long period would have negative consequences for the child and for society as a whole. Accordingly, the normal starting point was that artificial insemination facilities would not be granted unless their refusal would prevent the founding of a family altogether. Thereafter, the authorities would take into account other relevant factors such as raising a child in the absence of a father, the stability of the relationship and public concern.\nAs to the application of the policy in the present case, the Government noted that the fact that the applicants would not be able to conceive children naturally was overcome by the other reasons relied upon by the Secretary of State.\nFinally, the Government maintained that they should be afforded a wide margin of appreciation, the case involving as it did a claim that the State should take positive action to promote Convention rights in an area of social policy where difficult choices had to be made between the rights of an individual and the needs of society. They noted that there did not appear to be any European consensus in favour of the provision of facilities for artificial insemination of prisoners.\nThe applicants, in response, argued that the jurisprudence cited by the Government was unreliable: it was Commission jurisprudence, it was old and therefore not indicative of current evolutions and trends and it was not, in any event, directly on point. The matter was therefore free of precedent. They would pay for the requested facilities themselves, so there would be no financial burden. The Government had failed to develop or explain why not being able to beget children should be necessarily part of the punishment of imprisonment. It was a policy that discriminated against the first applicant vis-\u00e0-vis a life sentence prisoner who had been allowed into open conditions with trips home. The applicants also contended that moral considerations were not a matter for the Government when considering the effectiveness of human rights. The Government contested that argument.\n#### B. Admissibility\n25. Having regard to the parties\u2019 submissions, the Court considers that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### C. Merits\n26. It is well established that prisoners do not forfeit their Convention rights following conviction and sentence and continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Convention save for the right to liberty: those rights include the right to continue to enjoy respect for family and private life (Hirst v. the United Kingdom (no. 2) [GC], no. 74025/01, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2005 ... citing, inter alia, Ploski v. Poland, no. 26761/95, judgment of 12 November 2002). As to the present case, artificial insemination relates to the applicants\u2019 private and family life in such a way that the question of their access thereto falls within the ambit of Article 8 (the above-cited cases of E.L.H. and P.B.H v. the United Kingdom, Kalashnikov v. Russia (dec.), no. 47095/99, ECHR 2001-XI and Aliev v. Ukraine, no. 41220/98, \u00a7 187-189, 29 April 2003.\n27. It nevertheless remains the case that any measure depriving a prisoner of liberty by definition has some effect on the normal incidents of liberty and inevitably entails limitations and controls on the exercise of Convention rights, including a measure of control on prisoners\u2019 contacts with the outside world and, more particularly for present purposes, on the possibility of begetting a child. The fact of such control is not, in principle, incompatible with the Convention (Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, \u00a7 98; the above-cited decision in Kalashnikov v. Russia; Klamecki v. Poland (no. 2), no. 31583/96, \u00a7 144, 3 April 2003; and Aliev v. Ukraine, cited above, at \u00a7 187). The key issue is whether the nature and extent of that control can be considered compatible with the Convention.\n28. The first step in any such assessment is to identify whether the impugned restriction constitutes an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to respect for their private and family lives (the State\u2019s negative obligations) or a failure by the State to fulfil a positive obligation in those respects.\n29. The Court accepts that the boundaries between the State\u2019s positive and negative obligations under Article 8 do not lend themselves to precise definition (Selmani v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 70258/01, ECHR 2001 VII). It has indeed previously classified certain restrictions on the exercise of contact rights of prisoners as interferences as regards, inter alia, ordinary visits (Messina v. Italy (no. 2), no. 25498/94, ECHR 2000 X), conjugal visits (the above-cited Aliev case) and attending funerals (the above-cited Ploski case).\n30. However, in the present case, the Court considers that the impugned restriction does not limit a general entitlement already in place in a prison environment (for example, controlling the mechanics of contact with family and visits) but rather concerns the State\u2019s refusal to take steps exceptionally to allow something (the possibility of the begetting of children by prisoners) not already an existing general right or entitlement. The Court considers therefore that the applicants effectively complained that, in refusing access to artificial insemination facilities, the State failed to fulfil a positive obligation to secure respect for private or family life.\n31. The requirements of the notion of \u201crespect\u201d for private and family life in Article 8 are not clear-cut, especially as far as the positive obligations inherent in that concept are concerned, and vary considerably from case to case having regard, notably, to the diversity of situations obtaining in Contracting States and the choices which must be made in terms of the State\u2019s priorities and resources. These considerations are particularly relevant in the present case. The issues raised by the case touch on an area where there is little common ground amongst the member States of the Council of Europe. The present applicants did not suggest that there was any European consensus in favour of granting artificial insemination facilities to prisoners and indeed were unable to point to any other Contracting State which affords prisoners access to such facilities. Nor can the Court discern in this regard any \u201cevolving convergence as to the standards to be achieved\u201d (Christine Goodwin v. the United Kingdom [GC], no.28957/95, \u00a7 74, ECHR 2002 VI). It is true that it appears that more than half the Contracting States allow for conjugal visits for prisoners, subject to a variety of different restrictions, a measure which may be seen as obviating the need for the authorities to provide in addition facilities for artificial insemination. However, the Court notes that, while it has expressed its approval for the movement in several European countries to grant conjugal visits, it has not yet interpreted the Convention as requiring Contracting States to make provision for such visits (see the above-cited Aliev judgment, at \u00a7 188). Accordingly, this is an area in which the Contracting States enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in determining the steps to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention with due regard to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals.\n32. In determining the existence and scope of any positive obligation, regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual, the search for which is inherent throughout the Convention. The aims mentioned in the second paragraph of Article 8 \u201cmay\u201d have \u201ca certain relevance\u201d only. Moreover, any such obligation must not be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities (Rees v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 17 October 1986, Series A no. 106, \u00a7 37, Gaskin v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 160, \u00a7 42; Sheffield and Horsham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 July 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998 V, \u00a7 52; Osman v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, \u00a7 116; and Appleby and Others v. the United Kingdom, no. 44306/98, \u00a7 40, ECHR 2003 VI).\n33. The Court notes that, as a matter of general policy, requests by prisoners in the United Kingdom for artificial insemination are only granted by the authorities in exceptional circumstances. In reaching a decision as to whether such circumstances exist in any individual case, particular attention is given by the authorities to a number of general considerations which are set out in the Secretary of State\u2019s letter of 28 May 2003. As explained by the respondent Government, and as reflected in the judgments of the Court of Appeal in the above-cited Mellor case and in the present case, two principal aims underlie the policy: the maintenance of public confidence in the penal system and the welfare of any child conceived as a result of artificial insemination and, therefore, the general interests of society as a whole.\n34. As to the former aim, while reiterating that there is no place under the Convention system, where tolerance and broadmindedness are the acknowledged hallmarks of democratic society, for automatic forfeiture of rights by prisoners based purely on what might offend public opinion (the above-cited Hirst judgment, at \u00a7 70), the Court nevertheless accepts that the maintaining of public confidence in the penal system has a legitimate role to play in the development of penal policy within prisons. The Court also considers valid that, in developing and applying the policy, the authorities retained certain criteria which concerned the interests of any child to be conceived. The very object of a request for artificial insemination is the conception of a child and the State has positive obligations to ensure the effec", "001-84379": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF OPA\u0141KO v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n20. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-23, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n22. The Government did not comment on the merits of the applicant's complaint.\n23. The Court notes that the proceedings commenced on 22 January 1992. However, the period to be taken into consideration began only on 1 May 1993, when the recognition by Poland of the right of individual petition took effect. Nevertheless, in assessing the reasonableness of the time that elapsed after that date, account must be taken of the state of proceedings at the time.\nThe period in question ended on 19 April 2006. It thus lasted almost 13 years for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n24. The Government raised an objection that the applicant cannot be considered a \u201cvictim\u201d, within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention, of a violation of his right to a hearing within a reasonable time. The Court notes that this issue falls to be determined in the light of the principles established under the Court's case-law (Cocchiarella v. Italy [GC], no. 64886/01, \u00a7\u00a7 69\u2011107, ECHR 2006\u2011... and Scordino v. Italy (no. 1) [GC], no. 36813/97, \u00a7\u00a7 178\u2011213, ECHR 2006 - ...).\n25. The Wroclaw Court of Appeal analysed the course of the impugned proceedings in the light of the criteria which the Court itself applies. It concluded that the Regional Court had violated the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay and awarded the applicant the equivalent of EUR 514 in respect of the length of the proceedings. The just satisfaction awarded by the Court of Appeal amounts to approximately 7 per cent of what the Court would be likely to have awarded the applicant at that time in accordance with its practice, taking into account the particular circumstances of the proceedings. The Court thus concludes that the redress provided to the applicant at domestic level, considered on the basis of the facts of which he complains before the Court, was insufficient (see Czajka v. Poland, no. 15067/02, \u00a7 56, 13 February 2007). In these circumstances, the argument that the applicant has lost his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d cannot be upheld.\n26. The Government also submitted that the applicant had not exhausted remedies available under Polish law. They maintained that he had not lodged a civil claim for compensation for damage suffered due to the excessive length of proceedings with the Polish civil courts under Article 417 of the Civil Code.\n27. The applicant contested the Government's arguments and submitted that he had made use of a remedy available to him and, particularly given his advanced age, he should not be required to initiate another set of proceedings.\n28. The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention requires an applicant first to use the remedies provided by the national legal system. The rule is based on the assumption that the domestic system provides an effective remedy in respect of the alleged breach. In order to comply with the rule, normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged (see Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2275\u201376, \u00a7\u00a7 51\u201352).\n29. The Court also reiterates that, although Article 35 \u00a7 1 requires that the complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, it does not require that, in cases where the national law provides for several parallel remedies in various branches of law, the person concerned, after an attempt to obtain redress through one such remedy, must necessarily try all other means (see, mutatis mutandis, H.D. v. Poland (dec.), no. 33310/96, 7 June 2001, Kaniewski v. Poland, no. 38049/02, \u00a7\u00a7 32-39, 8 November 2005).\n30.

Section 29 provides that even in the absence of the parties hearings are to be held, the proceedings are to continue and the case is not be suspended.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the length of the civil proceedings had exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n15. The Government requested the Court to take into account solely the proceedings which took place after 28 January 1987, the date of deposit of Turkey's declaration recognising the right of individual petition to the European Commission of Human Rights. Moreover, they submitted that the applicant had only become a party to the proceedings as of 22 November 2004 when he began to be represented by a lawyer. The applicant did not make any comment.\n16. The Court notes that it is not clear from the case file exactly when the applicant became a party to the proceedings, which began on 28 August 1972. The first mention of the applicant in the proceedings dates back to 9 June 1983, when the trial court requested the applicant's address to be determined. In the absence of any document indicating that the applicant had become involved in the proceedings before then, the Court considers that it should take 9 June 1983 as the date the proceedings began in respect of the applicant. It notes that they are still pending before the domestic courts. Taking into account of the Court's competence ratione temporis, they have thus already lasted some twenty-two years and nine months since the Government's recognition of the right of individual petition on 28 January 1987. It notes, however, that by that date the proceedings had apparently already been pending some three years and seven months in respect of the applicant.\n#### B. Admissibility\n17. The Government argued that the applicant lacked victim status as he had only recently become involved in the proceedings. The applicant did not make any comment.\n18. The Court accepts that the applicant did not pursue the proceedings with due diligence. Nevertheless, it notes that the Land Registry Act (Law no. 3402) requires the domestic courts to continue with the proceedings and resolve the issues even in the absence of both parties (see paragraph 13 above). Accordingly, it considers that the applicant can claim to be the victim of excessively lengthy proceedings (see Mahmut and Z\u00fclf\u00fc Bal\u0131k\u00e7\u0131 v. Turkey, nos. 19895/03 and 21302/03, \u00a7 28, 21 October 2008).\n19. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### C. Merits\n20.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n13. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki) (\u201cthe 2004 Act\u201d), which entered into force on 17 September 2004, refer only to the judicial phase of the proceedings. The investigation phase of criminal proceedings is excluded from the scope of the 2004 Act.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n14. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination .... of any criminal charge against him ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n15. The Government contested that argument.\n16. The period to be taken into consideration began on 23 October 2003 and has not yet ended. It has thus lasted over five years and the proceedings are still at the investigation phase.\n#### A. Admissibility\n17. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n(a) The Government\n18. Relying on arguments related to the high degree of complexity of the case, and the number of suspects and witnesses that had to be heard, the Government submitted that the national authorities displayed due diligence in ensuring the proper examination of the case. They further noted that the length of the investigation had been partly attributable to the applicant who \u201cexcessively\u201d exercised his procedural rights and lodged numerous appeals against many decisions in the course of proceedings.\n(b) The applicant\n19. The applicant submitted that the length of proceedings against him was unreasonable. He also maintained that he had been suspended from his professional duties for a long time and could not support his family and therefore had to apply for early retirement.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n20. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n21. The Court admits that the case is indeed complicated in terms of the number of suspects and witnesses to be heard. However, the complexity of the case is not such as to lead to the investigation lasting five years without an indictment or the beginning of judicial proceedings in sight.\n22. The Court likewise cannot accept the Government\u2019s argument that the length of proceedings is in a considerable part attributable to the applicant, who on numerous occasions appealed against the decisions extending the preventive measure imposed on him or requested the courts to lift or replace it by some other, less severe preventive measure. The Court considers that the normal use of an applicant\u2019s procedural rights, without the appearance of overusing them or lodging numerous manifestly ill-founded or trivial requests, cannot lead to the conclusion that the responsibility for the excessive length of proceedings is attributable to the applicant (see, by contrast, Malicka-W\u0105sowska no. 41413/98 (dec.) and Buchholz v. Germany, judgment of 6 May 1981, Series A no. 42, pp. 21-22, \u00a7 63).

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant complained that the domestic proceedings were not concluded within a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, so far as material:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations (...), everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Arguments of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n28. The Government accepted that the relevant period for the purposes of the \u201creasonable time\u201d aspect of the complaint ran from 4 July 1984 until 19 April 1999, a total of fourteen years and nine and a half months. However, they submitted that, although the proceedings were unusually long, only a small proportion of the total delay could be attributed to the State.\nThus, they highlighted the fact that the proceedings were both factually and procedurally complex; the factual complexity was illustrated by, inter alia, the length of the trial, while the insolvency of the defendant companies during the appeal proceedings led to much greater procedural complexity before the Court of Appeal.\n29. The Government also argued that the applicant did not show sufficient diligence in his conduct of the proceedings. In the High Court, he caused delay by entering judgment in default despite knowing that the defendants were in the course of formulating their defence. The claim was vaguely drafted, necessitating a request for Further and Better Particulars, to which the applicant failed to respond in a timely manner. The Summons for Directions was served more than four years late, and the plaintiffs manifestly failed to fulfil their discovery obligations. Furthermore, there were periods in which the applicant took no steps at all to progress the case to trial, and he failed to avail himself in a timely manner of means provided to ensure that the defendants fulfilled their obligations in connection with the proceedings. The trial had to be adjourned due to the applicant\u2019s illness.\nIn the Court of Appeal, there was a delay of one year in providing the court with transcripts of evidence from the trial; to the extent that that delay was attributable to the court reporters, the Government submitted that the State could not be held responsible. The Government also pointed to the fact that the applicant consented to the appeal being stood out of the list following the entry into receivership of Ferranti plc.\n30. The Government referred to the applicant\u2019s allegations of use by the defendants of \u201cdelaying tactics\u201d in the proceedings, and submitted that the State\u2019s obligations in this regard were discharged by the presence of mechanisms allowing the applicant to take action to counter such tactics. The defendants\u2019 applications for security for costs, and their failure to apply to have the action dismissed for want of prosecution, also caused delay for which the Government could not be held responsible.\n31. As for the competent authorities, the Government contended that the High Court made provision for the various hearings required without significant or undue delay, while the Court of Appeal was blameworthy only for the period of delay between 25 March 1997 and 8 April 1998. They accepted that some files in connection with the action were lost by the CAO but submitted that the loss in no way delayed the hearing of the appeal. In the context of proceedings which took more than fourteen years in all, they argued that a delay of just over a year on the part of the competent authorities could not justify a finding of violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n##### 2. The applicant\n32. The applicant submitted that the length of the proceedings was such that, in itself, it gave rise to a violation of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement in Article 6 \u00a7 1. He did not consider that the proceedings were particularly complex. Delaying tactics were used by the defendants, but the competent authorities were responsible for more than five years of delay in all.\n33. In respect of his own conduct and that of his fellow plaintiff, the applicant contended that entry of judgment in default probably had the result of reducing the time taken by the defendants to lodge a Defence to the action. He was unaware of the importance of the Summons for Directions and the long delays in serving the plaintiffs\u2019 list of documents were due to their desire to provide their list only when that of the defendants was ready. His priority throughout the proceedings was to obtain justice in the shortest time possible and to avoid the financial costs of protracted legal proceedings. Although the trial had to be adjourned in June 1991 due to his illness, the fact that it was not resumed until April 1992 was largely due to there being insufficient court time available. The delay of nearly a year in lodging transcripts of the trial with the Court of Appeal was attributable to the official court reporters and thus imputable to the Government.\n34. The applicant alleged that the courts were guilty of significant delays in hearing various applications in the course of the proceedings, in particular, delays in the hearing of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal against the first award of security for costs in 1985, their application for an order requiring Further and Better Particulars of the Defence in 1986, and the various preliminary matters before the District Registrar and High Court in 1989 and early 1990. He stated also that no effort was made by the CAO to advise him at any time as to the conduct of the appeal following his letter of 18 June 1996 confirming that he would be proceeding with the appeal in person. The documentation was misplaced and the CAO was slow in determining the status of the defendants, and the investigation of his complaints about the CAO was ineffective. The CAO made no real effort to progress the appeal until June 1998.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s conclusion\n35. The proceedings in the present case commenced on 4 July 1984, when the applicant and the plaintiff company issued a writ against the two defendant companies. The proceedings were not concluded until 19 April 1999, fourteen years, nine and a half months later, when the plaintiffs were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.\n36. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, regard being had to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the parties\u2019 conduct and that of the competent authorities, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the litigation (see, among many other authorities, the Gast and Popp v. Germany judgment of 25 February 2000, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 2000-II, \u00a7 70).\n37. The Court considers that the proceedings were both factually and procedurally complex, as demonstrated by the fact that the first instance trial lasted over six weeks (see paragraph 19 above). The subsequent administrative receivership of Ferranti in 1993, moreover, inevitably led to some delay in the appeal proceedings (see paragraphs 21 and 22 above). These matters reduce the period of time for which the respondent State can be held accountable under Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n38. In addition, the Court is of the view that the majority of the delays were attributable to the conduct of the parties to the proceedings or of third parties for which the State is not responsible. For example, the plaintiffs failed to comply with the deadline for serving a list of documents, which expired on 3 January 1985, and the defendants did not apply for an order requiring discovery until 21 May 1987 (see paragraph 15 above). In addition, the plaintiffs were almost ", "001-58458": "\ufeff\nCASE OF CABALLERO v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 32819/96)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n8 February 2000\nIn the case of Caballero v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 27 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), as amended by Protocol No. 110, and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Grand Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr L. Wildhaber, President,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr A. Pastor Ridruejo,\nMr G. Bonello,\nMr J. Makarczyk,\nMr P. K\u016bris,\nMr J.-P. Costa,\nMrs F. Tulkens,\nMrs V. Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1,\nMr M.

Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 September 1999 and 10 January 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n9. Section 4 of the Bail Act 1976 as amended (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) provided that a person accused of a criminal offence should be granted bail except as stated in Schedule 1 to the Act. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 provided that a defendant need not be granted bail if the court was satisfied that there were substantial grounds for believing that the defendant, if released on bail, would fail to surrender to custody, commit an offence while on bail or\ninterfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to himself or any other person.\n10. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, in taking the above decision, the court was to have regard to such of the following considerations, as well as to any other considerations, as appeared to that court to be relevant:\n\u2013 the nature and seriousness of the offence or default (and the probable method of dealing with the defendant for it);\n\u2013 the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant;\n\u2013 the defendant\u2019s record as regards the fulfilment of his obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; and\n\u2013 except in the case of a defendant whose case was adjourned for inquiries or a report, the strength of the evidence of his having committed the offence or having defaulted.\n11. According to paragraph 9A of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, if a defendant (who had been charged with murder, manslaughter, rape, attempted murder or attempted rape) was granted bail and representations had been made as regards the matters mentioned in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1, the court had to state its reasons for granting bail and cause those reasons to be included in the record of the proceedings.\n12. Section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) came into force on 10 April 1995 and provided as follows:\n\u201c(1) A person who in any proceedings has been charged with or convicted of an offence to which this section applies and in circumstances to which it applies shall not be granted bail in those proceedings.\n(2) This section applies, subject to subsection (3) below, to the following offences, ... \u2013\n(a) murder;\n(b) attempted murder;\n(c) manslaughter;\n(d) rape; or\n(e) attempted rape.\n(3) This section applies to a person charged with or convicted of any such offence only if he has been previously convicted by or before a court in any part of the United Kingdom of any such offence or of culpable homicide and, in the case of a previous conviction of manslaughter or culpable homicide, if he was then sentenced to imprisonment or, if he was then a child or young person, to long-term detention under any of the relevant enactments.\n\u2026\u201d\n13. Section 25 of the 1994 Act has been amended by section 56 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which entered into force on 30 September 1998. Section 56 of the 1998 Act reads as follows:\n\u201cIn subsection (1) of section 25 of the 1994 Act (no bail for defendants charged with or convicted of homicide or rape after previous conviction of such offences), for the words \u2018shall not be granted bail in those proceedings\u2019 there shall be substituted the words \u2018shall be granted bail in those proceedings only if the court or, as the case may be, the constable considering the grant of bail is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances which justify it\u2019.\u201d\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n14. Mr Caballero applied to the Commission on 28 June 1996. He alleged that the automatic denial of bail prior to his trial constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention both taken alone and in conjunction with Article 13. He also claimed that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3.\n15. The Commission declared the application (no. 32819/96) admissible on 1 December 1997. In its report of 30 June 1998 (former Article 31 of the Convention), it expressed the opinion, by nineteen votes to twelve, that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 and that it was not necessary also to consider the complaint under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. It also expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been no violation of Article 13. The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n16. The Government in their memorial conceded that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. The Government also submitted that, for the reasons set out in the Commission\u2019s report, they considered that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention and that no separate issue arose under Article 14.\n17. The applicant maintained his complaints under Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention and under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. He did not pursue his complaint under Article 13 before the Court.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention\n18. The applicant claimed that the automatic denial of bail pending his trial pursuant to section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (\u201cthe 1994 Act\u201d) constituted a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. He also complained that he did not have an enforceable right to compensation in this respect within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 5 of the Convention.\n19. The relevant parts of Article 5 of the Convention read as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n...\n5. Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\u201d\n20. The majority of the Commission was of the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. In their memorial to the Court, the Government conceded that there had been a violation of those provisions.\n21. The Court accepts the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention in the present case, with the consequence that it is empowered to make an award of just satisfaction to the applicant under Article 41, but it does not consider it necessary in the particular circumstances to examine the issues of interpretation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 raised by the applicant\u2019s complaint.\n### II. alleged violation of Article 13 of the Convention\n22. The applicant contended before the Commission that he did not have an effective domestic remedy in relation to the breaches of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 5 of the Convention. Article 13 reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n23. The Commission was of the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 13 of the Convention. The Government supported this conclusion before the Court, relying on the reasons set out in the Commission\u2019s report.\n24. The applicant did not pursue this complaint at all before the Court, which sees no cause to examine it of its own motion.\n### III. alleged violation of Article 14 of the Convention\n25. The applicant further submitted that section 25 of the 1994 Act constituted a discriminatory difference in treatment contrary to Article 14 of the Convention when taken in conjunction with Article 5 \u00a7 3. Article 14 reads as follows:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n26. The Commission found no necessity in the circumstances to examine this complaint. Before the Court, the Government agreed with this conclusion, again relying on the reasons outlined by the Commission in its report.\n27. The Court notes that section 25 of the 1994 Act operated by selecting certain accused persons to whom bail could not be granted prior to trial. In view of its acceptance of the Government\u2019s concession in connection with Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 21 above), the Court does not find it necessary also to consider the applicant\u2019s complaint about section 25 of the 1994 Act under Article 14.\n### IV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A. Damage\n29. The applicant did not allege any pecuniary damage. However, he sought an unspecified amount of compensation for non-pecuniary damage, arguing that a decision not to make such an award would strip Article 5 \u00a7 5 of any effectiveness. He also submitted an affidavit of a solicitor in the United Kingdom who has practised since 1985 exclusively in criminal law and advocacy in the criminal courts. The affidavit details why, according to\nthe deponent, the applicant would have had a good chance of being granted bail prior to his trial had section 25 of the 1994 Act not been in force. The Government did not comment on this claim.\n30. The Court recalls that in certain cases which concerned violations of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 it has made relatively small awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage (see the Van Droogenbroeck v. Belgium judgment of 25 April 1983 (Article 50), Series A no. 63, p. 7, \u00a7 13, and the De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p. 29, \u00a7 65). However, in more recent cases, it has declined to make any such award (see the Pauwels v. Belgium judgment of 26 May 1988, Series A no. 135, p. 20, \u00a7 46; the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 May 1989 (Article 50), Series A no. 152-B, pp. 44-45, \u00a7 9; the Huber v. Switzerland judgment of 23 October 1990, Series A no. 188, p. 19, \u00a7 46; the Toth v. Austria judgment of 12 December 1991, Series A no. 224, p. 24, \u00a7 91; the Kampanis v. Greece judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 318-B, p. 49, \u00a7 66; Hood v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 27267/95, \u00a7\u00a7 84-87; ECHR 1999-I; and Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 76, ECHR 1999-II).

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n20. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in the cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005\u2011V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34\u201146, ECHR 2005\u2011V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 6 \u00a7 1 AND 7 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF THE PROCEEDINGS\n21. The applicants first complained that the proceedings in their case had been unfair. In particular, they alleged that the courts had committed errors of fact and law. This complaint falls to be examined under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in its relevant part, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n22. The Court reiterates that, according to Article 19 of the Convention, its duty is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.\n23. In the present case the applicants did not allege any particular failure to respect his right to a fair hearing on the part of the relevant courts. Indeed, their complaints are limited to a challenge to their allegedly wrongful conviction. Assessing the circumstances of the case as a whole, the Court finds no indication that the impugned proceedings were conducted unfairly.\nIt follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill\u2011founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNREASONABLE LENGTH OF PROCEEDINGS\n24. The applicants complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n25. The Government contested that argument.\n26. The applicants submitted that they had been charged on 16 December 1993. The Government did not contest that date. However, they submitted that the proceedings at issue started on 18 October1994 when the first hearing took place. Having regard to its extensive case\u2011law on the subject, the Court considers that the period to be taken into consideration began on 16 December 1993 when the applicants were charged, and ended on 21 February 2005 when the Gliwice Regional Court dismissed their appeal. It thus lasted 11 years, 2 months and 9 days for two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n27. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n28. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the a", "001-87626": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF \u00dcTEBAY v.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n15. The Government submitted that the case should be struck out of the Court's list of cases on the ground that the applicant's family were not affected by the alleged violations and could therefore not claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.\n16. The Court reiterates that in a number of cases in which an applicant died in the course of the proceedings, it has taken account of the statements of the applicants' heirs or close family members expressing their wish to pursue the case before the Court (see, among many other authorities, Dalban v. Romania [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 39, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Latif Fuat \u00d6zt\u00fcrk v. Turkey, no. 54673/00, \u00a7 27, 2 February 2006; Mutlu v. Turkey, no. 8006/02, \u00a7\u00a7 13\u201314, 10 October 2006). In the present case the Court considers that, apart from having explicitly expressed their wish to do so, the applicant's family have sufficient legitimate interests in obtaining a ruling that the length of the applicant's detention pending trial and the criminal proceedings against him was excessive, in breach of Articles 5 \u00a7 3 and 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n17. In view of the above, the Court holds that the applicant's family has standing to continue the present proceedings in the applicant's stead. Consequently, the Government's objection that the case should be struck out is dismissed.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that his detention pending trial had exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n19. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. With reference to the ruling of the Court in its Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece judgment (cited above), they contended that the applicant had not raised his complaint before the domestic courts.\n21. The applicant denied the Government's allegations.\n22. The Court notes that, on various occasions during the proceedings, the applicant expressly complained about the length of his detention pending trial and unsuccessfully requested the trial court to release him. Against this background the Court finds that the applicant must be considered to have complied with Article 35 \u00a7 1. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government's objection.\n23. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n24. The Government submitted that the applicant's detention pending trial had complied with domestic law. In view of the seriousness of the charges brought against him and the evidence in the case file, the court had prolonged that detention.\n25. The Court notes that, in the instant case, the period to be taken into consideration began on 7 March 1994 with the applicant's arrest and ended on 5 April 2004, when the applicant was released pending trial. It thus lasted nearly 10 years and 1 month. During this period, the domestic courts prolonged the applicant's detention on remand using identical, stereotyped terms, such as \u201chaving regard to the nature of the offence, the state of evidence and the duration of detention\u201d.\n26. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention in cases raising similar issues to those in the present application (see, for example, At\u0131c\u0131 v. Turkey (no. 1), no. 19735/02, \u00a7 50, 10 May 2007; Dereci v. Turkey, no. 77845/01, \u00a7\u00a7 38-40, 24 May 2005; Taciro\u011flu v. Turkey, no. 25324/02, \u00a7 24, 2 February 2006).\n27. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, it considers that in the instant case the length of the applicant's detention pending trial was excessive and contravened Article 5 \u00a7 3 ", "001-78429": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DEPA v.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1997, which entered into force on 1 September 1998, defines detention on remand as one of the so\u2011called \u201cpreventive measures\u201d (\u015brodki zapobiegawcze).\nArticle 249 \u00a7 5 provides that the lawyer of a detained person should be informed of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning the prolongation of detention on remand.\n27. A more detailed rendition of the relevant domestic law provisions is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 75, ECHR 2000\u2011XI, Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7\u00a7 22 and 23, 4 May 2006.\n28. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for the excessive length of judicial proceedings are stated in the Court\u2019s decisions in cases of Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201123, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005\u2011VIII and the judgment in the case of Krasuski v. Poland, no. 61444/00, \u00a7\u00a7 34-46, ECHR 2005-V.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that the length of his detention on remand had been unreasonable. He relied on Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n30. The Government refrained from expressing an opinion on whether the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention satisfied the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3. The Government submitted, however, that his pre-trial detention was duly justified and that during the entire period the authorities had given relevant and sufficient reasons for prolonging it. Moreover, the Government argued that the domestic courts had acted diligently and speedily, particularly in view of the complexity of the case, which had involved several co\u2011accused.\n#### A. Admissibility\n31. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n32. Under the Court\u2019s case-law, the issue of whether a period of detention is reasonable cannot be assessed in abstracto. Whether it is reasonable for an accused to remain in detention must be assessed in each case according to its special features. Continued detention can be justified in a given case only if there are specific indications of a genuine requirement of public interest which, notwithstanding the presumption of innocence, outweighs the rule of respect for individual liberty (see, among other authorities, W. v. Switzerland, judgment of 26 January 1993, Series A no. 254\u2011A, p. 15, \u00a7 30, and Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 110, ECHR 2000\u2011XI)\n33. The presumption is in favour of release. As established in Neumeister v. Austria (judgment of 27 June 1968, Series A no. 8, p. 37, \u00a7 4), the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 3 does not give the judicial authorities a choice between either bringing an accused to trial within a reasonable time or granting him provisional release pending trial. Until conviction, he must be presumed innocent, and the purpose of the provision under consideration is essentially to require his provisional release once his continuing detention ceases to be reasonable (see McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-...).\n34. It falls in the first place to the national judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the pre-trial detention of an accused person does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of the presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty and set them out in their decisions dismissing the applications for release. It is essentially on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions and of the established facts mentioned by the applicant in his appeals, that the Court is called upon to decide whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see McKay, cited above, \u00a7 43).\n35. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a condition sine qua non for the lawfulness of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time it no longer suffices. In such cases, the Court must establish whether the other grounds given by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty. Where such grounds were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, the Court must also ascertain whether the competent national authorities displayed \u201cspecial diligence\u201d in the conduct of the proceedings (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7 153, ECHR 2000\u2011IV, and Jablonski v. Poland, no. 33492/96, \u00a7 80, 21 December 2000).\n##### 2. Application of the principles to the circumstances of the present case\n36. The Court first notes that the applicant had been detained on remand on 14 January 1998 and that the first-instance judgment was given on 10 January 2000. Subsequently, on 13 April 2000, the appeal court quashed the judgment and remitted the case. The applicant\u2019s detention on remand lasted until 6 February 2002 when the trial court again convicted him. Moreover, the period between 27 March and 11 August 1998 should be deducted from the overall period of his detention as during this time the applicant had been serving a prison sentence ordered in another set of criminal proceedings. The detention thus lasted 3 years and 5 months.\n37. The Court observes that in the present case the authorities relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and on the severity of the sentence that might be imposed. They repeated those grounds in all their decisions. The authorities failed to advance any other justifications to prolong the applicant\u2019s detention.\n38. The Court accepts that the suspicion against the applicant of having committed the offences and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings might initially justify his detention. However, with the passage of time, these grounds became less relevant and cannot justify the entire period of 3 years and 5 months during which the most serious preventive measure against the applicant had been imposed (see Malik v. Poland, no. 57477/00, \u00a7 45, 4 April 2006).\n39. Moreover, the authorities relied heavily on the likelihood that a severe sentence would be imposed on the applicant given the serious nature of the offences at issue. In this respect, the Court agrees that the severity of the sentence faced is a relevant element in the assessment of the risk of absconding or re-offending. However, the Court has repeatedly held that the gravity of the charges cannot by itself serve to justify long periods of detention on remand (see Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7\u00a7 80\u201181, 26 July 2001).\n40. The Court further observes that the applicant was detained on charges of, inter alia, attempted homicide and was finally convicted of causing bodily harm. Moreover, even though the applicant had committed these crimes with the help of accomplices, there is no indication that he was a member of an organised criminal group. It does not appear therefore that his case presented particular difficulties for the investigation authorities and for the courts to determine the facts and mount a case against the perpetrator as would undoubtedly have been the case had the proceedings concerned organised crime (see Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, \u00a7 37, 4 May 2006; Dudek v. Poland, no. 633/03, \u00a7 36, 4 May 2006).\n41. Finally, the Court would emphasise that under Article 5 \u00a7 3 the authorities, when deciding whether a person is to be released or detained, are obliged to consider alternative measures of ensuring his appearance at the trial. Indeed, that Article lays down not only the right to \u201ctrial within a reasonable time or release pending trial\u201d but also provides that \u201crelease may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial\u201d (see Jablonski, cited above, \u00a7 83).\nIn the present case the Court notes that there is no express indication that during the entire period of the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention the authorities envisaged any other means of guaranteeing his appearance at trial. Nor did they give any consideration to the possibility of ensuring his presence at trial by imposing on him other \u201cpreventive measures\u201d expressly foreseen by Polish law to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings.\n42. The Court is, therefore, not satisfied that the reasons given to justify the applicant\u2019s detention for 3 years and 5 months were \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, as required under Article 5 \u00a7 3.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### II.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The domestic law and practice relating to the procedure for setting a whole life order under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is set out in paragraphs 12-13 and 35-41 of the Court\u2019s judgment in Vinter and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 66069/09, 130/10 and 3896/10, 9 July 2013.\n10. As regards the discretion of the Secretary of State for Justice to release a prisoner sentenced to a whole life order, section 30(1) of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (\u201csection 30\u201d) provides that he may at any time release a life prisoner on licence if he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which justify the prisoner\u2019s release on compassionate grounds. The criteria for the exercise of that discretion are set out in chapter 12 of the Indeterminate Sentence Manual (\u201cthe Lifer Manual\u201d), issued by the Secretary of State as Prison Service Order 4700 in April 2010.\nChapter 12 of the Lifer Manual, where relevant, provides:\n\u201cThe criteria for compassionate release on medical grounds for all indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISP) are as follows:\n\u2022 the prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness and death is likely to occur very shortly (although there are no set time limits, 3 months may be considered to be an appropriate period for an application to be made to Public Protection Casework Section [PPCS]), or the ISP (Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoner) is bedridden or similarly incapacitated, for example, those paralysed or suffering from a severe stroke;\nand\n\u2022 the risk of re-offending (particularly of a sexual or violent nature) is minimal;\nand\n\u2022 further imprisonment would reduce the prisoner\u2019s life expectancy;\nand\n\u2022 there are adequate arrangements for the prisoner\u2019s care and treatment outside prison;\nand\n\u2022 early release will bring some significant benefit to the prisoner or his/her family.\u201d\n[underlining in the original]\n11. Under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the Secretary of State, as a public authority, is bound to act compatibly with the scheduled Convention rights, including Article 3. Under section 3 of the Human Rights Act, legislation is to be interpreted so far as it is possible to do so compatibly with the Convention.\n12. A summary of the existing domestic case-law relating to the compatibility of the whole life order scheme with Article 3 of the Convention, notably the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes and Others and the House of Lords judgment in R (Wellington) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, was set out in Vinter and Others, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 47-58.\n13. The Grand Chamber delivered its judgment in Vinter and Others on 9 July 2013. For reasons discussed in more detail below, it held that there had been a violation of Article 3 in relation to the whole life orders imposed on the applicants because, given the lack of clarity in domestic law concerning the existence of an Article 3-compliant review mechanism, it appeared that the sentences were irrreducible. Following the Vinter and Others judgment, a special composition of the Court of Appeal was constituted, including the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the President of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, the Vice-President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, one other Lord Justice of Appeal and a senior High Court judge, to consider three appeals by defendants on whom whole life orders had been imposed and a reference by the Attorney-General in a case where it was contended that the trial judge had been mistaken in his view that the judgment in Vinter precluded the imposition of a whole life order. The Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in this case, R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin [2014] EWCA Crim 188 was delivered on 18 February 2014. On the question whether whole life orders were reducible and thus compliant with Article 3, the Court of Appeal held:\n\u201c25. The questions therefore arise as to whether the provisions of s.30 provide such a regime compatible with Article 3 as interpreted by the Grand Chamber and on the assumption that, discharging our duty under s.2 of the Human Rights Act to take into account the decision of the Strasbourg Court, we should adopt that interpretation.\n26. Lord Phillips CJ in giving the judgment of this court in R v Bieber concluded that the regime was compatible and a whole life order was reducible, because of the power of the Secretary of State under s.30 of the 1997 Act. He said at paragraph 48:\n\u2018At present it is the practice of the Secretary of State to use this power sparingly, in circumstances where, for instance, a prisoner is suffering from a terminal illness or is bedridden or similarly incapacitated. If, however, the position is reached where the continued imprisonment of a prisoner is held to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, we can see no reason why, having particular regard to the requirement to comply with the Convention, the Secretary of State should not use his statutory power to release the prisoner.\u2019\nIn R v Oakes, this was reaffirmed in the judgment of this court \u2013 see paragraph 15.\n27. The Grand Chamber whilst accepting that the interpretation of s.30 of the 1997 Act as set out in R v Bieber would in principle be consistent with the decision in Kafkaris, was concerned that the law might be insufficiently certain. It added at paragraphs 126-7:\n\u2018The fact remains that, despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in Bieber, the Secretary of State has not altered the terms of his explicitly stated and restrictive policy on when he will exercise his s.30 power. Notwithstanding the reading given to s.30 by the Court of Appeal, the Prison Service Order remains in force and provides that release will only be ordered in certain exhaustively listed, and not merely illustrative, circumstances, ...\nThese are highly restrictive conditions. Even assuming that they could be met by a prisoner serving a whole life order, the Court considers that the Chamber was correct to doubt whether compassionate release for the terminally ill or physically incapacitated could really be considered release at all, if all it meant was that a prisoner died at home or in a hospice rather than behind prison walls. Indeed, in the Court\u2019s view, compassionate release of this kind was not what was meant by a \u201cprospect of release\u201d in Kafkaris, cited above. As such, the terms of the Order in themselves would be inconsistent with Kafkaris and would not therefore be sufficient for the purposes of Article 3.\u2019\n28. The Grand Chamber therefore concluded that s.30 did not, because of the lack of certainty, provide an appropriate and adequate avenue of redress in the event an offender sought to show that his continued imprisonment was not justified. It concluded at paragraph 129:\n\u2018At the present time, it is unclear whether, in considering such an application for release under s.30 by a whole life prisoner, the Secretary of State would apply his existing, restrictive policy, as set out in the Prison Service Order, or would go beyond the apparently exhaustive terms of that Order by applying the Article 3 test set out in Bieber. Of course, any ministerial refusal to release would be amenable to judicial review and it could well be that, in the course of such proceedings, the legal position would come to be clarified, for example by the withdrawal and replacement of the Prison Service Order by the Secretary of State or its quashing by the courts. However, such possibilities are not sufficient to remedy the lack of clarity that exists at present as to the state of the applicable domestic law governing possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners.\u2019\n29. We disagree. In our view, the domestic law of England and Wales is clear as to \u2018possible exceptional release of whole life prisoners\u2019. As is set out in R v Bieber the Secretary of State is bound to exercise his power under s.30 of the 1997 Act in a manner compatible with principles of domestic administrative law and with Article 3.\n30. As we understand the Grand Chamber\u2019s view, it might have been thought that the fact that policy set out in the Lifer Manual has not been revised is of real consequence. However, as a matter of law, it is, in our view, of no consequence. It is important, therefore, that we make clear what the law of England and Wales is.\n31. First, the power of review under the section arises if there are exceptional circumstances. The offender subject to the whole life order is therefore required to demonstrate to the Secretary of State that although the whole life order was just punishment at the time the order was made, exceptional circumstances have since arisen. It is not necessary to specify what such circumstances are or specify criteria; the term \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 is of itself sufficiently certain.\n32. Second, the Secretary of State must then consider whether such exceptional circumstances justify the release on compassionate grounds. The policy set out in the Lifer Manual is highly restrictive and purports to circumscribe the matters which will be considered by the Secretary of State. The Manual cannot restrict the duty of the Secretary of State to consider all circumstances relevant to release on compassionate grounds. He cannot fetter his discretion by taking into account only the matters set out in the Lifer Manual. In the passages in Hindley to which we have referred at paragraph 7 the duty of the Secretary of State was made clear; similarly the provisions of s.30 of the 1997 Act require the Secretary of State to take in to account all exceptional circumstances relevant to the release of the prisoner on compassionate grounds.\n33. Third, the term \u2018compassionate grounds\u2019 must be read, as the court made clear in R v Bieber, in a manner compatible with Article 3. They are not restricted to what is set out in the Lifer Manual. It is a term with a wide meaning that can be elucidated, as is the way the common law develops, on a case by case basis.\n34. Fourth, the decision of the Secretary of State must be reasoned by reference to the circumstances of each case and is subject to scrutiny by way of judicial review.\n35. In our judgment the law of England and Wales therefore does provide to an offender \u2018hope\u2019 or the \u2018possibility\u2019 of release in exceptional circumstances which render the just punishment originally imposed no longer justifiable.\n36. It is entirely consistent with the rule of law that such requests are considered on an individual basis against the criteria that circumstances have exceptionally changed so as to render the original punishment which was justifiable no longer justifiable. We find it difficult to specify in advance what such circumstances might be, given that the heinous nature of the original crime justly required punishment by imprisonment for life. But circumstances can and do change in exceptional cases. The interpretation of s.30 we have set out provides for that possibility and hence gives to each such prisoner the possibility of exceptional release.\nConclusion\n37. Judges should therefore continue to apply the statutory scheme in the [Criminal Justice Act] 2003 and in exceptional cases, likely to be rare, impose whole life orders in accordance with Schedule 21. Although we were told by [counsel for the Secretary of State] that it might be many years before the applications might be made under s.30 and the three applicants in Vinter (Vinter, Bamber and Moore) did not seek to contend that there were no longer penological grounds for their continued detention, we would observe that we would no discount the possibility of such applications arising very much sooner. They will be determined in accordance with the legal principles we have set out.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that his whole life order violated Article 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n15. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 arguments\n16. The applicant submitted that his case was indistinguishable from Vinter and Others, cited above. The clarification offered by the Court of Appeal in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin was in substance identical to that set out in the earlier Court of Appeal judgments in R v. Bieber and R v. Oakes, which were considered by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others before it came to a finding of violation. Moreover, the applicant argued that the Convention was a living instrument and that there was a rapidly developing international consensus that the review of whole life orders required a judicial or quasi-judicial decision, rather than the decision of a Government Minister. The views expressed by the Secretary of State for Justice on the subject of whole life orders demonstrated that there was no realistic prospect of a fair, balanced and certain system under political control, and judicial review was no remedy for this, since it provided a review of process and not of substance. The reviewing court could examine whether the Secretary of State\u2019s decision was taken on improper grounds or was so unreasonable that no reasonable politician could have made it, but it was not open to the court to impose its own solution. In conclusion, in the applicant\u2019s submission, a mechanism \u201cpieced together\u201d from an executive discretion, a statutory provision limited to compassionate grounds and supervised at a distance by judicial review was too uncertain, lacked clarity and offered too vague a hope of release to pass the standard set out in Vinter and Others.\n17. Prior to the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in R v.Newell; R v. McLoughlin, the Government recognised that the principles set out by the Grand Chamber in Vinter and Others (cited above) \u201cwould appear on their face to apply to this case\u201d and that they did not, therefore, consider themselves in a position to submit observations on the merits. However, after the delivery of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment the Government indicated that they wished to submit observations. They underlined that the judgment in R v. Newell; R v. McLoughlin was now the binding and authoritative statement of the law in England and Wales. In that judgment the Court of Appeal set out the operation of domestic law, finding that the Secretary of State\u2019s power to release under section 30 of the 2003 Act functioned in precisely the way which the Grand Chamber held was in principle sufficient to render a whole life order reducible and this was compatible with Article 3 of the Convention. The Court of Appeal was uniquely well placed to determine this issue and its judgment had put to rest any suggestion that domestic law was in any relevant respect unclear.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\na. General principles relating to the need for a review mechanism in respect of whole life sentences\n18. It is well-established in the Court\u2019s case-law that a State\u2019s choice of a specific criminal justice system, including sentence review and release arrangements, is in principle outside the scope of the supervision the Court carries out at the European level, provided that the system does not contravene the principles set forth in the Convention. Contracting States must remain free to impose life sentences on adult offenders for especially serious crimes such as murder: the imposition of such a sentence on an adult offender is not in itself prohibited by or incompatible with Article 3 or any other Article of the Convention. This is particularly so when such a sentence is not mandatory but is imposed by an independent judge after he or she has con", "001-58409": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF MOORE AND GORDON v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The relevant provisions of the Air Force Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the Coyne case (the Coyne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1997-V, pp. 1848-52, \u00a7\u00a7 20-44).\n10. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n11. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n12. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n13. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court-martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command.\n14. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court-martial\u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.\n15. Since the applicants\u2019 trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, at p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57).\n16. The Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides for a penalty of up to six months\u2019 imprisonment, a fine or both for the offence of common assault. The maximum penalty for disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind is two years\u2019 imprisonment (section 66 of the 1955 Act).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. Each of the applicants complained, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that he did not have a fair or public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Article 6 \u00a7 1, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination \u2026 of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing \u2026 by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. \u2026\u201d\nA Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n18. The Court notes the potential penalty of six months\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Moore\u2019s case) and of two years\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Gordon\u2019s case), together with the nature of the charges of which the applicants were found guilty. It considers that the applicants\u2019 court-martial proceedings involved the determination of charges of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, the Garyfallou Aebe v. Greece judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1977-V, no. 49, p. 1830, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, with further references).\n#### B. Independence and impartiality of the applicants\u2019 courts-martial\n19. The applicants mainly argued that their courts-martial were not independent or impartial and that the proceedings against them were consequently unfair. The Government made no observations on the admissibility of the case except to note that it raised issues similar to those in respect of which the Court had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the above-cited Findlay case.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n35. The relevant domestic law concerning the enforcement of a parent\u2019s visiting rights is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case P.P. v. Poland no. 8677/03, \u00a7\u00a7 69-74, 8 January 2008.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter, M. He alleged a violation of Article 8 of the Convention, which provides\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Government submitted a preliminary objection that the applicant had failed to exhaust the required domestic remedies. They stressed that the applicant had failed to appeal against the decisions of 5 October 1995, 27 November 1997 and 7 January 2005.\n39. The applicant replied that he had made use of all available remedies in respect of his complaints.\n40. The Court notes, that in the present case the applicant did not object to the contact arrangements as specified in the decisions of 5 October 1995, 27 November 1997 and 7 January 2005. He only maintained that the Polish authorities had failed to take effective steps to enforce his right of contact with his daughter.\n41. In this respect the Court observes that it is true that the applicant did not appeal against the decisions referred to by the Government. However, he appealed against other decisions given in his case (see paragraphs 21, 24). He further initiated enforcement proceedings and asked the domestic courts to fine W.K. for failure to comply with the access arrangements (see paragraphs 28 and 32).\n42. Against this background, the Court concludes that the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust the national channels of redress. The Court accordingly dismisses the Government\u2019s objections.\n43. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n44. The applicant claimed that there had been a continuing violation of his right to respect for family life. On many occasions he had asked to be allowed to see his daughter without the presence of his former wife and the court-appointed guardian, however to no avail. He had repeatedly instituted several sets of proceedings aimed at providing him with the opportunity to have regular contacts with M. He further claimed that the child\u2019s mother had a negative influence on M. As a result, emotional ties between them loosened and he became in fact excluded from the process of bringing up his child. He concluded that there had been a violation of Article 8 in this respect.\n45. The Government stressed that the applicant was himself responsible for not achieving a deeper emotional contact with his daughter. Between October 1995 and October 1996 he had not participated in any meetings with his daughter. When the meetings finally took place he had insulted the child\u2019s mother.\n46. The Government pointed to the experts\u2019 opinion given in the domestic proceedings, according to which the applicant had a negative influence on his daughter. They stressed that the experts recommended limitation or suspension of the applicant\u2019s contacts with M. They submitted that despite the fact that the child had expressly stated that she did not wish to see her father, the public authorities maintained the applicant\u2019s right to continue to have contact with his child.\n47. They further stressed that when the mother had failed to comply with the court\u2019s decision of 9 March 2000 the Bedzin District Court had imposed a significant fine on her. Therefore, the steps taken by the courts to protect the applicant\u2019s rights were quick and efficient. The Government concluded that the authorities had done everything they could to protect the applicant\u2019s rights to respect his family life.\n48.

Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 April and 24 September 1993,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: AS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\n20. Dr Darnell complained that the length of the proceedings relating to the termination of his employment by Trent RHA constituted a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, according to which:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\nThis allegation was supported by the Commission and is no longer contested by the Government.\n21. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be determined with reference to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law and in the light of the circumstances of the case, which in this instance call for an overall assessment.\nIn view of the Government\u2019s concession that there has been a violation, the Court does not consider it necessary to rule on the dispute between the participants as to the starting date of the period to be taken into consideration in the present case. Even if the Court were to adopt the Government\u2019s position that, at the earliest, it should start to run from 10 August 1984, the date of the initial application to the Industrial Tribunal (see paragraph 15 above), the lapse of time of nearly nine years until the Employment Appeal Tribunal gave its reserved judgment on 8 April 1993 cannot, in the circumstances of the present case, be regarded as \u201creasonable\u201c.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\n### II.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 April 2004 and 11 July 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n##### 1. National Insurance\n11. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory national insurance (\u201cNI\u201d) contributions into the National Insurance Fund (NIF). This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n12. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA sets out the various classes of NI contribution. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NI scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NI contributions fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paras. 25-26).\n13. Primary Class 1 contributions to NI cease to be payable on attainment of the State retirement age (section 6(3) of the SSCBA).\n14. The NIF is currently the sole source of funding for payment of state retirement pensions as well as a number of other benefits, including IB. Topping up into the fund by way of Treasury Grant is possible in times of shortfall but has not occurred since 1997/1998.\n##### 2. Invalidity Benefit (IB)\n15. The Social Security (Incapacity for work) Act 1994 amended the 1992 Act so as to include provision for the payment of IB from April 1995. Section 1 provides, as relevant:\n\u201c... (1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, a person who satisfies either of the following conditions is entitled to short-term incapacity benefit in respect of any day of incapacity for work which forms part of a period of incapacity for work.\n(2) The conditions are that -\n(a) he is under pensionable age on the day in question and satisfies the contribution conditions specified for short-term incapacity benefit in Schedule 3, Part 1, paragraph 2;\n...\n(4) In any period of incapacity for work a person is not entitled to short-term incapacity benefit for more than 364 days.\n(5) Where a person ceases by virtue of subsection (4) above to be entitled to short-term incapacity benefit, he is entitled to long-term incapacity benefit in respect of any subsequent day of incapacity for work in the same period of incapacity for work on which he is not over pensionable age.\u201d\n16. IB is a contributory benefit funded out of NI contributions, designed to compensate a person for financial loss as a result of their inability to work due to ill-health or disability. It is therefore available throughout the assumed working life. As a result the period of entitlement is directly linked, for men and women, to the period of entitlement (if any) to receive the State retirement pension. When an individual reaches State pension age any entitlement to such a pension takes the place of IB. A full basic retirement pension pays GBP 77.45 per week, while the standard rate of IB is GBP 72.15.\n##### 3. State retirement pension\n17. At the relevant time, section 122 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 defined \u201cpensionable age\u201d as:\n\u201c(a) the age of 65, in the case of a man; and\n(b) the age of 60, in the case of a woman\u201d.\n18. Women in the United Kingdom therefore become eligible for a State pension at the age of 60, whereas men are not eligible until 65.\n19. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The State pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in the State pension age.\n#### C. European Union law\n20. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d.\n21. In its judgment in Case C-328/91 Thomas and Others [1993] ECR I-1247, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that where, pursuant to Article 7(1)(a), a Member State prescribed different pensionable ages for men and women for the purpose of granting old-age and retirement pensions the scope of the permitted derogation defined by the words \u201cpossible consequences thereof for other benefits\u201d was limited to the forms of discrimination existing under other benefits schemes which were necessarily and objectively linked to the difference in pensionable age. That was the position where such forms of discrimination were objectively necessary to avoid disturbing the financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure coherence between the retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes.\n22. In Case C-92/94 Secretary of State for Social Security v. Graham [1999] ECR I-2521, the ECJ considered the predecessor of IB, namely invalidity allowance and invalidity pension (both contributory benefits paid from NI contributions until pensionable age or until the cessation of any deferment in pension). It found that the measures were justified by both considerations of financial equilibrium and overall coherence and that the discrimination was necessarily linked to the difference in pensionable age for men and women, inter alia as invalidity benefit was designed to replace income from occupational activity and was replaced by a retirement pension at the age at which the recipients would in any event stop working.\n23. The derogation was not however held to justify pension-aged linked discrimination in a number of benefits e.g. in R. v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Taylor [1999] ECR I-8955, the ECJ held that the provision of winter fuel allowances for the elderly was not necessarily linked to the difference in the statutory age of retirement for men and women and in R. v. Secretary of State for Health ex parte Richardson [1995] ECR I-3407, the ECJ found that the discrimination in age entitlement to free prescriptions was not objectively justified to ensure coherence between the retirement pension system and the regulations concerning prescriptions and was not necessarily linked to the difference between pensionable ages for men and women.\n24. In Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security , ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (\u201cthe EOC case\u201d concerning a reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court relating to the differing contribution periods applicable to men and women determined according to pensionable age), the ECJ found that:\n\u2022 Article 7(1)(a) had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference;\n\u2022 Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age;\n\u2022 In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the Member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)(a) were to be interpreted restrictively.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\n25. The applicant complained that she had lost her entitlement to IB at age 60 whereas a man could continue to draw the benefit until age 65. The relevant provisions of the Convention provide:\nArticle 14 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n26. The applicant submitted that it was grossly unfair that she was worse off than a man in her position of the same age. The difference in benefit received was of considerable importance to her. She pointed to the Government\u2019s own White Paper on the subject which referred to the difference in State pension ages as \u201cthe last glaring inequality in the Government\u2019s treatment of men and women\u201d and to measures introduced by the European Union requiring equality of treatment in benefits. The change in the law which would take effect in 2020 would be far too late to benefit her. She disputed that the system favoured women as a whole, pointing out that men were able to enjoy a number of other benefits over the age of 60 even if in full-time employment (e.g. winter fuel allowance, free prescriptions). Men who were in receipt of IB over the age of 60 also had their NI contributions paid in full allowing them to contribute towards a higher State pension.\n27. In so far as the level of her State pension was lower than IB due to her incomplete contributions record, the applicant pointed out that this was because she had had four children over seven years and had to look after them for a number of years. She had been unaware, as she was sure most women were, that her subsequent contributions on return to work would not allow for a full State pension.\n##### 2. The Government\n28. The Government accepted that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 applied to the case and that Article 14 was applicable to any discrimination in relation to the availability of benefits such as the IB, funded from the NIF. They submitted that the differential age for men and women had, however, an objective and reasonable justification. They emphasised that the social, historic and economic basis for the provision of the State retirement pension, as well as the decision to equalise the age progressively from 2010-2020 involved complex social and economic judgments in respect of which the Government enjoyed a broad margin of appreciation. It was not a simple case of sex discrimination but involved issues of fair balance under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 where the Court had stated that it would respect the legislator\u2019s assessment in such matters unless it was devoid of reasonable foundation.\n29. The Government submitted that Parliament decided to", "001-67071": "\ufeff\nFIRST SECTION\nCASE OF PEDERSEN AND PEDERSEN v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Pedersen and Pedersen v. Denmark,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (First Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr C.L.

Nielsen, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n34. The applicants complained that the proceedings in their cases had exceeded a reasonable time, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, in so far as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ...any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal...\u201d\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n35. The Government maintained that based on an overall assessment and in the light of the specific circumstances of the cases, the criminal charges against the applicants were determined within a reasonable time as prescribed by Article 6 of the Convention. They agreed that the cases were uncomplicated as concerned the facts, but found that they were to some extent complex due to problems in law as well as procure. In this respect the Government referred inter alia to the involvement of EU-law issues, notably the question whether the relevant provision of the 1989 Act should have been notified to the European Commission and the question whether the cases should have been referred to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Moreover, the Government found that the applicants to a very considerable extent had been a contributory cause to the length of the proceedings. Finally, the Government maintained that it could not give rise to criticism that the city courts decided to adjourn the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the \u201ctest-cases\u201d as these decisions were reasonably motivated. All in all the Government found it inappropriate that the applicants on the one hand requested adjournments of the proceedings; extensions of time-limits for submission of pleadings; were unable to appear before court hearings before certain dates; raised questions of principles, including a request for a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice; requested an expert witness; and a special counsel assigned, and on the other hand claimed that the length of the proceedings were excessive.\n36. The applicants contested that the proceedings were complex. On the contrary, it was very simple cases and the only unusual initiative was the request to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The latter, however, had been of crucial relevance and the applicants could not be blamed for making use of remedies available under Danish law. Furthermore, the applicants found that there were several periods of unacceptable inactivity during the proceedings for which only the Government were to blame, including the delay caused by the applicants\u2019 claim that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority. In any event the applicants found that the duration of the proceedings before the Supreme Court had been excessive. Two other factors had caused an unreasonable delay of the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 opinion; the adjournment of their cases pending the outcome of corresponding cases and the lack of resources in the Danish court system. Finally, the applicants pointed out that they had not in any way been compensated for the lengthy proceedings e.g. by having been imposed a more mitigating sentence.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n37. As regards the alleged breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it is undisputed that the proceedings as to the first applicant commenced on 20 October 1992, and as to the second applicant on 26 October 1993. The proceedings ended on 16 February 2001 when the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. Thus, the total length of the proceedings, which the Court must assess under Article 6 \u00a7 1, was eight years, three months and twenty\u2011seven days; and seven years, three months and twenty-two days; respectively.\n38. According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed in the light of the particular circumstances of the case and having regard to the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case\u2011law, in particular the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the authorities before which the case was brought (cf. P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC] no.25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n(a) Complexity of the case\n39. The Court notes that it was not in dispute that the proceedings were uncomplicated as concerned the facts. Reiterating that the first applicant before the High Court requested that an expert witness be heard; that both applicants before the Supreme Court requested that an additional counsel be assigned to plead on the EU-law issues of the case; and that the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submit written replies to various questions put by counsel as regards EU issues, the Court considers that certain features as to law and procedure were to some extent complex and time\u2011consuming.\n(b) Conduct of the applicants\n40. The Court reiterates that only delays attributable to the State may justify a finding of failure to comply with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement (e.g. Humen v. Poland, no. 26614/95, \u00a7 66, 15 October 1999). It notes that the applicants do not appear to have been very much involved in the procedural disputes during the proceedings concerned. However, it follows from the case-law that they are nevertheless to be held responsible for the possible delays caused by their representatives (see amongst others Capuano v. Italy, judgment of 25 June 1987, Series A no. 119, \u00a7 28; A. and Others v. Denmark, judgment of 8 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, \u00a7 74); and mutatis mutandis Stanford v. the United Kingdom judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 282-A, \u00a7 28).\n41. The Court observes that the first applicant, being represented by counsel, agreed to an adjournment of his trial before the City Court from December 1993 until September 1995, in order to await the outcome of a pending corresponding case, in which a defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority as it contravened articles of the Penal Code and provisions of the Environmental Protection Act. The first applicant agreed to a second adjournment of his trial from December 1995 until the autumn of 1996, in order to await the outcome of another pending corresponding case, in which the defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC. Accordingly, the first applicant did not at any time during the proceedings before the City Court object to the fact that his trial was adjourned with almost three years in order to await the outcome of so-called \u201ctest-cases\u201d.\n42. As regards the second applicant, the Court reiterates that, being represented by counsel, he agreed to an adjournment of his trial before the City Court with approximately one year from September 1994 until October 1995 in order to await the outcome of a pending corresponding test\u2011case.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Inheritance tax\n12. By sections 3, 3A and 4 of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984 (\u201cthe 1984 Act\u201d), inheritance tax is charged at 40% on the value of a person's property, including his or her share of anything owned jointly, passing on his or her death, and on lifetime transfers made within seven years of death. The charge is subject to a nil rate threshold of GBP 275,000 for transfers between 5 April 2005 and 5 April 2006; GBP 285,000 for transfers during the tax year 2006-2007; and GBP 300,000 for 2007-2008 (section 98 of the Finance Act 2005).\n13. Interest is charged, currently at 4%, on any tax not paid within six months after the end of the month in which the death occurred, no matter what caused the delay in payment. Any inheritance tax payable by a person to whom land is transferred on death may be paid, at the tax-payer's election, in ten equal yearly instalments, unless the property is sold, in which case outstanding tax and interest must be paid immediately (1984 Act, section 227(1)-(4)).\n14. Section 18(1) of the 1984 Act provides that property passing from the deceased to his or her spouse is exempt from charge. With effect from 5 December 2005, this exemption was extended to a deceased's \u201ccivil partner\u201d (see paragraphs 16-18 below).\n#### B. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (\u201c2004 Act\u201d)\n15. The purpose of the 2004 Act was to provide same-sex couples with a formal mechanism for recognising and giving legal effect to their relationships, and to confer on them, as far as possible, the same rights and obligations as entailed by marriage.\n16. A couple is eligible to form a civil partnership if they are (i) of the same sex; (ii) not already married or in a civil partnership; (iii) over the age of 16; (iv) not within the prohibited degrees of relationship.\n17. A civil partnership is, like marriage, indeterminate in nature and can end only on death, dissolution or annulment. The 2004 Act created a comprehensive range of amendments to existing legislation, covering inter alia pensions, tax, social security, inheritance and immigration. The courts have similar powers to control the ownership and use of the civil partners' property upon dissolution of a civil partnership as upon dissolution of a marriage.\n18. When the Civil Partnership Bill was passing through Parliament, an amendment to it was passed in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 130, which would have had the effect of extending the availability of civil partnership, and the associated inheritance tax concession, to family members within the \u201cprohibited degrees of relationship\u201d, if (i) they were over 30 years of age; (ii) they had co-habited for at least 12 years; and (iii) they were not already married or in a civil partnership with some other person. The amendment was reversed when the Bill returned to the House of Commons.\n19. During the course of the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Alli, a Labour Peer, stated:\n\u201cI have great sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady O'Caithlin [the Conservative Peer who proposed the amendment], when she talks about siblings who share a home or a carer who looks after a disabled relative. Indeed, she will readily acknowledge that I have put the case several times\u2014at Second Reading and in Grand Committee\u2014and I have pushed the Government very hard to look at this issue. There is an injustice here and it needs to be dealt with, but this is not the Bill in which to do it. This Bill is about same-sex couples whose relationships are completely different from those of siblings.\u201d\nDuring the same debate, Lord Goodhart, Liberal Democrat Peer, stated:\n\u201cThere is a strongly arguable case for some kind of relief from inheritance tax for family members who have been carers to enable them to continue living in the house where they have carried out their caring duties. But that is a different argument and this is not the place or the time for that argument. This Bill is inappropriate for dealing with that issue.\u201d\nDuring the course of the debate in the Standing Committee of the House of Commons, Jacqui Smith MP, Deputy Minister for Women and Equality, stated:\n\u201cAs I suggested on Second Reading, we received a clear endorsement of the purpose of the Bill\u2014granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, ensuring that the many thousands of couples living together in long-term committed relationships will be able to ensure that those relationships are no longer invisible in the eyes of the law, with all the difficulties that that invisibility brings.\nWe heard a widespread agreement from Members across almost all parties that the Civil Partnership Bill is not the place to deal with the concerns of relatives, not because those concerns are not important, but because the Bill is not the appropriate legislative base on which to deal with them.\u201d\n#### C. The Human Rights Act 1998 (\u201cthe 1998 Act\u201d)\n20. The 1998 Act entered into force on 2 October 2000. Section 3(1) provides:\n\u201cSo far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\u201d\nSection 4 of the 1998 Act provides (so far as relevant):\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility. ...\n(6) A declaration under this section ... -\n(a) does not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the provision in respect of which it was given; and\n(b) is not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it is made.\u201d\nSection 6 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an act if -\n(a) as a result of one or more provisions of primary legislation, the authority could not have acted any differently; or\n(b) in the case of one or more provisions of ... primary legislation which cannot be read or given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights, the authority was acting so as to give effect to or enforce those provisions. ...\u201d\nSection 10 of the 1998 Act provides:\n\u201c(1) This section applies if \u2013\n(a) a provision of legislation has been declared under section 4 to be incompatible with a Convention right and, if an appeal lies \u2013\n(i) all persons who may appeal have stated in writing that they do not intend to do so; or\n(ii) the time for bringing an appeal has expired and no appeal has been brought within that time; or\n(iii) an appeal brought within that time has been determined or abandoned; or\n(b) it appears to a Minister of the Crown or Her Majesty in Council that, having regard to a finding of the European Court of Human Rights made after the coming into force of this section in proceedings against the United Kingdom, a provision of legislation is incompatible with an obligation of the United Kingdom arising from the Convention.\n(2) If a Minister of the Crown considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding under this section, he may by order make such amendments to the legislation as he considers necessary to remove the incompatibility.\u201d\n21. The Government submitted that the objective of giving the national courts the power under section 4 had been to provide a formal means for notifying the Government and Parliament about a situation in which legislation was found not to comply with the Convention, and to provide a mechanism for speedily correcting the defect. Once a declaration had been made (or once the European Court of Human Rights had found a violation based on a provision of domestic law), there were two alternative avenues for putting right the problem: either primary legislation could be introduced in Parliament, or the Minister concerned could exercise his summary power of amendment under section 10 of the 1998 Act.\n22. When the Human Rights Bill passed through the House of Lords on 27 November 1997, the Lord Chancellor explained that:\n\u201cwe expect that the government and Parliament will in all cases almost certainly be prompted to change the law following a declaration of incompatibility.\u201d\nOne of the Ministers with responsibility for the 1998 Act explained to the House of Commons on 21 October 1998 that:\n\u201cOur proposals [for remedial orders] safeguard parliamentary procedures and sovereignty, ensure proper supervision of our laws and ensure that we can begin to get the ability both to enforce human rights law and to create a human rights culture. They also ensure that we can do it in the context of not having to worry that if something is decided by the Strasbourg court or by our courts that creates an incompatibility, we do not have a mechanism to deal with it in the quick and efficient way that may be necessary.\u201d\nThe most recent report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, published on 4 August 2006, showed that declarations of incompatibility had been made in twenty cases between December 2000 and December 2004. In seven of these cases the declaration had been overturned on appeal, or the judgment on appeal was pending. In ten cases the offending legislation had been amended or repealed (in one case by a remedial order), and in the remaining three cases, amendments to the offending legislation were pending or under consideration.\nTHE LAW\n23. The applicants complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention, that when one of them died, the survivor would face a significant liability to inheritance tax, which would not be faced by the survivor of a marriage or a civil partnership. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE APPLICATION\n24. The Government contested the admissibility of the application on a number of grounds under Articles 34 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Article 34 provides:\n\u201cThe Court may receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. ... \u201d\nArticle 35 \u00a7 1 states:\n\u201cThe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.\u201d\n#### A. The applicants' victim status\n25. The Government submitted that the complaint was prospective and hypothetical, because no liability to inheritance tax had yet accrued, and might never accrue. The present applicants could not, therefore, claim to be \u201cvictims\u201d of any violation, and their complaint represented a challenge to the tax regime in abstracto, which the Court could not entertain.\nThe present case was on that ground distinguishable from Marckx v. Belgium, judgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, where the applicants had been complaining about certain provisions of Belgian law that applied automatically to the illegitimate child and her mother, and Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, where the complaint concerned rights of inheritance where the parent had already died. In contrast, the requirement to pay inheritance tax did not apply automatically. The applicants were not so affected by the risk of a future liability to tax as to bring them into a comparable position to the applicants in Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1982, Series A no. 48, where the Court found that a threat of inhuman and degrading punishment could in itself breach Article 3 of the Convention, or Norris v. Ireland, judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, where the existence of criminal sanctions for homosexual acts must necessarily have affected the applicant's daily conduct and private life.\n26. The applicants responded that it was all but inevitable that one of them would predecease the other, and similarly certain that the value of the deceased's estate would exceed the nil rate threshold for inheritance tax (see paragraph 13 above). Thus, as in Marckx (cited above), or Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, both of which concerned complaints about the effect of illegitimacy on succession rights under domestic law, the applicants ran a very high risk of a violation of their Convention rights. Even before either had died, the legislation had an impact on them, as it affected their choices about disposing of their property. They had \u201can awful fear\u201d hanging over them that the house would have to be sold to pay the tax, and they should not have to wait until one of them died before being able to seek the protection of the Convention.\n27. The Court recalls that under Article 34 of the Convention it may receive applications from individuals and others \u201cclaiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto\u201d. In order to claim to be a victim of a violation, a person must be directly affected by the impugned measure (see, for example, Cornwell v. the United Kingdom, no. 36578/97, decision of 11 May 1999).\n28. It is true that neither of the applicants is, at the present time, under an obligation to pay inheritance tax, since no such liability can arise until one of them dies. However, the sisters are aged 88 and 81 respectively. The property owned by each far exceeds the current nil-rate band for inheritance tax. The Court agrees with the applicants that, from the present perspective, it appears virtually certain that one of them will in the not too distant future be required to pay substantial inheritance tax on the property inherited from her sister. In this respect the present case is closer to Marckx than to, for example, Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7 49, ECHR 2002-IV, where the Court found the applicant's complaint about discrimination concerning the future non-payment to him of a Widow's Pension or equivalent to be \u201chypothetical\u201d, because of the lack of certainty that the applicant would satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlement by the time he reached the age at which a woman in his position would be eligible to apply.\n29. The Court concludes, therefore, in the light of the applicants' advanced age and the very high probability that one will be liable to pay inheritance tax upon the death of the other, that they can claim to be directly affected by the impugned law. It follows that the Court rejects the first of the Government's objections to the admissibility of the application.\n#### B. Domestic remedies\n30. The Government further contended in the alternative that, if the applicants had an arguable complaint under the Convention, they could and should have brought a claim for a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act (see paragraph 21 above).\n31. The applicants were both currently alive and neither had yet incurred any liability to inheritance tax. Since no pecuniary loss had been suffered, the Court could not make a pecuniary award in their favour, and would, at most, make a declaration that there had been a violation of the applicants' Convention rights. If a declaration by this Court would constitute just satisfaction for any breach of the applicants' rights, a declaration of incompatibility by the High Court should similarly be regarded as an effective remedy.\n32. The Government argued that, consistently with the Court's approach and with the generally accepted principles of international law, they did not have to demonstrate either (i) that an application for a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act would necessarily have succeeded, or (ii) that provisions on inheritance tax in the 1984 Act would necessarily have been amended in any identified manner within any specific time period, even if a declaration of incompatibility were made. It was sufficient, for Article 35 \u00a7 1 to be engaged, that there was an available domestic remedy with a realistic prospect of success which the applicants had failed to pursue.\n33. They noted that in Hobbs v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 63684/00, 18 June 2002, the Court had found that, in the circumstances of that case, a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act was not sufficiently certain to be capable of providing redress, such as to require exhaustion by the applicant, on the grounds that: (i) a declaration of incompatibility is not binding on the parties to the litigation; (ii) the Minister has a power, but not a duty, to amend the relevant legislation; and (iii) the Minister could exercise his power to change the law only if there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for so doing. Hobbs, however, was a decision on its particular facts and could not be regarded as authority for any general proposition that a declaration of incompatibility under section 4 of the 1998 Act would never be capable of providing an effective remedy. In particular, the applicant in Hobbs had already suffered a financial disadvantage for which he was seeking monetary compensation. The present application was different because neither applicant had yet suffered any financial disadvantage. Moreover, the decision in Hobbs had inevitably been based on the extremely limited evidence and submissions then before the Court. Since the Court had now been provided with more information about the domestic law, in particular the ministerial statements set out in paragraph 23 above, it was both possible and appropriate for it to revisit its previous decision.\n34. The applicants referred to the Commission's case-law to the effect that the remedies an applicant is required to make use of must not only be effective but also independent of discretionary action by the authorities (for example, Montion v. France, no. 11192/84, Commission decision of 14 May 1987, Decisions and Reports (DR) 52, p. 227 and G. v. Belgium, no. 12604/86, Commission decision of 10 July 1991, DR 70, p. 125). They argued that a declaration of incompatibility could not be regarded as an effective remedy because the procedures to change the law could not be initiated by those who had obtained a declaration or enforced by any court or organ of State. The Court had accepted a similar argument in Hobbs and also in Dodds v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 59314/00, 8 April 2003, Walker v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 37212/02, 16 March 2004, Pearson v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 8374/03, 27 April 2004 and, finally, B. and L. v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 36536/02, 29 June 2004, where the Government had made submissions almost identical to those in the present case.\n35. The Court is very much aware of the subsidiary nature of its role and that the object and purpose underlying the Convention, as set out in Article 1\u2014that rights and freedoms should be secured by the Contracting State within its jurisdiction\u2014would be undermined, along with its own capacity to function, if applicants were not encouraged to pursue the means at their disposal within the State to obtain available redress (see the B. and L. decision, cited above). The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention thus obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, no. 21893/93, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, Reports 1996-IV; Aksoy v. Turkey, no. 21987/93, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI).\n36. The Government argue that the remedy under the Human Rights Act allowing an applicant to seek a declaration from a domestic court that legislation is incompatible with the Convention is sufficiently certain and effective for the purposes of Article 35 \u00a7 1. Such a declaration creates a discretionary power in the relevant government minister to take steps to amend the offending provision, either by a remedial order or by introducing a Bill in Parliament.\n37. The Court found in its Hobbs decision (cited above) that this remedy was not sufficiently effective, essentially for two reasons: first, because a declaration was not binding on the parties to the proceedings in which it was made; and, secondly, because a declaration provided the appropriate minister with a power, not a duty, to amend the offending legislation by order so as to make it compatible with the Convention. Moreover, the minister concerned could exercise that power only if he considered that there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for doing so.\n38. The Court considers that the instant case is distinguishable from Hobbs, where the applicant had already suffered financial loss as a result of the discrimination about which he complained but could not have obtained monetary compensation through the grant of a declaration of incompatibility. It is closer to B. and L., where there had been no financial loss, although those applicants had already been prevented by the impugned legislation from marrying each other. In the present case, as in B. and L., it is arguable that, had a declaration of incompatibility been sought and made, the applicants might have been able to benefit from a future change in the law.\n39. However, it remains the case that there is no legal obligation on the minister to amend a legislative provision which has been found by a court to be incompatible with the Convention. The Court notes that, according to the information provided by the Government, by August 2006 such amendments had occurred in ten out of the thirteen cases where a declaration had been finally issued by the courts, and in the remaining three, reforms were pending or under consideration (see paragraph 23 above). It is possible that at some future date evidence of a long-standing and established practice of ministers giving effect to the courts' declarations of incompatibility might be sufficient to persuade the Court of the effectiveness of the procedure. At the present time, however, there is insufficient material on which to base such a finding.\n40. The Court does not consider that these applicants could have been expected to have exhausted, before bringing their application to Strasbourg, a remedy which is dependent on the discretion of the executive and which the Court has previously found to be ineffective on that ground.\nIt therefore rejects the Government's second objection to admissibility.\n#### C. Delay\n41. In the alternative, the Government submitted that the application was inadmissible under the six-months rule. The discrimination of which the applicants complained arose when an exemption for spouses was first introduced by the Finance Act 1975, and it first impacted on the applicants when they began co-habiting.\n42. The applicants contended that the violation about which they complained, arising out of legislative measures, was continuing, so that the six-months time-limit did not apply (see Norris, cited above). Further and in the alternative, the discrimination has intensified since the coming into force of the 2004 Act on 5 December 2005.\n43. The Court repeats that it has found the applicants to be directly affected by a provision of domestic law, given the high probability that it will automatically apply to the survivor following the first sister's death. In these circumstances and since there is no domestic remedy which the applicants can be required to exhaust, the six-months time-limit does not apply.\n#### D. The Court's conclusion on admissibility\n44. The Court considers that the application as a whole raises questions of law which are sufficiently serious that their determination should depend on an examination of the merits. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established. The application must therefore be declared admissible. Pursuant to Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, the Court will now consider the merits of the applicants' complaint.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n#### A. The parties' submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n45. The Government emphasised that there was no right under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to acquire possessions; in the Court's case-law on domestic inheritance laws, it had consistently held that, before the relevant death occurred, the presumptive heir had no property rights and that his or her hope of inheriting in the event of death could not therefore amount to a \u201cpossession\u201d (see Marckx, \u00a7 50; and also Inze v. Austria, judgment of 28 October 1987, Series A no. 126, \u00a7 38; Mazurek v. France, no. 34406/96, \u00a7\u00a7 42-43, ECHR 2000-II).

The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; and Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n9. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n10. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n11. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n12. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WMA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n13. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n14. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n#### B.

By Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Journal on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished.\nTHE LAW\n### I. THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\n33. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s representative was not duly authorised to introduce the application on behalf of the applicant before the Court and the application should therefore be declared inadmissible ratione personae. In particular, they indicated that the authority form of 15 July 2004 did not contain the representative\u2019s signature.\n34. The applicant contested that argument. He noted that he had signed an authority form for Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent his interests before the Court. He further maintained that Mr A. Cang\u0131 had been representing him since the early stages of the proceedings and that he had not received any instructions from the Court concerning the validity of the submitted authority form.\n35. The Court observes that on 4 August 2004 the applicant\u2019s representative signed and submitted a complete application form on behalf of the applicant along with a power of attorney filled in and signed by the applicant himself.\n36. In these circumstances the Court considers that, by providing the Court with the power of attorney authorising Mr A. Cang\u0131 to represent him before the Court, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that he wished Mr A. Cang\u0131 to make an application to the Court on his behalf. It therefore finds that the present application cannot be rejected as incompatible ratione personae pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention, and dismisses the Government\u2019s objection.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n37. The applicant complained that he had not received a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the presence of a military judge sitting on the bench of the \u0130zmir State Security Court. He further alleged under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention that the \u0130zmir State Security Court had sentenced him on the basis of statements obtained in his absence, which he could not challenge during the proceedings against him and that, despite his requests, the court had not heard any witnesses in his favour.\nArticle 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention, insofar as relevant, provide:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. Independence and impartiality of the State Security Court\n39. The Government submitted that the applicant had been convicted by a State Security Court which had been composed of three civilian judges since the military judge had been replaced before the end of the proceedings. They further maintained that the majority of the proceedings had been conducted by civilian judges and the military judge had not been involved in important interlocutory decisions during the time he served on the bench. The Government finally argued that following the replacement of the military judge, at the hearing of 15 July 1999 the contents of the case\u2011file had been read out to the applicant and the applicant had accordingly been provided with the opportunity to make additional defence submissions.\n40. The applicant maintained his allegations. He argued, in particular, that the \u0130zmir State Security Court had not repeated the acts in which the military judge had participated when the latter was replaced by a civilian judge.\n41. The Court has consistently held that certain aspects of the status of military judges sitting as members of the state security courts rendered their independence from the executive questionable (see \u0130ncal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011IV, \u00a7 68; and \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, Judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998\u2011VII, \u00a7 39). The Court also found in the \u00d6calan v. Turkey case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 114-115) that, when a military judge participated in one or more interlocutory decisions that continued to remain in effect in the criminal proceedings concerned, the military judge\u2019s replacement by a civilian judge in the course of those proceedings before the verdict was delivered, failed to dissipate the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about that trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality, unless it was established that the procedure subsequently followed in the state security court sufficiently allayed that concern.\n42. In the instant case, the Court notes that before his replacement on 15 July 1999, the military judge was present at twelve hearings on the merits. During these hearings, the first-instance court received the statements of another co-accused concerning the applicant\u2019s involvement in the offence and admitted F.A.\u2019s statements into the case file as evidence. The court also carried out some minor procedural acts.\n43. After the replacement of the military judge by a civilian judge, the \u0130zmir State Security Court held twenty-two more hearings on the merits within the course of four years, during which the final submissions of both the public prosecutor and the applicant were taken.\n44. The Court acknowledges that the case was evaluated by three civilian judges for the most part. However, it also observes that the main evidence, consisting of the statements of B.\u04e6. and those made by F.A. during another set of proceedings, was evaluated by the court during the initial stages of the proceedings, in the presence of the military judge. The bench composed of three civilian judges did not take any new decision as regards the admissibility of F.A.\u2019s statements, nor did it order to a re-hearing of B.\u04e6.\n45. In these circumstances, the Court considers that the replacement of the military judge before the end of the proceedings failed to dispose of the applicant\u2019s reasonably held concern about the trial court\u2019s independence and impartiality (see Aslan and \u015eanc\u0131 v. Turkey, no. 58055/00, 5 December 2006).\n46. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n##### 2. Alleged unfairness of the proceedings\n47. Having regard to the facts of the case and its finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention above and referring to paragraph 52 below, the Court concludes that it is not necessary to make a separate ruling on the merits of the applicant\u2019s remaining complaint under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention concerning his inability to challenge th", "001-76453": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF KEEGAN v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 28867/03)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n18 July 2006\nFINAL\n18/10/2006\nIn the case of Keegan v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nJosep Casadevall, President,\nNicolas Bratza,\nGiovanni Bonello,\nMatti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4,\nKristaq Traja,\nLjiljana Mijovi\u0107,\nJ\u00e1n \u0160ikuta, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 October 2005 and 27 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n21. Section 17 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides for entry and search without a search warrant:\n\u201c(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section ..., a constable may enter and search any premises for the purpose\u2013\n...\n(b) of arresting a person for an arrestable offence;\n...\u201d\n22. Police can also apply to the magistrates\u2019 court for a warrant. The grant of a warrant is subject to the safeguards in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 15 provides, inter alia, that the constable must state the ground on which he makes the application and the enactment under which the warrant would be issued; specify the premises to be entered and searched; and identify in so far as practicable the articles or persons sought. Applications are made ex parte and supported by an information in writing. The constable must answer on oath any question put to him by the Justice of the Peace or judge. There is no statutory requirement for the court issuing the warrant to make findings or give reasons for issuing the warrant.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n23. The applicants complained of the forcible entry by the police to search their home, relying on Article 8 of the Convention which provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his home ....\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society ... for the prevention of disorder or crime ...\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n24. The applicants asserted that the circumstances in which the police had entered their house and the fact that domestic law permitted that constituted a breach of Article 8. The applicants had contested in the domestic proceedings that the police had been relying on their power under section 17 of the 1984 Act, in respect of which there was no prior judicial control, and, in any event, whether that was the case or not, there was no possibility of bringing a claim for trespass against police officers who entered while in possession of a valid warrant or any possibility of obtaining damages without showing malice on the part of the police. They emphasised that the domestic courts had found that there had been no reasonable and probable cause for obtaining the warrant and it followed that the information supplied to the officers effecting the entry must also have been defective.\n25. The applicants made reference to the lack of judicial supervision of the procedure, drawing attention to the significant gap of time between the alleged offences and the date on which the warrant was obtained and then executed, and submitted that it was clear that there was considerable information which showed that the suspected robber did not live at their address and that they did. Furthermore, they argued that the link between the cash proceeds of the robbery and premises possibly linked to Dean Metcalfe was slight, and that neither was there any urgency preventing recourse to other methods of investigation.\n26. The applicants submitted that the condition of malice was too restrictive a condition in relation to rights as important as the security of the home. It was not the case that every unsuccessful search disclosed a breach of Article 8, but they urged that the proper balancing safeguard should be the consideration of whether there was reasonable and probable cause for the warrant. It was irrelevant that the police executing the warrant acted in good faith as the warrant was sought without adequate investigation.\n##### 2. The Government\n27. The Government submitted that the principles to be found in domestic law struck the right balance between the public interest in the investigation of crime and the rights of those individuals who sought to pursue a private remedy against the police. They argued that the arrest and gathering of evidence against suspects was often difficult, even dangerous, and the courts had to be careful not to impede investigators in the course of their legitimate duties. The absence of a requirement of malice would impose liability for negligence and potentially expose chief constables to the possibility of civil action on almost every occasion when warrants were obtained. The fact that a search proved to be unsuccessful did not in itself give rise to a cause of action. Primary protection was given to a person\u2019s rights in regard to invasion of property by the requirement that a search be on a warrant granted by a judicial officer who must be satisfied that there was reasonable cause. They relied on judicial dicta that this judicial supervision was not merely a rubber stamp, because it was not sufficient for the judge to be satisfied by the officer\u2019s oath that he believed the grounds for the warrant; the cause for the belief also had to appear reasonable to the judge. Further, the grant of warrants was subject to procedural conditions set out in domestic law, warrants could be quashed in proceedings for judicial review, and where the police acted maliciously, they would be liable in damages.\n28. Accordingly, while the Government accepted that the entry and search fell within the scope of protection afforded by Article 8, the measure was justified in the circumstances of the case and by the fact that there were adequate and effective safeguards against abuse. They emphasised that the police were engaged in an investigation into serious criminal offences; there were reasonable grounds to arrest Dean Metcalfe; it was known that he had access to firearms and it was at the very least undesirable to give any warning of entry; the police officer who applied for the warrant genuinely and reasonably believed that stolen cash was on the premises; and the Justice of the Peace was so satisfied on information given on oath. They submitted that it was inherent in any investigation process that circumstances change and errors could arise; however, it was not the case that every change of circumstance should give rise to liability.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n29. It is not disputed that the forcible entry by the police into the applicants\u2019 home interfered with their right to respect for their home under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and that it was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d on a domestic level and pursued a legitimate aim \u2013 the prevention of disorder and crime \u2013 as required by the second paragraph of Article 8. What remains to be determined is whether the interference was justified under the remaining requirement of paragraph 2, namely whether it was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve that aim.\n30. According to the Court\u2019s settled case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a \u201cpressing social need\u201d and in particular that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see, for example, Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1), 24 March 1988, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 130). The Court must accordingly ascertain whether, in the circumstances of the case, the entry into the applicants\u2019 home struck a fair balance between the relevant interests, namely their right to respect for their home, on the one hand, and the prevention of disorder and crime, on the other (see McLeod v. the United Kingdom, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 53, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VII).\n31. While a certain margin of appreciation is left to the Contracting States, the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 8 are to be interpreted narrowly and the need for measures in a given case must be convincingly established (see Funke v. France, 25 February 1993, \u00a7 55, Series A no. 256\u2011A). The Court will assess in particular whether the reasons adduced to justify such measures were relevant and sufficient and whether there were adequate and effective safeguards against abuse (see, for example, Buck v. Germany, no. 41604/98, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, ECHR 2005-IV).\n32. Turning to the present case, the Court recalls that domestic law and practice regulates the conditions under which the police may obtain entry to private premises, either with or without a warrant. In the present case, the police obtained a warrant from a Justice of the Peace, giving information under oath that they had reason to believe the proceeds of a robbery were at the address which had been used by one of the suspected robbers. No doubt was cast, in the domestic proceedings or before the Court, on the genuineness of the belief of the officers who obtained the warrant or those who executed it. If this belief had been correct, the Court does not doubt that the entry would have been found to have been justified.\n33. However, the applicants had been living at the address for about six months and they had no connection whatsoever with any suspect or offence. As the County Court Judge noted, it is difficult to conceive that enquiries were not made by the police to verify who lived at the address the suspected robber had been known to give and that if such enquiries had been properly made (via the local authority or utility companies), they would not have revealed the change in occupation. The loss of the police notes renders it impossible to deduce whether it was a failure to make the proper enquiries or a failure to transmit or properly record the information obtained that led to the mistake that was made. In any event, as found by the domestic courts, although the police did not act with malice and indeed with the best of intentions, there was no reasonable basis for their action in breaking down the applicants\u2019 door early one morning while they were in bed. Put in Convention terms, there might have been relevant reasons but, as in the circumstances they were based on a misconception which could, and should, have been avoided with proper precautions, they cannot be regarded as sufficient (see, mutatis mutandis, McLeod, cited above, where the police did not take steps to verify whether the applicant\u2019s ex-husband had the right to enter her house, notwithstanding his genuine belief, and did not wait until her return).\n34. The fact that the police did not act maliciously is not decisive under the Convention, which aims to protect against abuse of power, however motivated or caused (see, mutatis mutandis, McLeod, cited above, where the police suspected a breach of the peace might occur). The Court cannot agree that limiting actions for damages to cases of malice is necessary to protect the police in their vital function of investigating crime. The exercise of powers to interfere with home and private life must be confined within reasonable bounds to minimise the impact of such measures on the personal sphere of the individual guaranteed under Article 8 which is pertinent to security and well-being (see, for example, Buckley v. the United Kingdom, 25 September 1996, \u00a7 76, Reports 1996\u2011IV). In a case where basic steps to verify the connection between the address and the offence under investigation were not effectively carried out, the resulting police action, whi", "001-92767": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SZULUK v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. The Secretary of State is responsible for the management of the prison system in England and Wales (Prison Act 1952, sections 1 and 4).\n23. Until November 2007 each prison was required to appoint a medical officer (Prison Act 1952, section 7(1)). The medical officer was a prison officer who had to be a registered medical practitioner (Prison Act 1952, section 4). This requirement was removed by section 25(1) of the Offender Management Act 2007 which came into force on 1 November 2007. Prison health care is now generally integrated with, and commissioned by, the National Health Service (NHS).\n24. Section 47(1) of the Prison Act 1952 authorises the Secretary of State to make rules for the regulation and management of prisons and for the classification, treatment, employment, discipline and control of persons required to be detained therein. Such rules are made by statutory instrument, laid before Parliament, and are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (Prison Act 1952, section 52(1) and the Criminal Justice Act 1967, section 66(4)).\n25. Prisoners are classified in accordance with directions of the Secretary of State (Prison Rules SI 1999/728 rule 7(1)). Prisoners are classified in accordance with PSO 0900. Paragraph 1.1.1 of PSO 0900 contains the definitions of the four categories of prisoner (A, B, C and D). Category A is applied to prisoners whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or the police or the security of the State, no matter how unlikely that escape might be, and for whom the aim must be to make escape impossible. Category B is applied to prisoners for whom the very highest conditions of security are not necessary, but for whom escape must be made very difficult.\n26. Rule 34 of the Prison Rules is headed \u201cCommunications Generally\u201d It provides as relevant:\n\u201c(1) Without prejudice to sections 6 and 19 of the Prison Act 1952 and except as provided by these Rules, a prisoner shall not be permitted to communicate with any person outside the prison, or such person with him, except with the leave of the Secretary of State or as a privilege under rule 8.\n(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, and except as otherwise provided in these Rules, the Secretary of State may impose any restriction or condition, either generally or in a particular case, upon the communications to be permitted between a prisoner and other persons if he considers that the restriction or condition to be imposed \u2013\n(a) does not interfere with the Convention rights of any person; or\n(b) (i) is necessary on grounds specified in paragraph (3) below;\n(ii) reliance on the grounds is compatible with the Convention right to be interfered with; and\n(iii) the restriction or condition is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved.\n(3) The grounds referred to in paragraph (2) above are \u2013\n(a) the interests of national security;\n(b) the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime;\n(c) the interests of public safety;\n(d) securing or maintaining prison security or good order and discipline in prison;\n(e) the protection of health or morals;\n(f) the protection of the reputation of others;\n(g) maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary; or\n(h) the protection of the rights and freedoms of any person.\n...\n(8) In this rule \u2013\n...\n(c) references to Convention rights are to the Convention rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998.\u201d\n27. Rule 39 of the Prison Rules deals with correspondence with legal advisers and courts and provides that such correspondence may only be opened, read or stopped by the prison governor in accordance with the provision of that rule, namely when the governor has cause to believe either that the correspondence contains an illicit enclosure or that its contents endanger prison security or the safety of others or are otherwise of a criminal nature.\n28. Chapter 36.1 of PSO 1000, which was applicable at the relevant time and which dealt with prisoner communications in connection with those who were in Category A prisons, or who were in prisons which held Category A prisoners, provided as follows:\n\u201cPrison management must provide facilities for prisoners to maintain contact with family and friends. Prisoners\u2019 rights to respect for their private and family life and correspondence are also protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Prison Service\u2019s duty to protect the public allows us to interfere in this privacy in order to minimise the possibility that, in communicating with the outside world, prisoners:\n(i) plan escapes or disturbances;\n(ii) jeopardise the security and good order of the prison;\n(iii) engage in offences against criminal law or prison discipline;\n(iv) jeopardise national security;\n(v) infringe the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n29. Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000 read:\n\u201cAll correspondence, other than correspondence protected by PR39 [that is correspondence with legal advisors] or that with the Samaritans, must be read as a matter of routine in the following cases:\n(i) all prisoners of whatever security category, held in a unit which itself holds Category A prisoners.\u201d\n30. Chapter 36.22 continued as follows:\n\u201cRoutine reading is necessary in these cases in order to prevent escape and, in the case of Category A prisoners, in the interests of public safety. It is also necessary in preventing crime and disorder, for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and, in some cases, necessary in the interests of national security or the economic well being of the country.\u201d\n31. PSO 4411 is entitled \u201cPrisoner Communications: Correspondence\u201d. It came into operation on 5 September 2007. So far as is material to the present case it reflects the practice and procedure in operation from 2002 to 2004.\n32. Special treatment was at the relevant time and still is given to various forms of correspondence apart from that with legal advisers, specifically covered by rule 39 of the Prison Rules and that with the Samaritans, specifically mentioned in Chapter 36.21 of PSO 1000. Correspondence with, inter alia, the courts, the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors, the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner, the Office of the Legal Services Ombudsman, the Probation Ombudsman, the Commission for Racial Equality and MPs are generally treated as confidential.\n33. PSO 4411 introduced a new category of correspondence subject to confidential handling arrangements. Chapter 5.1 includes the Healthcare Commission as one of the bodies with which a prisoner is entitled to correspond confidentially. The Healthcare Commission is the independent watchdog for health care in England. It assesses and reports on the quality of services provided by the NHS and the independent health-care sector.\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n34. Chapter III, paragraph 34 of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) standards published in October 2006 states the following:\n\u201cWhile in custody, prisoners should be able to have access to a doctor at any time, irrespective of their detention regime ... The health-care service should be so organised as to enable requests to consult a doctor to be met without undue delay.\nPrisoners should be able to approach the health-care service on a confidential basis, for example, by means of a message in a sealed envelope. Further, prison officers should not seek to screen requests to consult a doctor.\u201d\n35. Paragraph 50 of the CPT standards provides:\n\u201cMedical secrecy should be observed in prisons in the same way as in the community. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained that the prison authorities had intercepted and monitored his medical correspondence in breach of Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n37. The Government contested that argument.\n#### A. Admissibility\n38. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n39. The Government accepted that the checking of the applicant\u2019s correspondence with his external medical specialist amounted to an interference with his right to respect for his correspondence under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n40. Relying on the judgment of the Court of Appeal (particularly its findings set out in paragraph 19 above), the Government submitted that the interference was justified and proportionate under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. They argued that the applicable legal framework provided clear and structured guidance on the matter, which paid full regard to the requirements of the Convention. They asserted that the procedure devised was tailored to the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case. Moreover, the disclosure of the applicant\u2019s medical correspondence was limited to the prison medical officer who was himself bound by duties of medical confidentiality. They distinguished the present case, which involved a circumscribed reading of a single category of a prisoner\u2019s correspondence by the prison medical officer, from cases which involved a blanket reading of prisoners\u2019 correspondence (such as Petra v. Romania, 23 September 1998, \u00a7 37, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VII, and Jankauskas v. Lithuania, no. 59304/00, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22, 24 February 2005) which had been held to be in breach of Article 8 of the Convention.\n41. The applicant argued that the monitoring of his correspondence was disproportionate. There was no suggestion in the Government\u2019s observations of any specific ground to suggest that he was likely to abuse correspondence with his medical specialist. PSO 4411, to which the Government referred as being the policy governing correspondence, recognised that prisoners could correspond on a confidential basis with a number of bodies including the Healthcare Commission (which considered complaints concerning medical treatment) and the Samaritans (who provided counselling for the suicidal). According to PSO 4411, such correspondence could only be opened where there were reasonable grounds to believe that it contained an illicit enclosure.\n42. The applicant further contended that there was an obvious risk that monitoring of medical correspondence would inhibit what a prisoner conveyed, thereby harming the quality of advice received. It was such concerns that had led to legal correspondence being accorded confidentiality. PSO 4411 demonstrated that prison security was not undermined by enabling prisoners to write on a confidential basis to lawyers and other professionals such as the Healthcare Commission. It was difficult to see why the risk of abuse of correspondence with doctors should be any higher than the risk of abuse involved in correspondence with lawyers.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n43. The Court notes that it is clear, and indeed not contested, that there was an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d with the exercise of the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence guaranteed by Article 8 \u00a7 1. Such an interference will contravene Article 8 unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and is \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d in order to achieve them (see, among other authorities, Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, \u00a7 84, Series A no. 61; Campbell v. the United Kingdom, 25 March 1992, \u00a7 34, Series A no. 233; Petrov v.

It further observes that it is accepted by the parties that the reading of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was governed by law and that it was directed to the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (see paragraph 17 above). The issue that falls to be examined is whether the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d.\n45.

Traja, Judges,\nand Mrs S. doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 September 1999,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 are set out in the judgment of the Court in the above-cited Findlay case (at pp. 272-276, \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n11. Central to the system under the 1955 Act was the role of the \u201cconvening officer\u201d. This officer (who had to be of a specified rank and in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court-martial. He or she had the final decision on the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court-martial required, and was responsible for convening the court-martial.\n12. The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint. Failing the appointment of a judge advocate by the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Office, the convening officer could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\n13. Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer\u2019s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it. He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \u201creasonably requested\u201d by the defence.\n14. The convening officer could dissolve the court-martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice. In addition, he could comment on the proceedings of a court-martial. Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case, where a more public instruction was required in the interests of discipline, they could be made known in the orders of the command.\n15. The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also. A court-martial\u2019s findings were not effective until confirmed by the confirming officer, who was empowered to withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.\n16. Since the applicants\u2019 trials, the law has been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see the above-cited Findlay v. the United Kingdom judgment, at p. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 52-57).\n17. Section 69 of the Army Act 1955 provides that any person subject to army law who is guilty of any conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline shall, upon conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or any less punishment for which the 1955 Act provides.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. Each of the applicants complained, invoking Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, that he did not have a fair or public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Article 6 \u00a7 1, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination \u2026 of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing \u2026 by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. \u2026\u201d\nA Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n19. The Court notes the potential penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment (in Mr Smith\u2019s case) and the sentence imposed on Mr Ford (six months\u2019 imprisonment) together with the nature of the charges of which, in particular, Mr Ford was found guilty. It considers that the applicants\u2019 court-martial proceedings involved the determination of charges of a criminal nature within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, for example, the Garyfallou AEBE v. Greece judgment of 24 September 1997, Reports 1977-V, no. 49, p. 1830, \u00a7\u00a7 32-33, with further references).\n#### B. Independence and impartiality of the applicants\u2019 courts-martial\n20. The applicants mainly argued that their courts-martial were not independent or impartial and that the proceedings against them were consequently unfair. The Government made no observations on the admissibility of the case except to note that it raised issues similar to those in respect of which the Court had found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in ", "001-90575": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF THORNE v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n9. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt and WMA, constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility of the application\n11. The Government submitted that the Department of Work and Pensions had no trace of a claim ever having been made by the applicant, nor any form of other documentation evidencing the receipt of the application for benefits. Consequently, it did not appear that the applicant ever made a claim and therefore, according to the Court\u2019s established case-law, he was not a victim of the alleged violation.\n12. The applicant submitted that although the Department of Work and Pensions had lost all the documents related to his case, and they had admitted this, this did not mean that he had never claimed such benefits. He submitted to the Registry of the Court a copy of his personal diary which showed a note stating that he had introduced his claim on 2 March 2001. Moreover, he submitted a copy of the rejection letter from the benefits agency dated 28 June 2001.\n13. The Court considers that for the purposes of the present case the applicant has sufficiently proved that he made a formal application to the benefits agency. It will further consider that such claim had been made on 2 March 2001 and therefore within the domestic time-limits for claiming both benefits. Consequently, the application is not incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention or the Protocols thereto.\n14. The Court further finds that the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, nor inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n15. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of WMA refers solely to the period between the date of his wife\u2019s death and 8 April 2001.\n16. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n17.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Widow's Pensions 1925-2001\n15. The following history of the Widow's Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) is taken from Lord Hoffmann's speech in R. v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ex parte Hooper and Others [2005] UKHL 29, paragraphs 18-30:\n\u201c[WP was] first introduced by the Widows', Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pension Act 1925. The Act provided a pension of 10 shillings a week to any widow whose husband had paid sufficient contributions. There was no age qualification or time limit on payment. Widows were as such entitled to support. But during the Second World War, large numbers of women worked in the armed forces or civilian employment, replacing men on active service. Public attitudes to widowhood changed. Sir William Beveridge said in his 1942 Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd 6404, paragraph 153) that there was no reason why a childless widow should get a pension for life. If she was able to work she should do so. He recommended that all widows should be paid a 13 week transitional allowance to help them adjust to their new circumstances but that longer term pensions should be confined to widows with dependent children. The Government did not accept this advice in full. It considered that an older widow, who had in accordance with convention stayed at home during a long marriage to look after husband and children, would often be severely disadvantaged if she was required to earn her own living. The National Insurance Act 1946 therefore not only gave effect to Beveridge's recommendations by introducing [Widowed Mother's Allowance: 'WMA'] and a widow's allowance for 13 weeks after bereavement but also provided WP for widows who were over 50 at the date of the husband's death or who ceased to qualify for WMA when they were over 40.\nThe secular trend in the position of women in employment over the next half century reinforced Beveridge's view that being a widow should not, as such, entitle one to a pension. More and more women entered the labour market. But the trend was a slow one and crude comparisons of the numbers of economically active men and women are misleading. Far more women than men worked part-time and the great majority of women were (and remain) unable to escape from the traditional low-paid activities of cooking, caring and cleaning. So the trend to equality was counteracted by political pressure from groups representing widows who claimed that, as the United Kingdom became more prosperous, benefits for widows should be increased rather than reduced. The policies pursued by successive governments were therefore not entirely consistent. The Family Allowances and National Insurance Act 1956 raised to 50 the age at which a woman could claim WP after ceasing to be entitled to WMA. On the other hand, the National Insurance (Old persons' and widows' pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 reduced to 40 the age at which WP would be payable (at a reduced rate), whether as a result of bereavement or the cessation of WMA.\nIn 1985 the government published a Green Paper on Social Security Reform which pointed out (in paragraph 10.9) that the current system of benefits dated from days when far fewer married women worked:\n'Today two thirds of all married women with children over school age, and over a half of widows between 40 and 60, go to work. The present pattern of benefits nonetheless provides support without regard to widows' other income, in many cases long after they have ceased to be responsible for bringing up children. The Government's view is that it is right to give greater emphasis to providing for widows of working age who have children to support, and for older widows less able to establish themselves in work.'\nDespite this acknowledgement of changes in social conditions, the Social Security Act 1986 made relatively modest adjustments to the system. The 26 week transitional widow's allowance was abolished and the lump sum [Widow's Payment: 'WPt'] of \u00a31,000 substituted. The age at which WP became payable, whether on bereavement or cessation of WMA, was raised to 45 and entitlement to the full rate postponed until 55. These provisions were subsequently consolidated in the 1992 Act.\nThe 1986 changes were opposed by a strong lobby on behalf of widows. But no one suggested in the course of the Parliamentary debates that WP should be extended to men. It is true that Cruse, a non-governmental organisation for 'the widowed and their children', which had taken widowers on board in 1980, said in their 1986-87 annual report:\n'We ... continued to press for a widower's pension, based on his wife's national insurance contributions, and for an allowance to be paid to widowed fathers.'\nBut this pressure does not appear to have persuaded anyone to raise the question of WP for widowers in Parliament. The first serious suggestion that widowers should in principle be paid the same benefits as widows came from the European Commission. There had been a Council Directive 79/7/EEC in 1978 on 'the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security' which expressly excluded survivors' benefits. In 1987 the Commission produced a proposal for a new Directive (Com (87) 494 Final). It drew attention in an explanatory memorandum to a statement of the Court of Justice in Razzouk and Beydoun v Commission of the European Communities (Cases 75/82 and 117/82), [1984] ECR 1509, 1530, para 16 (a case concerning survivors' pensions under the Community's own Staff Regulations) that the principle of equal treatment of men and women 'forms part of the fundamental rights the observance of which the court has a duty to ensure.' Article 4 of the draft Directive provided that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex in the payment of survivorship benefits:\n'and to this end:\n(a) either the recognition on the same terms for widowers of entitlement to the pensions and other benefits provided for widows;\n(b) or the replacement of widows' benefits by the creation or extension of a system of individual rights open to all surviving spouses regardless of sex.'\nThe House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities (Sub-Committee C) held an inquiry into the proposal in 1989. Miss Joan C. Brown, a writer on social security matters, said in evidence to the Committee that there was no case for paying older widowers the same pensions as older widows. The only way to produce equality was to level down. But hasty action would cause real hardship to large numbers of older widows who had chosen many years earlier to follow the conventional path of staying home to look after husband and children:\n'the effect of earlier social patterns on women still have to be worked through. This suggests the need to phase out the older widow's pension over a long period\u2014in the order of 10-15 years. Without this, there would be a serious risk of poverty among older widows who had followed the social norms of their day and now find themselves at a severe disadvantage in a changed world as a result.'\nThe Select Committee accepted Miss Brown's evidence and reported (Session 1988-89, 10th Report, HL Paper 51):\n'In the United Kingdom...there might be reluctance to reproduce for widowers the pension a childless widow can receive under the national insurance scheme, irrespective of her earnings, if she is aged 45 or more when her husband dies. This is in recognition of the difficulty the widow may find in re-establishing herself in the labour market\u2014whereas a widower's earning ability would not ordinarily be prejudiced in this way.\nThe Committee consider that, despite these difficulties, the concept of equal treatment must require that, eventually, men and women should be provided with survivors' benefits on the same terms. Employment patterns are changing and, if it becomes the norm for married couples to be dependent on the earnings of both partners for most of their working lives, it will make sense for equal survivors' benefits to be available. There is also a need to avoid putting families at a disadvantage if the mother, rather than the father, becomes the principal breadwinner. It would, however, be perverse to deprive widows of benefits they still need in the interests of sex equality. To reduce this danger, a substantial period should be allowed\u2014at least 15 years\u2014before Member States are obliged to equalise survivors' benefits. Community law recognises a principle of 'legitimate expectation' which would support this approach.'\nThe Government published its response on 4 April 1990 (Cm 1038). It said at para 15:\n'Within the state social security system the Government do not think there is any merit in introducing a universal state insurance benefit for widowers on a par with those currently provided for widows. To extend the current provisions for widows to widowers would cost about \u00a3350 million a year. The available evidence indicates that widowers are more likely to be in full time work than widows, are more likely to have higher earnings than widows and are less likely to have dependent children. As a consequence the Government have made it clear to the Commission that the equalisation of survivors' benefits should be removed from this draft directive entirely.'\nIn 1991 the Commission withdrew the draft directive pending further consultation with Member States and there has been no further European Union initiative on the question.\n...[O]ver the next few years the question of paying WMA to widowed fathers was raised on more than one occasion (see, for example, a Private Member's Bill introduced by Mr Hartley Booth MP on 13 April 1994 (Hansard HC Debates (6th Series) vol 241, cols 212-213) and a Written Answer by the Secretary of State for Social Security (Hansard HC Deb (6th Series) vol 255, 1 March 1995, col 621)). No one suggested paying WP to widowers or, unsurprisingly, abolishing WP for widows. Cruse said in evidence in these proceedings that Mr Hartley Booth's decision to confine his Private Member's Bill to WMA was 'tactical' but the need for such tactics suggests that there would have been little support for anything more.\nThe abolition of WP came as part of a wider reform of survivorship and other social security benefits in the 1999 Act. It was preceded in 1998 by a Consultation Paper which drew attention to the fact that, in 1995, 7 out of 10 married women worked compared with 1 in 8 in 1946. Half of widows under 60 worked and 47% of widows now had income from occupational pension schemes. The Government took the view that widows without dependent children no longer needed long term support. The extension of WP to men was 'not acceptable': it would cost another \u00a3250 million a year and would mean giving help to people who were, as a class, unlikely to need it.\nBut the abolition of WP was strongly opposed by some members of Parliament, partly on the ground that elderly widows were still disadvantaged compared with men or younger widows and partly on the ground that WP was a contributory benefit and that it would be a breach of faith to deny it to the widows of men who had made contributions and arranged their affairs on the assumption that it would be available. An opposition amendment deferring the abolition of WP until 2020 was defeated but the Government agreed that the changes should not come into force until 9 April 2001 and that the rights of women bereaved before that date should be preserved.\u201d\n#### B. WP under the Social Security and Benefits Act 1992\n16. Under Section 38 of the 1992 Act, a woman who had been widowed was entitled to a WP if her husband satisfied the contribution conditions set out in a Schedule to the Act; and\n(i) at the date of her husband's death she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65; or\n(ii) she ceased to be entitled to a WMA at a time when she was over the age of 45 (40 for deaths occurring before 11 April 1988), but under the age of 65.\n17. This benefit was not payable for any period after the widow remarried or in which she and a man to whom she was not married were living together as husband and wife, or for any period in which she was entitled to a WMA.\n#### C. The position from 9 April 2001\n18. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) came into force on 9 April 2001. Section 54 introduced the Bereavement Payment which replaced the Widow's Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001. Section 55 introduced the Widowed Parent's Allowance. Identical conditions applied as for Widowed Mother's Allowance, except that the new allowance was available to (i) widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001 and who were under pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) at the time of the spouse's death, and (ii) widowers whose wife died before 9 April 2001, who had not remarried and were still under pensionable age on the that day.\n19. Section 55 replaced WP with a Bereavement Allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the spouse's death, where no dependent children existed. The deceased spouse had to have satisfied the relevant contribution conditions and died on or after 9 April 2001. The Bereavement Allowance is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement, but is not payable for any period after the survivor reaches pensionable age or remarries or lives with another person as husband and wife, or for any period for which the survivor was entitled to Widowed Parent's Allowance.\n20. Widows (but not widowers) whose husbands died before 9 April 2001, and who fulfilled the other conditions of entitlement, continued to be eligible for WP.\n#### D. Other survivors' benefits under the 1992 and 1999 Acts\n21. For details of the relevant legislative provisions, see Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 14 November 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 29-35 and 38-40.\n#### E. The House of Lords' judgment in Hooper and Others\n22. On 5 May 2005 the House of Lords delivered a unanimous judgment (cited in paragraph 15 above), in which it found, inter alia, that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards WP from 2 October 2000 (when the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force) onwards was objectively justified and involved no breach of Convention rights.\n23. Lord Hoffmann, with whom the other Law Lords agreed, observed that WP had, for reasons of administrative economy, never been means-tested, but had been paid to older widows because it was thought that, as a class, they were likely to be disadvantaged because it had been the custom for women to give up work when they got married. The same did not apply to widowers. The question was not, therefore, whether there was justification for not paying WP to men, but rather whether there was justification for not having moved faster in abolishing its payment to women. The history of WP (set out in paragraph 15 above) demonstrated that the decision to achieve equality between men and women by levelling down survivors' benefits, subject to vested rights, was by no means easy or obvious. It was true that by 2000 the proportion of older women (50-59) who were \u201ceconomically active\u201d was 65.9% against 72.5% for men. But those figures had to be adjusted to reflect greater part-time working by women (44% as against 9%) and the concentration of women in low-paid occupations. The comparative disadvantage of women in the labour market had by no means disappeared.\n24. It was permissible under Article 14 of the Convention for States to treat groups unequally in order to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between them, and the State enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in determining social and economic policy. Once it was accepted that older widows were historically an economically disadvantaged class which merited special treatment but were gradually becoming less disadvantaged, the question of the precise moment at which such special treatment was no longer justified was a matter of legislative judgment.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION AND/OR ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\n25.

De Gaetano,\nPaul Mahoney, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 9 April 2013,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The United Kingdom\n##### 1. General provisions on voting in parliamentary elections\n7. Section 1(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d) provides that a person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if on the date of the poll he is, inter alia, registered in the register of parliamentary electors for a constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. Pursuant to section 4(1), a person is entitled to be registered if on the relevant date he is, inter alia, resident in the constituency and is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.\n##### 2. Provisions regarding persons with a service qualification\n8. Sections 14-17 of the 1983 Act allow certain categories of persons otherwise eligible to vote who do not fulfill the normal residence requirements to continue to register to vote by making a \u201cservice declaration\u201d. A service declaration can be made by a person who is (a) a member of the forces, (b) employed in the service of the Crown in a post outside the United Kingdom of any prescribed class or description, (c) employed by the British Council in a post outside the United Kingdom, or (d) the spouse or civil partner of a person falling within categories (a), (b) or (c) above.\n9. Section 17 provides that where a person\u2019s service declaration is in force, he shall be regarded for the purposes of section 4 of the 1983 Act as a resident on the date of the declaration at the address specified in it (current or former address in the United Kingdom).\n##### 3. Provisions regarding overseas voters\n(a) Current legislation\n10. Section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1985 as amended (\u201cthe 1985 Act\u201d) provides that a person who is a British citizen is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election if he qualifies as an overseas elector on the date on which he makes an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d (see paragraph 14 below). A person qualifies as an overseas elector if he is not resident in the United Kingdom and he satisfies one of the sets of conditions set out in the legislation.\n11. The relevant set of conditions for the purpose of the present case is set out in section 1(3):\n\u201cThe first set of conditions is that\u2014\n(a) he was included in a register of parliamentary electors in respect of an address at a place that is situated within the constituency concerned,\n(b) that entry in the register was made on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at that address,\n(c) that entry in the register was in force at any time falling within the period of 15 years ending immediately before the relevant date [i.e. the date on which the applicant makes a declaration under section 2], and\n(d) subsequent to that entry ceasing to have effect no entry was made in any register of parliamentary electors on the basis that he was resident, or to be treated for the purposes of registration as resident, at any other address.\u201d\n12. Section 2(1) provides that a person is entitled to be registered pursuant to an \u201coverseas elector\u2019s declaration\u201d in the constituency where he was last registered to vote or last resided and the registration officer concerned is satisfied that he qualifies as an overseas elector in respect of that constituency. Where the entitlement of a person to remain registered as an overseas voter terminates, the registration officer concerned shall remove that person\u2019s entry from the register (section 2(2)).\n13. Section 2(3) requires that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration state the date of the declaration, that the declarant is a British citizen, that the declarant is not resident in the United Kingdom, and the date on which he ceased to be so resident.\n14. Section 2(4) stipulates that an overseas elector\u2019s declaration must show which set of conditions in section 1 of the Act the declarant claims to satisfy and, in the case of the first set of conditions, specify the address in respect of which he was registered.\n(b) History to the current legislation\n15. Prior to the enactment of the 1985 Act, no British citizen living overseas could vote in a parliamentary, i.e. general, election in the United Kingdom, other than members of the armed forces or Crown servants.\n16. In 1982 a parliamentary committee, the Home Affairs Select Committee, published a report on the Representation of the People Acts which recommended that British citizens living in what were then Member States of the European Economic Community should be able to vote in parliamentary elections for an indefinite period. The Government\u2019s response to that report recommended a seven-year limit for all overseas voters, expressing the view that a person\u2019s links with the United Kingdom were likely to have weakened significantly if he had lived outside it for as long as ten years.\n17. The 1985 Act as originally enacted extended the right to vote to British citizens resident overseas but who had been resident in the United Kingdom within the previous five years. The bill originally proposed a seven-year period but concerns were expressed during the passage of the bill that that period was both too long and too short. Further concerns regarding the inability of a straightforward time-limit to reflect the positions and intentions of individuals regarding their contact with the United Kingdom were also raised.\n18. The five-year period was extended to twenty years by virtue of section 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1989. The bill which led to the Act was prepared following consultation and proposed increasing the time-limit to twenty-five years. During parliamentary debates, the Secretary of State acknowledged that there was no correct answer as to where the correct cut-off point lay and explained that a balance had to be struck between the interests of those who, although resident abroad for some time, had retained close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom and those who had \u201ccut adrift\u201d from such links much earlier. Parliamentarians expressed a broad spectrum of views, with some opposing any change which would allow those resident abroad for long periods to vote and others arguing that restrictions on the right to vote should be kept to a minimum.\n19. Section 1 of the 1989 Act was subsequently repealed and replaced, with retention of the twenty-year period, by section 8 and Schedule 2 of the Representation of the People Act 2000.\n20. In September 1998 the Home Affairs Select Committee published a report on Electoral Law and Administration. It proposed that the period during which overseas voters be permitted to vote be reduced. The relevant extract of its report reads:\n\u201c113. The Representation of the People Act 1985 introduced a right for British citizens resident overseas on the qualifying date to register as a voter for parliamentary and European elections for up to five years following their move overseas. This period was increased to twenty years under the Representation of the People Act 1989. The peak year for actual registrations under the Act was in 1991 when 34,500 registered; the numbers have steadily decreased since then until a rise in 1997, when the total stood at 23,600, followed by a further fall in 1998 to 17,300. Estimates of the potential number who could register have ranged as high as three million.\n114. It has been suggested that it is unreasonable for people who have been away for so long to retain the right to vote. Professor Blackburn argued that the system meant that \u2018an expatriate living hundreds or thousands of miles away, for the duration of a period exceeding a whole generation, carrying memories of British politics in the past and with little or no personal knowledge of contemporary issues in the constituency where he or she used to live, can influence the election of the government of a country to which he is not subject and to whom he or she may be paying no taxes\u2019. Electoral administrators pointed out that there were costs attached to registering overseas citizens and that a shorter period might be cheaper and easier to operate. The Labour Party and Liberal Democrat representatives both suggested that 20 years was perhaps too long. Professor Blackburn suggested that the right to vote while overseas might be related in some way to the nature of the links retained with the UK or to an intention to return.\n115. On the other hand, it is clear that the present rules \u2013 with so few persons actually registering \u2013 cause very little disruption or distortion to the actual results and, for the Labour Party, Mr Gardner indicated that changing the time limit was not a priority issue. It must also be likely that those who do register are those with the greater commitment to events in the UK and are those most likely to be planning to return. A further restraining factor is that overseas voters have to vote by proxy (because it is not possible to send a ballot paper overseas reliably in the time available) which means that in order to exercise their right to vote they have to establish some form of connection with their former home. The Home Office reported that most of the correspondence they received on this issue was not from people calling for the twenty year period to be lowered but from people who had been resident overseas for more than twenty years arguing for it to be increased.\n116. On balance, we take the view that the twenty year maximum period within which a British citizen overseas may retain the right to vote is excessive and that the earlier limit \u2013 five years \u2013 should be restored.\u201d (emphasis in original; references omitted)\n21. The twenty-year period was subsequently reduced to fifteen years pursuant to section 141(a) of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The bill preceding the Act proposed a reduction to ten years. During parliamentary debates, the relevant Government minster explained that the proposed ten-year period struck a balance between the various strongly-held views expressed. During the bill\u2019s passage through the House of Lords, the Government minister proposed an increase to fifteen years in response to concerns aired during the debate. While the minister accepted that the amendment represented a broad-brush approach, he considered it to be the most equitable approach that could be adopted.\n(c) Recent legislative and policy developments\n22. On 6 May 2009, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009, an amendment was proposed to raise the period for overseas voting from fifteen to twenty years. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe first is that we live in an era of increasing globalisation and internationalisation of economic activity, a process which has gathered pace since the reduction of the qualifying period in 2000. Secondly, we need to reflect the different nature of modern society and the mobility of populations. Thirdly, I seek to reflect the fact of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union.\u201d\n23. The Government minister defended the fifteen-year period, noting the absence of any compelling argument or evidence that would justify a change. He considered that the focus should be instead on raising the registration rate of overseas voters, noting that fewer than 13,000 overseas voters were registered in England and Wales as of 1 December 2008. The amendment was not passed.\n24. During a short debate in the House of Lords on 2 March 2011 regarding voting arrangements for overseas electors, some members called on the Government to reconsider the fifteen-year period. Attention was drawn to the fact that those who worked abroad for international organisations did not have the same voting rights as members of the armed forces, Crown servants and employees of the British Council, who were not subject to the fifteen-year limit. The Government minister acknowledged that the Government ought to address the issue of overseas votes, noting that of an estimated 5.5 million British citizens resident abroad, only about 30,000 actually voted.\n25. On 27 June 2012, during the passage through Parliament of the bill which led to the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, an amendment was proposed in the House of Commons to remove the fifteen-year rule. The reasons for the proposed amendment were explained as follows:\n\u201cAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 5.6 million British citizens currently live abroad. The shocking truth is that although, as of last December, about 4.4 million of them were of voting age, only 23,388 were registered for an overseas vote, according to the Office for National Statistics\u2019 electoral statistics. Out of 4.4 million potential overseas voters, only 23,000-odd are actually registered! ...\n...\nIn most other countries, both developed and emerging, voting rights for parliamentary elections depend solely on nationality, not on an arbitrary time limit. For example, US nationals can vote in presidential, congressional and state elections, regardless of where they reside in the world. Similarly, Australian nationals can vote in the equivalent elections there, no matter where they live. However, the most startling example comes from our nearest neighbour. French citizens in the UK have just elected a new President and taken part in parliamentary elections for one of the 11 Members of Parliament whose job it is solely to represent French people abroad ....\nThe right of Spaniards abroad to vote is enshrined in article 68 of the Spanish constitution. ...\n...\n[A]ll Portuguese citizens living abroad have the same right to vote in Assembly elections as fellow citizens living in their home country. The simple fact is that the citizens of the US, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and all these other countries have better voting rights for their citizens abroad than we do for British citizens living abroad.\nFor a democracy as ancient as ours, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a stain on our democratic principles that our citizens are placed at such a disadvantage when they have moved abroad compared with citizens from those other countries. Her Majesty\u2019s Government is very happy to collect tax from most of the enormous number of people involved, but denies them the vote.\u201d\n...\n\u201cThe states in which these British citizens reside do not allow them to vote as residents, because voting rights are based on nationality and not residence, and they cannot vote in the UK on the basis of the current rule, for which there is no obvious rationale. I challenge the Deputy Leader of the House to state where there would be any disadvantage in abolishing the rule. The consequence of the rule is that many British citizens living abroad are in a state of electoral limbo, unable to participate in any election whatsoever. That seems to be a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.\u201d\n26. The Government minister replied that the Government would give the issue \u201cserious consideration\u201d. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn.\n27. A similar amendment to the bill was proposed at the Committee stage in the House of Lords on 14 January 2013. The reasons given for the proposed amendment were as follows:\n\u201cThe fundamental issue at stake here is the complete exclusion of so many British citizens living abroad for more than 15 years from the right to vote here. According to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 55% of those who moved abroad in 2008 did so for work-related reasons, 25% for study and 20% for life in retirement. With an ageing population, and increased opportunities for work and study abroad, people are likely to continue to leave the United Kingdom in substantial numbers. Many of them will reside abroad for more than 15 years. In the countries to which they move, voting rights rest overwhelmingly on nationality, not residence. Apart from some nine Commonwealth countries \u2013 mainly islands in the West Indies \u2013 I understand that no state permits British citizens to vote in its principal national elections. They therefore exist in an electoral limbo.\n...\nWithin the European Union, Britain compares unfavourably with most of its partners. Of the 27 EU members, 22 countries allow their expatriate citizens the right to vote, without any restriction on the period of residence outside the home country. That is apart from Germany, which restricts it to 25 years for expatriates living outside the EU. Just two countries, Denmark and the United Kingdom, restrict the period for voting rights: the UK to 15 years and Denmark to four. In three countries \u2013 Cyprus, the Republic of Ireland and Malta \u2013 expatriates have no right to vote.\nThe world has become much smaller. Britons overseas can listen to our radio via their computer, they can watch British television and read British newspapers just as rapidly as anyone living here, if they subscribe to them electronically. I make a confident prediction that this debate in our House today will attract one of the largest television online audiences abroad that your Lordships have had. I have met many British overseas residents who are as well, if not better, informed about British political affairs than the average voter here. So the old argument about expatriates\u2019 inability to make an informed judgment about the great issues in our political life no longer holds.\u201d\n28. The Government minister responded that the question whether the time limit was appropriate was a wider question which remained under consideration within Government. He noted that there were valid arguments on both sides which needed to be carefully considered alongside any practical issues before any informed decisions could be taken. The amendment was withdrawn but it was subsequently reintroduced on 23 January 2013 during the Report stage of the bill, with further debate taking place. Again, the Government minister indicated that the issue was under consideration by Government and the amendment was withdrawn.\n(d) Judicial review proceedings in Preston ([2011] EWHC 3174 (Admin) and [2012] EWCA Civ 1378)\n29. On 1 December 2011, the High Court handed down judgment in the case of Preston v Wandsworth Borough Council and Lord President of the Council. The claimant was a long-term resident of Spain who sought judicial review of the fifteen-year rule under section 1(3) of the 1985 Act. He argued that he had a directly effective right under European Union law to move to and reside in other Member States and that the fifteen-year rule operated unjustifiably to interfere with the exercise of that right.\n30. The court found that there was no evidential basis for the contention that the fifteen-year rule created a barrier of any kind to free movement. The matter therefore did not fall within the scope of EU law. That being so, the issue of justification did not arise. The court nonetheless indicated that it considered the rule to be a proportionate interference with the right to free movement. It was of the view that the Government were entitled to hold that there was a legitimate objective which the rule was designed to achieve, namely to remove the right to vote from those whose links with the United Kingdom had diminished and who were not, for the most part at least, directly affected by the laws passed there. It observed:\n\u201c44. ... [T]he 15 year rule is designed to establish a test to identify when the absence of residence can fairly be said to have diluted the link with the UK sufficient to justify the removal of the right to vote. The fact that some residence tests do not properly or proportionately measure the strength of commitment does not mean that the adoption of a non-residence test cannot legitimately measure the weakening of commitment. This rule does not fix on non-residence at some particular point in time; it requires a consistent period of non-residence. In my judgment that is a justified way to measure the dilution of commitment. Thereafter the choice of a bright line rule is inevitable. It would in my view be wholly impracticable to adopt a rule which required consideration of the personal circumstances of all potential expatriate voters ...\u201d\n31. The court found that decisions of this Court upholding residence rules were \u201chighly material\u201d (referring to Hilbe v. Liechtenstein (dec.), no. 31981/96, ECHR 1999\u2011VI; Melnychenko v. Ukraine, no. 17707/02, \u00a7 56, ECHR 2004\u2011X; and Doyle v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 30158/06, 6 February 2007).\n32. Finally, the court considered that the exceptions to the fifteen-year period for certain categories of citizens were justified as the individuals concerned were resident in other States at the request of the United Kingdom in order to look after its national interests.\n33. In its judgment of 25 October 2012, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the High Court on both the question of the existence of an interference with free movement rights and the question of justification. Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment for the court and, on the latter issue, noted in particular:\n\u201c89. First, the Divisional Court was entitled to hold ... that the 15 year rule had a legitimate aim, i.e. to test the strength of a British citizen\u2019s links with the UK over a significant period of time by measuring past commitment to the UK and seeing whether it was sufficiently diminished or diluted to justify removal of the right to vote in parliamentary elections. That aim was legitimate for the purpose of confining the parliamentary franchise to those citizens with an ascertainable, continuing, close and objective connection with the UK, whose government made decisions and whose Parliament passed laws that most directly affected those British citizens resident in the UK.\n90. Secondly, the residence of a citizen is not ... an arbitrary measure of connection with a country: far from it, residence is a relevant, rational and practicable criterion for assessing the closeness of the links between a British citizen and the UK.\n91. Thirdly, the 15 year rule is proportionate to the aim. The length of the period represents three Parliamentary terms. It provides a substantial opportunity for continued voting by British citizens who have moved to reside in another EU country.\n92. Fourthly, it is impracticable for the franchise criteria to be other than bright line rules capable of reasonably consistent practical application. It would be unworkable and disproportionate for the electoral authorities to have to make individual merits assessments of the particular circumstances of each resident in another EU country on a case-by-case basis in order to determine how close a connection there is between that particular individual and the UK despite prolonged absence.\n93. Fifthly, there is no objectionable inconsistency of treatment arising from the excepted categories of overseas residents, such as members of the armed services and Crown employees. In general, they do not move to reside overseas as a voluntary exercise of the right to free movement ... [T]heir circumstances are distinguishable from those of the claimant and others who, like him, have chosen, for their own personal reasons, to live in another Member State.\u201d\n#### B. Italy\n34. A foreign national may acquire Italian citizenship after having been resident in Italy and enrolled in the register of the population of a municipality for four years in the case of nationals of European Union Member States. Citizenship may also be acquired after two years of marriage to an Italian citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted.\n35. A foreign national wishing to acquire Italian citizenship must pay a fee of 200 euros plus a notarial fee of around 15 euros. Application forms are available on the website of the Ministry of Interior. An oath of allegiance to the Italian Republic must be sworn.\n36. All Italian citizens are entitled to vote in Italian parliamentary elections (unless excluded for such things as conviction for certain offences etc.).\n### III. RELEVANT COUNCIL OF EUROPE MATERIAL\n#### A. The Parliamentary Assembly\n37. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (\u201cthe Assembly\u201d) has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations regarding migration issues, including implications for the right to vote.\n38. In 1982 it adopted Recommendation 951 (1982) on voting rights of nationals of Council of Europe member states. The recitals to the recommendation read, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Noting that an estimated 9 million nationals of Council of Europe member states do not reside in their country of origin, but in some other member state of the Council;\n2. Considering that these citizens cannot normally take part in elections or referenda held in their country of residence because they are not nationals of that country;\n3. Noting that many of them are also unable, under national legislation, to take part from the territory of their country of residence in elections and referenda held in their country of origin because they have no domicile there;\n...\n5. Considering that millions of nationals of Council of Europe member states are thereby deprived of all civic rights;\n6. Mindful that one of the major concerns of the Council of Europe is to preserve and strengthen democracy and civic rights in member states;\n7. Emphasising the importance it attaches to the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and the First Protocol thereto, particularly freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, as well as the obligation for member states to hold free elections at regular intervals ;\n8. Believing that steps should, therefore, be taken to ensure that every national of a member state is able to exercise his political rights, at least in his country of origin, when he resides in another Council of Europe member state ...\u201d\n39. The Assembly recommended, inter alia, that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201cc. consider the possibility of harmonising member states\u2019 laws in the interests of maintaining the voting rights of their nationals living in another member state with regard to nation-wide elections and referenda, especially with a view to enabling votes to be cast by post or through diplomatic or consular missions;\nd. envisage, if appropriate, the drawing up of a protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights whereby member states would undertake to respect such voting rights for their nationals living in another member state and refrain from hindering the exercise thereof by any measure whatever.\u201d\n40. In Recommendation 1410 (1999) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin, the Assembly noted that \u201cseveral tens of millions\u201d of Europeans were living outside their countries of origin. It continued:\n\u201c3. The Assembly believes that it is in the interest of states to ensure that their nationals continue actively to exercise their nationality, so that it does not become merely passive or essentially a matter of feelings and emotions, and that those nationals can in fact play an important go-between role in host countries, working for better political, cultural, economic and social relations between their country of origin and the country where they live.\u201d\n41. It recommended that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201ciii. prepare a recommendation to the member states with the intention of fostering voluntary participation of expatriates in political, social and cultural life in their country of origin, by instituting and harmonising arrangements for specific representation, such as the unrestricted right to vote or specific parliamentary and institutional representation through various consultative councils ...\n...\nv. invite member states:\n...\nc. to draw up, at national level, an in-depth, systematic analytical description of the respective situations of expatriates, with a view to co-ordinating expatriate relations policies at European level and harmonising arrangements for the institutional and political representation of expatriates, for example by creating a real expatriate status through appropriate legal instruments;\nd. to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interests in policy-making and in national practices concerning:\n...\niii. the right to vote in loco in the country of origin;\niv. the right to vote of expatriates in embassies and consulates in their host countries;\n...\u201d\n42. In Recommendation 1650 (2004) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin, the Assembly noted that the question of links between countries of origins and their expatriates was a relatively new problem, particularly in central and eastern Europe, that relations varied from strong and institutionalised to loose and informal and that there was no harmonisation in this respect at the pan-European level. It continued:\n\u201c4. The Parliamentary Assembly believes that it is in the interest of states to ensure that their expatriate nationals continue to actively exercise their rights linked to nationality and contribute in a variety of ways to the political, economic, social and cultural development of their countries of origin.\u201d\n43. The recommendation further noted that expatriation was the outcome of increasing globalisation and should be viewed as a positive expression of modernity and dynamism, bringing real economic benefit for both host countries and the countries of origin. The Assembly regretted the lack of follow-up to Recommendation 1410 (1999) and recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite member states, inter alia:\n\u201cc. to take account of their expatriates\u2019 interest in policy making, in particular concerning questions of nationality; political rights, including voting rights; economic rights, including taxation and pension rights; social rights, including social schemes; and cultural rights ...\u201d\n44. It further recommended that the Committee of Ministers:\n\u201cii. promote an exchange of views and co-operation between Council of Europe member states as regards political, legal, economic, social and cultural measures aimed at strengthening the links between European expatriates and their countries of origin;\niii. review the existing models of relations between expatriates and their countries of origin, with a view to making proposals for the introduction of legally-binding measures at the European level ...\u201d\n45. In Resolution 1459 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote, the Assembly stressed at the outset the importance of the right to vote and to stand in elections as a basic precondition for preserving other fundamental civil and political rights upheld by the Council of Europe. It noted that electoral rights were the basis of democratic legitimacy and representativeness of the political process and considered that they should, therefore, evolve to follow the progress of modern societies towards ever inclusive democracy. It stated:\n\u201c3. The Assembly considers that, as a rule, priority should be given to granting effective, free and equal electoral rights to the highest possible number of citizens, without regard to their ethnic origin, health, status as members of the military or criminal record. Due regard should be given to the voting rights of citizens living abroad.\u201d\n46. The resolution continued:\n\u201c7. Given the importance of the right to vote in a democratic society, the member countries of the Council of Europe should enable their citizens living abroad to vote during national elections bearing in mind the complexity of different electoral systems. They should take appropriate measures to facilitate the exercise of such voting rights as much as possible ... Member states should co-operate with one another for this purpose and refrain from placing unnecessary obstacles in the path of the effective exercise of the voting rights of foreign nationals residing on their territories.\u201d\n47. In conclusion, the Assembly invited the member and observer States concerned to:\n\u201cb. grant electoral rights to all their citizens (nationals), without imposing residency requirements;\nc. facilitate the exercise of expatriates\u2019 electoral rights by providing for absentee voting procedures ...\u201d\n48. In its follow-up Recommendation 1714 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote, the Assembly called upon the Committee of Ministers to appeal to member and observer States to, inter alia, review existing instruments with a view to assessing the possible need for a Council of Europe convention to improve international co-operation with a view to facilitating the exercise of electoral rights by expatriates.\n49. In Resolution 1591 (2007) on distance voting (i.e. the exercise of the right to vote when absent from the country) the Assembly reiterated that the right to vote was an essential freedom in every democratic system and invited member States to introduce distance voting.\n50. In 2008, the Assembly adopted two resolutions and two corresponding recommendations on the state of democracy in Europe, one on specific challenges facing European democracies (Resolution 1617 (2008) and Recommendation 1839 (2008)); and the other on measures to improve the democratic participation of migrants (Resolution 1618 (2008) and Recommendation 1840 (2008)). In these, the Assembly recalled that the essence of democracy was that all those concerned by a decision must be directly or indirectly part of the decision-making process. Accordingly, it considered representativeness to be of crucial importance and found it unacceptable that large groups of the population were excluded from the democratic process. It further observed that there were over sixty-four million migrants in Europe and that their increasing number resulted in a corresponding increasing need to ensure that they were given a \u201cfair share\u201d in the democratic process. While the Assembly focussed on the importance of the participation of migrants in the political process of the host country, it noted that democratic participation for migrants in their countries of origin was also important.\n51. In Resolution 1696 (2009) on engaging European diasporas, the Assembly noted that policies to manage the many challenges and opportunities that had emerged with migration had not kept pace with the development of the phenomenon. It recalled that it had been engaged in dealing with the issue of Europeans living abroad and their links to their homelands for the last fifteen years. It continued:\n\u201c4. The Assembly considers it essential to strike and maintain a proper balance between the process of integration in the host societies and the links with the country of origin. It is convinced that seeing migrants as political actors and not only as workers or economic actors enhances the recognition of their capacity in the promotion and transference of democratic values. The right to vote and be elected in host countries and the opportunity to take part in democratically governed European non-governmental organisations can enable diasporas to endorse an accountable and democratic system of governance in their home countries. Policies that grant migrants rights and obligations arising from their status as citizens or residents in both countries should therefore be encouraged.\n5. The Assembly regrets that, notwithstanding its long-standing calls to revise the existing models of relations between expatriates and their countries of origin, relations between member states of the Council of Europe and their diasporas are far from being harmonised. Many member states from central and eastern Europe are only beginning to recognise the potential development and other benefits of engaging their diasporas in a more institutionalised manner, especially in the context of the current global economic crisis.\n6. The Assembly reiterates that it is in the interest of member states to ensure that their diasporas continue to actively exercise the rights linked to their nationality and contribute in a variety of ways to the political, economic, social and cultural development of their countries of origin. It is convinced that globalisation and growing migration may have an impact on host countries in many positive ways by contributing to building diverse, tolerant and multicultural societies.\u201d\n52. It encouraged member States, as countries of origin, to adopt a number of policy initiatives, including civil and political incentives to:\n\u201c9.1.1. develop institutions and elaborate policies for maximum harmonisation of the political, economic, social and cultural rights of diasporas with those of the native population;\n9.1.2. ease the acquisition or maintenance of voting rights by offering out-of-country voting at national elections;\n...\u201d\n53. The corresponding Recommendation (1890 (2009)) recalled previous recommendations on the subject and instructed the European Committee on Migration to:\n\u201c5.2.1. define the status, rights and obligations of diasporas in Europe, both in their countries of origin and in host countries;\n...\n5.2.3. carry out a study on the experience of member states in setting up government offices for diasporas and the experience of granting voting rights to diasporas and access to other political participation mechanisms;\n...\u201d\n54. Finally, in its Resolution 1897 (2012) on ensuring greater democracy in elections the Assembly called on the member States to foster citizen participation in the electoral process, in particular by, inter alia:\n\u201c8.1.12. enabling all citizens to exercise their right to vote through proxy voting, postal voting or e-voting, on the condition that the secrecy and the security of the vote are guaranteed; facilitating the participation in the electoral process of citizens living abroad, subject to restrictions in accordance with the law, such as duration of residence abroad, whilst ensuring that, if polling stations are set up abroad, their establishment is based on transparent criteria; safeguarding the right to vote of vulnerable groups (people with disabilities, people who are illiterate, etc.) by adapting polling stations and voting material to their needs; abolishing legal provisions providing for general, automatic and indiscriminate disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners irrespective of the nature or gravity of their offences;\u201d\n55. In a number of the above texts, the Assembly also addressed the question of the political participation of migrants in their host countries (see also Recommendation 1500 (2001) on participation of immigrants and foreign residents in political life in the member States).\n#### B. The Committee of Ministers\n56. In its reply to Recommendation 1650 (2004) on links between Europeans living abroad and their countries of origin (see paragraphs 42-44 above), the Committee of Ministers commented that the Recommendation raised important and timely issues that should be given serious consideration and therefore brought it to the attention of the governments of the member States. The Committee of Ministers agreed with the Assembly that growing expatriation could be a positive effect of globalisation that contributed to building diverse, tolerant and multicultural societies and recognised the role that migrants could play as vectors of development for both countries of origin and destination. It further agreed that the right balance between the integration into host societies and the links with the country of origin should be achieved and maintained, and charged the European Committee on Migration with examining the concrete mechanisms linked to the migratory processes at the pan-European level, with a view to identifying the legal measures that could contribute to such a balance.\n57. In its reply to Recommendation 1714 (2005) on abolition of restrictions on the right to vote (see paragraph 47 above), the Committee of Ministers agreed that the abolition of existing restrictions on the right to vote should be the subject of further activities of the Council of Europe. It also agreed that that member States should take measures to facilitate the exercise of voting rights of citizens living abroad, for example through postal, consular or e-voting. However, it did not see any pressing need to elaborate a convention to improve international co-operation on the issue.\n58. In its Final Declaration at the 8th Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for migration affairs regarding \u201cEconomic migration, social cohesion and development: towards an integrated approach\u201d, 4\u20115 September 2008, the Committee of Ministers recognised that the Council of Europe had the potential to develop holistic and coherent policies in the field of migration based on human rights. The thematic report prepared as a main reference for the Conference contained a chapter on migration and social cohesion. On the question of links between the migrant and the country of origin, the report noted:\n\u201c286. At the same time, long term and permanent immigrants increasingly maintain multiple social, economic and political ties and sometimes, dual citizenship with both host and home countries, establishing social and communities that transcend geographical, cultural and political borders. As well, migrants are developing transnational activities and multicultural and multilingual skills. These evolving features of international migration also need to be taken into account in designing policies and practices to ensure social inclusion and cohesion in European countries.\u201d\n59. The report also commented on the emergence of \u201ctransnationalism\u201d in the area of migration:\n\u201c386. ... The term transnationalism refers to processes whereby migrants develop multiple social ties between the society from which they come and the host society, establishing social communities that transcend geographical, cultural and political borders. More people attain multiple identities, transnational relationships and dual or multiple citizenship. An increasing number of migrants are organising their lives with reference to two or more societies and are developing transnational activities and multicultural and multilingual skills. Dual citizenship and European \u2018citizenship\u2019 reflect greater freedom of movement, multicultural societies, employment mobility, activities in two or more countries, and so on. An increasing migratory circulation within the European area reflecting a gradual emergence of cosmopolitan, intercultural and global citizenship.\u201d\n#### C. The Venice Commission\n60. The European Commission for Democracy though Law (\u201cVenice Commission\u201d) adopted Guidelines on Elections at its 51st Plenary Session on 5-6 July 2002. As regards the principle of universal suffrage, the Guidelines provided:\n\u201cUniversal suffrage means in principle that all human beings have the right to vote and to stand for election. This right may, however, and indeed should, be subject to certain conditions ...\u201d\n61. These conditions included conditions of age, nationality, residence and other grounds for deprivation of the right to vote. As to residence, the Guidelines noted:\n\u201ci. A residence requirement may be imposed.\nii. Residence in this case means habitual residence.\niii. A length of residence requirement may be imposed on nationals solely for local or regional elections.\niv. The requisite period of residence should not exceed six months; a longer period may be required only to protect national minorities.\nv. The right to vote and to be elected may be accorded to citizens residing abroad.\u201d\n62. The Guidelines were subsequently included, together with an explanatory report, in the Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters adopted by the Venice Commission at its 52nd Plenary Session, 18\u201119 October 2002.\n63. At its 61st Plenary Session, 3-4 December 2004, the Venice Commission endorsed two reports on the Abolition of Restrictions on the Right to Vote in General Elections (CDL-AD (2005) 012 and CDL-AD (2005) 011). One of the reports contained reflections on the right to vote of expatriates in their countries of origin. It noted:\n\u201c28. Most of the citizens in European countries who are temporarily working or staying abroad are registered in the Voters\u2019 List in their country of origin. Those persons are mainly registered according to their last place of residence prior to the departure abroad. This clearly indicates the determination of the legislators to use residence as a basis for allocation of the citizens (who have a right to vote) in the Voters\u2019 List ...\u201d\n64. It continued:\n\u201c31. One question arises from the aforesaid facts: why do most of the states decide to adopt the concept that links the right of a citizen to vote with his or her residence? The methodology of voter registration determines the distribution of the polling stations, and accordingly results in the layout of the electoral districts. But, citizens who are abroad on Election Day in the same Council of Europe member states may exercise their right to vote in the diplomatic and consular offices or by mail. However, according to the legislation of the same countries, they would have to return to their country and cast their vote in the polling station located in the municipality where their last residence was before they left the country. Not all of them might be in a position to do so.\n32. In our view, the country of origin should find a formula to encompass this category of voters who reside abroad and want to exercise their right to vote, but cannot come to their country on Election Day. It is up to the citizen to decide whether or not he/she wishes to exercise this right. The same approach should be applied to the legal requirement for passive suffrage ... This approach is particularly important for countries with a large numbers of its nationals living abroad, who, at the same time, maintain relations with [the] state ...\u201d\n65. A subsequent opinion on the Assembly\u2019s Recommendation 1714 (2005) (see paragraph 47 above) adopted by the Venice Commission in October 2005 noted:\n\u201c3. The right to vote as one of the fundamental political rights is also fundamental for the fulfilment of a number of civil and social rights. At the same time the principles of universality, equality, freedom and secret ballots are the four pillars of the European electoral heritage and they are introduced into the constitutions and electoral legislation of the member and observer states of the Council of Europe. In this respect the abolition of existing restrictions on the right to vote should be of interest to states and it should also serve as an issue for further activities of the Council of Europe and other international organisations.\n4. In some member and observer states of the Council of Europe, the implementation of existing standards and general principles is deeply influenced by customs, and traditions, but most of all by the level of political culture. In a number of cases and situations in countries of Europe and elsewhere various norms and practices have been established which restrict the right to vote to certain categories of people. Such restrictions are problematic from a human rights perspective. European institutions and in this case the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe are working to overcome such restrictions.\u201d\n66. The opinion concluded that the Venice Commission was following the achievements in the area of democratic elections and in respect of voting rights as one of the basic human rights which would continue to influence improvements in international and national legislation.\n67. A report on Electoral Law and Electoral Administration in Europe, adopted by the Venice Commission in June 2006 (CDL-AD (2006) 018), noted, on the question of overseas voters:\n\u201c57. External voting rights, e.g. granting nationals living abroad the right to vote, are a relatively new phenomenon. Even in long-established democracies, citizens living in foreign countries were not given voting rights until the 1980s (e.g. Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom) or the 1990s (e.g., Canada, Japan). In the meantime, however, many emerging or new democracies in Europe have introduced legal provisions for external voting (out-of-country voting, overseas voting). Although it is yet not common in Europe, the introduction of external voting rights might be considered, if not yet present. However, safeguards must be implemented to ensure the integrity of the vote .....\u201d\n68. In June 2011 the Venice Commission adopted a report on Out\u2011of\u2011Country Voting (CDL-AD (2011) 022). The report noted the complexity of the issue of the right to vote of overseas electors and indicated that it was within the scope of the State\u2019s own sovereignty to decide whether to grant the right to vote to citizens residing abroad. The report identified the following arguments in favour of out-of-country voting:\n\u201c63. Legal recognition of citizens is based on the principle of \u2018nationality\u2019. The citizens of a country therefore enjoy, in principle, all the civil rights recognised in that country.\n64. The principle of \u2018out-of-country voting\u2019 enables citizens living outside their country of origin to continue participating in the political life of their country on a \u2018remote\u2019 basis ...\n65. Out-of-country voting guarantees equality between citizens living in the country and expatriates.\n66. It ensures that citizens maintain ties with the", "001-87512": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF GINNIFER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 65507/01)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n17 July 2008\nFINAL\n17/10/2008\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Ginnifer v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nLech Garlicki, President,\nNicolas Bratza,\nGiovanni Bonello,\nLjiljana Mijovi\u0107,\nJ\u00e1n \u0160ikuta,\nP\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4,\nLedi Bianku, judges,\nand Lawrence Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 June 2008,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n11. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007; and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, 25 July 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n12. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt, WMA, WBA and WP constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n13. By a letter of 12 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr Ginnifer had been offered GBP 6,589.52 in respect of his claims for Wpt and/or WMA including costs and that he had accepted the offer.\n14. The Court takes note of the friendly settlement reached between the parties in respect of Wpt and/or WMA. It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n15. Consequently, this part of the application should be struck out of the list.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Government contested the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s claims on the basis that he had only made an oral claim in respect of WBA and therefore failed to comply with a domestic requirement. According to the relevant domestic provisions telephone claims could be accepted from 1998 onwards, but only if they related to the current year of assessment, namely, the year of assessment in which the claim was made, or the following year. In the present case Mr Ginnifer\u2019s claims for the tax years 1996/97 and 1997/98 referred to previous years\u2019 assessment. Consequently, the applicant cannot claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.\n17. The applicant submitted that the Court should not differ from its holding in White v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.53134/99) in which it rejected the Government\u2019s plea regarding benefit claims not made in the proper format. Indeed, there were no reasons why claims for WBA could not be treated on a par with claims for other bereavement benefits.\n18. The Court recalls that the precise form in which an applicant indicates his intention to claim benefits is not of importance, the central question being whether the applicant has made clear his wish to claim benefits (see White, cited above). The Court finds that in the present case the applicant made clear such intention and he can accordingly claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention for the purposes of Article 34.\n19. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n20. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (H", "001-90234": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF KHURSHID MUSTAFA AND TARZIBACHI v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. The Land Code\n15. The renting of a flat is regulated primarily in Chapter 12 of the Land Code.\n16. Section 2 provides that a tenancy agreement shall be in writing if the landlord or the tenant so request. In the event that a provision in the agreement is difficult to interpret, it is in practice ultimately interpreted to the disadvantage of the person who formulated the agreement. As it is almost always the landlord who draws up the tenancy agreement, the landlord has to take the responsibility for an agreement that is difficult to interpret. In most cases, landlords use standard agreements, the content of which is the result of negotiations between rental market organisations.\n17. Section 3 contains provisions for the term and cancellation of tenancies. A tenancy agreement which is applicable for an indefinite period, as in the present case, must be cancelled for it to cease to apply. According to section 4, an indefinite tenancy agreement can be cancelled and thus cease to apply on the first day of the month following three months' notice. Section 8 provides that, in a case such as the present, a notice of cancellation shall be in writing and comply with certain rules governing service.\n18. Section 23 provides, inter alia, that a tenant may not use the flat for a purpose other than that intended. Under section 24, the tenant is under an obligation to take good care of the flat. In general, he or she shall take care of it in a way that can be reasonably expected of an orderly person. Further, the tenant is liable to make good all damage caused by his or her carelessness or negligence.\n19. Section 25 contains provisions on disturbances and demands on the tenant for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. Subsection 1 provides:\n\u201cWhen using the flat, the tenant shall ensure that persons living in the vicinity are not subjected to disturbances which may be harmful to their health or otherwise impair their dwelling environment to an extent not reasonably tolerable ... . In his use of the flat, the tenant shall also in other respects do all that is necessary to keep the property sound, orderly and in good condition. ...\u201d\nDisturbances and failure to meet those requirements may result in the tenancy agreement being forfeited under section 42.\nSpecial provisions and regulations can be included in the tenancy agreement. A tenant's refusal to abide by such provisions and regulations may also constitute a failure to fulfil the requirements for keeping the flat sound, orderly and in good condition.\n20. It follows from section 46 that if the landlord has given notice of cancellation of the tenancy agreement, the tenant may still be entitled to have the agreement extended. However, subsection 1 of section 46 lists a number of situations in which the tenant loses the right to renewal. The first situation, laid down in subsection 1(1), is the forfeiture of the tenancy. Section 42 stipulates the conditions in which a tenancy agreement is deemed to be forfeited, including residential disturbances and failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition. The second situation, regulated in subsection 1(2), was relied on by the landlord and applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. It concerns the tenant's neglect of their obligations. If the obligations are neglected to such an extent that it is not reasonable for the tenancy agreement to be extended, the tenant may lose the right to such renewal.\nThe preparatory works to the latter provision state that the requirements of orderliness must be high in order to make it possible for the landlord to maintain the property in good order and condition (SOU 1961:47, pp. 84-85). The interests of the landlord shall be weighed against the reasonableness of the tenancy being terminated. Distressing personal circumstances may be taken into account. The possibility of another flat in the same area should also be considered (Government Bill 1968:91, Appendix A, p. 91).\nExamples of negligence are, for example, failure to pay rent, subletting without permission, refusing to grant the landlord access to the flat, depositing rent without valid reasons, residential disturbances, a failure to keep the flat sound, orderly and in good condition, and a breach of clauses in the tenancy agreement.\n#### B. Proceedings in tenancy disputes\n21. A large number of tenancy disputes are examined by the eight regional rent review boards, whose task it is, under section 4 of the Lease Review Boards and Rent Review Boards Act (Lagen om arrenden\u00e4mnder och hyresn\u00e4mnder, 1973:1988), to examine disputes concerning, for example, the terms of a tenancy and disputes relating to the renewal of a tenancy agreement. A decision by a Rent Review Board in a renewal dispute, as in the present case, can be appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal, in accordance with the Land Code, Chapter 12, section 70 in conjunction with section 49. No appeal lies against the court's decision, as provided for in section 10 of the Svea Court of Appeal Rent Cases Judicial Procedure Act (Lagen om r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngen i vissa hyresm\u00e5l i Svea hovr\u00e4tt, 1994:831).\n#### C. Constitutional provisions on freedom of expression and freedom of information\n22. Chapter 1, section 3, subsection 3 of the Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression (Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen) states the following:\n\u201cSubject to any contrary provision of this Constitutional Law neither public authorities nor other public bodies shall prohibit or prevent the possession or employment of such technical aids as are necessary to receive radio programmes or to view or hear the content of technical recordings on grounds of the content of a radio programme or technical recording,.The same shall apply to any ban on the construction of landline networks for the transmission of radio programmes.\u201d\n23. Chapter 2, section 1, subsection 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides, inter alia, as follows:\n\u201cEvery citizen shall be guaranteed the following rights and freedoms in his relations with the public institutions:\n1. freedom of expression: that is, the freedom to communicate information and express thoughts, opinions and sentiments, whether orally, pictorially, in writing, or in any other way;\n2. freedom of information: that is, the freedom to procure and receive information and otherwise acquaint oneself with the utterances of others;\n...\u201d\nSection 12 provides that the enumerated rights and freedoms may be restricted only to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society. The restriction may never go beyond what is necessary having regard to the purpose which occasioned it, nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free formation of opinion as one of the fundaments of democracy. Furthermore, no restriction may be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious, cultural or other such opinion. Under section 13, freedom of expression and information can only be restricted on grounds of national security, national provision of supplies, public order and safety, the good name of an individual, the sanctity of private life, and the prevention and prosecution of crime. Freedom of expression may also be restricted in commercial activities.\n24. The Constitutional Law on Freedom of Expression and the Instrument of Government apply to the relationship between individuals and public bodies. They do not apply to relationships between individuals.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n25. The applicants complained that their freedom to receive information had been breached because the restrictions imposed on them either had not been prescribed by law or had been more far-reaching than necessary in a democratic society. Moreover, they claimed that the consequences \u2013 the eviction from their flat and the move to another town \u2013 had been disproportionate to the aims pursued. They relied on Article 10 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n#### A. The parties' submissions\n26. The Government submitted that the complaint was incompatible ratione materiae or manifestly ill-founded. They argued that the dispute in the case had been limited to the question of the actual positioning of the satellite dish, having regard, primarily, to contractual obligations. The alleged interference had not arisen as an effect of a ruling by a public authority on the right to receive information or even the right to use or own a satellite dish. Instead, it had come about only as an effect of the Court of Appeal's interpretation and application of an obligation in a contract between two private parties within the framework of private litigation. In any event, the Swedish authorities would only be responsible to the extent that the State had a positive obligation to protect the rights of the applicants in a case of this nature. In this connection the Government were of the opinion that the Court of Appeal had struck a fair balance between the competing interests of the landlord and the applicants and that there did not exist a positive obligation to protect the applicants' right to receive information from the interference of others. There had therefore not been an interference by a public authority within the meaning of Article 10 of the Convention.\n27. The Government argued that were the Court to find that Article 10 was applicable and had been infringed, the interference in question was prescribed by law, specifically Chapter 12 of the Land Code, and that it served the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others, including those of the landlord, other tenants and third parties. As to the question whether the measure had been \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10, they claimed that a fair balance had been struck between the landlord's right to property and its interest in maintaining order and good conditions on the property, on the one hand, and the applicants' right to receive information by means of a private satellite dish, on the other. Moreover, the proceedings had been fair at every level, the two instances involved having given extensive and detailed reasons after holding hearings and inspecting the satellite installation in question. Thus, having regard also to the margin of appreciation, the alleged interference had been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and \u201cnecessary\u201d in terms of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n28. The applicants submitted that the grounds for contesting the landlord's action had not been only their denial that the positioning of the satellite was in breach of the lease, but also that that action infringed their right to freedom of information under the Swedish Constitution and Article 10 of the Convention. They further claimed that the Court of Appeal had not balanced the various interests in any real or meaningful sense. It had not attached proper significance to the applicants' right to freedom of information and had failed to take into account that there had been no safety risks in the individual case, instead allowing the landlord to make general risk assessments. The applicants therefore claimed that there had been an interference with their rights under Article 10. This had occurred as a consequence of the Court of Appeal's application of the law and, accordingly, the State's exercise of judicial power in a civil-law dispute. Consequently, the State could not evade its responsibility in the matter.\n29. The applicants further asserted that the Court of Appeal's decision lacked a basis in law, as their satellite installation, which had not been affixed to the structure of the building, had not violated Rule 13 of the tenancy agreement and so had not breached the Land Code. Furthermore, the interference in the case had not been \u201cnecessary\u201d, as a fair balance between the competing interests had not been struck. In this connection they reiterated that their rights under Article 10 had been disregarded and that no individual safety assessment had been made. Moreover, broadcasts from certain TV channels \u2013 of particular importance to them on account of their cultural background \u2013 were available exclusively via a satellite dish. This had not been disputed in the domestic proceedings. Finally, there had been no margin of appreciation, as no vital State interests had been at issue. Instead, the reasons given by the Court of Appeal related to the landlord's interests. In sum, the interference had not been proportionate or \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of Article 10 \u00a7 2.\n#### B. The Court's assessment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n30. The Government argued that the case concerned a dispute between two private parties over a contractual obligation and that there had not been intervention by a public authority such as to bring any positive obligation of the State into play.\n31. The Court reiterates that, under Article 1 of the Convention, each Contracting State \u201cshall secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention\u201d. As the Court stated in Marckx v. Belgium (13 June 1979, \u00a7 31, Series A no. 31; see also Young, James and Webster v. the United Kingdom, 13 August 1981, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 44), in addition to the primarily negative undertaking of a State to abstain from interference in Convention guarantees, \u201cthere may be positive obligations inherent\u201d in such guarantees. The responsibility of a State may then be engaged as a result of not observing its obligation to enact domestic legislation.\n32. The Court reiterates, further, that Article 10 applies to judicial decisions preventing a person from receiving transmissions from telecommunications satellites (see Autronic AG v. Switzerland, 22 May 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 47-48, Series A no. 178).

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n26. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n27. The Government contested that argument and maintained that the proceedings began on 2 July 1996, when the police had carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises.\n28. The applicant was of the view that the proceedings had begun on 6 May 1994, but agreed with the Government that he had certainly been substantially affected as from 2 July 1996. The applicant also pointed out that the High Court had mistakenly found that the proceedings had begun only on 12 February 1998, which was part of the applicant\u2019s argument for bringing the case before the Supreme Court.\n29. The Court considers that the applicant was not substantially affected by the proceedings until 2 July 1996, when the police carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s premises. The proceedings ended on 21 June 2006, when the Leave to Appeal Board refused the applicant\u2019s request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court\u2019s judgment. Thus, the criminal proceedings lasted almost ten years.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of the proceedings\n30. From a general point of view the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings must be assessed with reference to the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the authorities before which the case was brought (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n##### 1. Complexity of the case\n31. The Government submitted that the criminal proceedings were extraordinarily complex as concerns the facts, law and procedural issues.\n32. The applicant disputed that the case was highly complex and emphasised, among other things, that in his case very few foreign company structures were used and almost all the banks were based in Denmark, thus a very limited part of the investigation had to be carried out abroad.\n33. The Court reiterates that the scale and complexity of a criminal case concerning fraud, which is often compounded further by the involvement of several suspects, may justify the extensive length of proceedings (see, among other authorities, C.P. and Others v. France, no. 36009/97, \u00a7 30, 1 August 2000; Hozee v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-III, p. 1102, \u00a7 52; Wejrup v. Denmark (dec.), no. 49126/99, ECHR 2002-IV, Petersen v. Denmark (dec.), no. 6315/02, 13 May 2004; and Frederiksen v. Denmark (dec.), 23012/02, 16 September 2004).\n34. In the present case the applicant and five co-accused were convicted of tax asset stripping of numerous private limited companies and corporate groups. The applicant and the co-accused were intricately interconnected and had collaborated in the economic crime.\n35. The applicant was found guilty on forty-four counts out of a total of fifty-nine and his responsibility related to an amount of approximately EUR 11,600,000 of the total amount of tax evaded in the case, which came to approximately EUR 19,000,000.\n36. The court records before the City Court and the High Court ran to 1,330 pages and 861 pages respectively, and the City Court judgment ran to 220 pages.\n37. The Court points out that the City Court, in its judgment of 6 April 2001, noted that the complexity of the acts carried out by the applicant and the five co-accused partly when buying and \u201cstripping\u201d the companies of assets, partly when writing off projects abroad, necessitated an investigation of an extraordinary scope. It found no reason to criticise the prosecution\u2019s decision to join the criminal proceedings against the applicant and the five co\u2011accused and it emphasised that due to the nature and scope of the charges, the cases against applicant and the co-accused B and R could not proceed before the cases against H, N and A had been heard.\n38. Furthermore, the Court observes that the investigation was carried out in Denmark and abroad and necessitated the issuing of numerous search warrants and discovery orders.\n39. Having regard to these circumstances, the Court finds that the investigations and the court proceedings were relevant, time-consuming and difficult. Thus, for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention the case was particularly complex.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s conduct\n40. In the Government\u2019s opinion the applicant\u2019s conduct contributed to some extent to the length of the proceedings, firstly because the crimes that he had committed rendered it necessary to carry out comprehensive and time-consuming investigations in Denmark and abroad, in addition to thorough reviews of large quantities of accounting material, secondly because the applicant\u2019s counsel was unable to appear before the High Court in the autumn of 2002, and thirdly because one of the co-defendants fell ill in the spring of 2004.\n41. The applicant disagreed and contended that his conduct had not given rise to any significant delay.\n42. It is true that the use by the applicant and the co-accused in the present case of intricate corporate structures, several of which were domiciled in or connected with foreign countries, obviously had the purpose of concealing the tax asset stripping, but this has already been taken into account in the assessment of the complexity of the case. Moreover, the Court finds that the applicant, during the criminal", "001-57874": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF STANFORD v.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 October 1993 and 25 January 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. In England and Wales, the right of an accused to be present in court at his trial is a matter of common law. The general rule was stated by Lord Reading CJ in R. v. Lee Kun (1916) 1 Kings Bench Reports 337, at 341, as follows:\n\u201cThere must be very exceptional circumstances to justify proceeding with the trial in the absence of the accused. The reason why the accused should be present at the trial is that he may hear the case made against him and have the opportunity ... of answering it. The presence of the accused means not only that he must be physically in attendance, but also that he must be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings.\u201c\n18. A trial judge may, if he considers that the accused in the dock may intimidate a witness, remove the accused from the presence of the witness, though not out of hearing (R. v. Smellie (1919) 14 Criminal Appeal Reports 128).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n19. The applicant lodged his application (no. 16757/90) with the Commission on 8 January 1990. He complained under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention that as he could not hear the proceedings which resulted in his conviction he did not receive a fair trial.\n20. On 10 February 1992 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint admissible. In its report of 21 October 1992 drawn up under Article 31 (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (eleven votes to seven). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report are reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nAS TO THE LAW\n21. The applicant complained that he did not receive a fair trial since he was unable to hear the proceedings. He relied on Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\n22. The applicant stated that as a result of not being able to hear the proceedings he was not a fully informed party to counsel\u2019s decisions on the conduct of his case and was deprived of the opportunity of checking for himself which matters of evidence were consistent or inconsistent with the written statements against him. By complaining to the prison officer who was guarding him in the dock, as well as to his lawyers, he had done all that could have been expected of him to notify the court. He maintained that he did not agree with the decision of his lawyers not to make a representation to the trial judge.\nHe further submitted that the responsibility of the respondent Government was engaged since it was the poor acoustics of the courtroom which were the primary cause of his difficulties in hearing the proceedings. This was borne out by the decision to instal a reflector panel above the dock to increase audibility (see paragraph 16 above).\n23. The Government, on the other hand, pointed out that the acoustics of the courtroom were tested both before the court was opened and in 1990, subsequent to the applicant\u2019s complaint. On both occasions they were found to be satisfactory.\nIn their view, as well as that of the Commission, the responsibility of the Government was not otherwise engaged since neither the applicant nor his lawyers complained or made any representation to the court about the applicant\u2019s hearing difficulties. Moreover, this was a deliberate and tactical decision by counsel with which the applicant could be taken to have agreed. Nothing therefore occurred during the course of the trial which would have put the judge on notice of this problem.\n24.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n7. The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41, 25 July 2007.\n8. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (\u201cthe 1999 Act\u201d) introduced various new social-security payments, inter alia, Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance.\n9. Bereavement Payment is payable both to men and women in place of Widow\u2019s Payment. The same conditions applied, except that the new payment was available to both widows and widowers whose spouse died on or after 9 April 2001. However, the amount is double the sum offered under the previous scheme. Bereavement Allowance replaced Widow\u2019s Pension. It is an allowance for widows and widowers over the age of 45 but under pensionable age at the time of the spouse\u2019s death and where there are no dependent children. It is payable for 52 weeks from the date of bereavement.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n10. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d), constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\n11. He further complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefits to which he would have been entitled had his wife died after April 2001, namely Bereavement Payment (\u201cBP\u201d) and Bereavement Allowance (\u201cBA\u201d) constituted discrimination against him contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n2. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 provides (as relevant):\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n12. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n13. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n14. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to Wpt, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n15. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n16. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to Wpt, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Pension\n##### 1. Admissibility\n17. The Court held in its lead judgment regarding WP that at its origin, and until its abolition in respect of women whose spouses died after 9 April 2001, WP was intended to correct \u201cfactual inequalities\u201d between older widows, as a group, and the rest of the population and that this difference in treatment was reasonably and objectively justified. Moreover, the Court considered that the United Kingdom could not be criticised for not having abolished WP earlier and that it was not unreasonable of the legislature to decide to introduce the reform slowly (see Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 40-41). The Court, consequently, considering that it was not necessary to examine the complaint separately under Article 8, did not find a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the non-payment to the applicants of Widow\u2019s Pension or equivalent (ibid \u00a7 42).\n18. Consequently, the complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### C. Bereavement Payment and Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n19.

De Gaetano, judges,\nand Fato\u015f Arac\u0131, Deputy Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 14 June 2011,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n27. At the material time, following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, an applicant had a right of appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (\u201cthe AIT\u201d). Section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as inserted by section 81(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004) provided that a party to an appeal to the AIT could apply for an order that the AIT reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law.\n28. Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted, an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) stated that:\n\u201cWhen a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n(i) had not already been considered; and\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.\u201d\n29. Where a person was not granted leave to enter the United Kingdom, he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971. Pursuant to section 3(5) of the 1971 Act, the Secretary of State also had power to deport any person who was not a British citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d.\n### III. RELEVANT EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n30. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted (\u201cthe Qualification Directive\u201d) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian\u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.\n31. On 17 October 2007 the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d) asking, inter alia, whether article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.\n32. The ECJ held that article 15(c) protection went beyond that of Article 3 of the Convention, which was covered by article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive. The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows:\n\u201cArticle 15(c) of the Directive, in conjunction with article 2(e) of the Directive, must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances, and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian, returned to the relevant country or as the case may be, to the relevant region, would, solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject to that threat.\u201d\n33. In QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 620 the Court of Appeal observed that the ECJ in Elgafaji had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality, but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article 15(c). A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article 15(c) where the level of violence was such that, without anything to render them a particular target, civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety.\n34. More recently, in the case of HM and Others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2010] UKUT 331, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat, whether permissible under the laws or not, that seriously endangered non-combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive.\n### IV. RELEVANT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION\n35. It is a well-established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country. This principle is reflected both in article 8 of the Qualification Directive and paragraph 339O of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended), both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay.\n36. In the cases of Januzi, Hamid, Gaafar and Mohammed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] UKHL 5 and AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 49 the House of Lords held that the decision-maker, taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin, must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so. In this regard, the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality, including in his former place of habitual residence. If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation, judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally, and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty, it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there. However, the more closely the persecution was linked to the State, and the greater the control of the State over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf, the more likely (other things being equal) that a victim of persecution in one place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same State.\n### V. RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT SOMALIA\n#### A. Factual background\n37. The factual background to the conflict in Somalia, as described in the country reports at paragraphs 80 \u2013 188 below and subsequently agreed by the parties, is as follows.\n38. Somalia is comprised of three autonomous areas: the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the north west, the state of Puntland in the north east, and the remaining southern and central regions. Somali society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families, which are subdivided into clans and sub-clans. The four majority clans are Darod, Hawiye, Isaaq and Dir. In addition there are a number of minority groups, which are also divided into sub-groups. The Digli and Mirifle take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups.\n39. Somalia has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President Siad Barre by opposing clans in 1991. The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness, civil conflict and clan warfare followed. Mogadishu was fragmented into rival, clan-based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords. The Transitional Federal Government was established in October 2004 but a combination of internal divisions within the Transitional Federal Government and insecurity in central and southern Somalia hindered it from becoming a functioning Government. In June 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts, a union of various Sharia courts, took control of Mogadishu. Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism, the Union of Islamic Courts took control of most of central and southern Somalia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1725 (2006) authorised the deployment of an African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development force to protect the Transitional Federal Government. Ethiopian ground and air forces also moved into Somalia to support the Transitional Federal Government and by late December 2006 the Union of Islamic Courts had been ousted from Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia. Remnants of the Union of Islamic Courts withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian troops.\n40. After the fall of the Union of Islamic Courts, the semblance of order and security that it had created in Mogadishu deteriorated. Roadblocks and checkpoints returned, as did banditry and violence. Furthermore, attacks by anti-government elements on Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces continued in Mogadishu, with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting. Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced. The fall of the Union of Islamic Courts also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra-clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued.\n41. In 2007 the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia was created when Somali Islamists and opposition leaders joined forces to fight the Transitional Federal Government and Ethiopian forces.\n42. On 20 August 2008 the Transitional Federal Government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia signed a ceasefire agreement in Djibouti. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council extended the mandate of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. However, the Islamic insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement, and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until Ethiopian forces withdrew from Somalia.\n43. By late 2008 Islamist insurgents, including a group called al\u2011Shabaab, had regained control of most of southern Somalia.\n44. Somalia\u2019s Parliament met in Djibouti in January 2009 and swore in 149 new members from the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia. The Parliament also extended the mandate of the Transitional Federal Government for another two years and installed moderate Islamist Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmad as the new President.\n45. Ethiopia pulled its troops out of Somalia in January 2009. Soon after, al-Shabaab took control of Baidoa, formerly a key stronghold of the Transitional Federal Government. In May 2009 Islamist insurgents launched an attack on Mogadishu, prompting President Ahmad to appeal for help from abroad.\n46. In October 2009 al-Shabaab consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival, Hizbul Islam, out of the southern port city of Kismayo. Since then it has openly declared its alliance with al-Qaeda and has been steadily moving forces up towards Mogadishu.\n47. In December 2010 Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab merged.\n#### B. Parties to the conflict\n##### 1. The Transitional Federal Government\n48. The Transitional Federal Government is recognised by the United Nations and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of Somalia. However, it currently controls only a small section of Mogadishu centred on the port, the airport and the presidential palace. It is largely dependent on African Union troops for its survival.\n##### 2. African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)\n49. AMISOM is an African Union force authorised by the UN Security Council and deployed to Mogadishu to support the Transitional Federal Government. It currently consists of 5,300 Ugandan and Burundian troops.\n##### 3. Ethiopian forces\n50. Ethiopian forces joined the conflict in 2006 to help drive out the Union of Islamic Courts. They remained in Somalia until their withdrawal at the beginning of 2009.\n##### 4. Al-Shabaab\n51. Al-Shabaab began as part of the armed wing of the Union of Islamic Courts. When the 2006 Ethiopian military intervention sent the leaders of the Union of Islamic Courts into exile, a hard core of al-Shabaab fighters remained in Somalia to fight. In their April 2010 report, \u201cHarsh War, Harsh Peace\u201d, Human Rights Watch indicated that al-Shabaab was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity, but the group\u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda: defeating AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government and extending Sharia law across Somalia. Some of its leaders have links with al-Qaeda although the extent of al-Qaeda\u2019s influence over al-Shabaab remains unclear.\n52. Al-Shabaab has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground, especially in southern Somalia. They have received material support from the Eritrean government, which is eager to undercut Ethiopia\u2019s interests in the region. By the end of 2009 al-Shabaab controlled more territory than any other faction in Somalia, including Baidoa, the former seat of the Transitional Federal Government parliament, Jowhar, which had been one of the Transitional Federal Government President\u2019s most reliable strongholds, and the strategic port of Kismayo.\n53. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala on 11 July 2010, which killed 79 people watching the World Cup soccer final on television. It was al-Shabaab\u2019s first attack outside Somalia and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond.\n##### 5. Hizbul Islam\n54. Hizbul Islam is another armed group which has both a Sharia agenda and the goal of driving AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government from Mogadishu. In early 2009 it entered into an alliance with al-Shabaab but the alliance came to an end in October 2009 during the fight for Kismayo. In December 2010, however, it once again merged with al\u2011Shabaab.\n##### 6. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca\n55. Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca is an Islamist group which professes to support a more moderate agenda. The group exists primarily in central Somalia, where it has maintained control over large strips of territory, predominantly in Galgadud and Hiran regions.\n56. In February 2010 Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca signed a power-sharing and military unification pact with the Transitional Federal Government, although at times relations between the two groups were strained.\n### VI. RELEVANT CASE LAW\n#### A. NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076\n57. In NM and others (Lone women \u2013 Ashraf) Somalia CG [2005] UKAIT 00076 the AIT found that conditions in southern Somalia and particularly in and around Mogadishu were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of Article 3 ill-treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them. Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection, although individual circumstances required separate consideration. Although women were at greater risk than men, they would not be able to show that, simply as lone female returnees from the United Kingdom, they had no place of clan safety. Finally, the AIT held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in Somalia did not engage the obligations of the Refugee Convention or engage Article 3 of the Convention for all female returnees. A differential impact had to be shown. Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator.\n58. The AIT observed in passing that, on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing, it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an IDP camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under Article 3, if not under the Refugee Convention.\n#### B. HH and Others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022\n59. In HH and others (Mogadishu: armed conflict: risk) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00022 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal held that for the purposes of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive, a situation of internal armed conflict existed in Mogadishu. The AIT held, however, that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians, they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and, as a consequence, a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area.\n60. The AIT found that although clan support networks were strained, they had not yet collapsed. Majority clans continued to have arms, even though their militias no longer controlled the city. A person from a majority clan, or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with, or acceptance by, a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance, including at times of displacement. A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at real risk of serious harm of being targeted by criminal elements, both in any area of former residence and in the likely event of being displaced. Members of minority groups found it harder to flee and move around to escape fighting, because they were not so easily accepted in new surroundings. The AIT found that persons displaced from their home in Mogadishu without being able to find a place elsewhere with clan members or friends would likely have to spend a significant period of time in a makeshift shelter, such as those along the road to Afgooye, or in an IDP camp, and could well experience treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention.\n61. Finally, the AIT held that the issue of whether a person from a minority clan would be able to find majority clan support would often need specific and detailed consideration. The evidence suggested that certain minority groups could be accepted by the majority clan of the area in question, so as to call on protection from that clan. On the current evidence, it might not be appropriate to assume that a finding of minority group status in southern Somalia was in itself sufficient to entitle a person to international protection, particularly where a person\u2019s credibility was otherwise lacking.\n#### C. AM and AM (armed conflict: risk categories) Somalia CG [2008] UKAIT 00091\n62. In its most recent Somali Country Guidance determination, the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal found that since its decision in HH there had been a number of significant changes in Somalia.\n63. First, the AIT found that by mid-2008 the armed conflict had spread beyond Mogadishu and its environs. The AIT therefore found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout central and southern Somalia. In respect of the intensity of the violence, the AIT noted that \u201cmanifestly all significant armed parties to the conflict have engaged in indiscriminate attacks\u201d. In particular, it noted that the Ethiopians were reported to have used means of war (firing inherently indiscriminate Katyusha rockets in urban areas) and methods of warfare (using mortars and indirect weapons without guidance in urban areas) that violated International Humanitarian Law. The TGF were reported to have engaged in aggression against civilians and to have acted \u201cas if they believe that they are immune from accountability, investigation or prosecution, including for crimes under international law\u201d. Moreover, reports indicated that insurgents had perpetrated raids, robberies and other abuses against civilians, including rape and other forms of sexual violence. The AIT referred to information received from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (\u201cIASC\u201d) which expressed concerns about:\n\u201cindiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas; indiscriminate use of roadside bombs and mortars from and in civilian areas; indiscriminate shooting in response to roadside bombs; arbitrary arrest and detention of civilians, including children; forced evictions; forced recruitment, including of children; sexual and gender based violence; intimidation and assassination of journalists, aid workers and civilian officials; and extra-judicial killings.\u201d\n64. The AIT also noted that the worsening security situation was coupled with a deteriorating humanitarian situation. It observed that between 400,000 and 750,000 people had been displaced from Mogadishu and that there had been significant displacements from other towns to which armed clashes had spread. The AIT also observed first, that IDPs experienced serious problems while on the move, which included checkpoints, threats, intimidation, looting, rape, abduction and harassment; secondly, that many did not end up in camps or makeshift settlements and consequently struggled to obtain shelter, food, water and sanitation; and thirdly, that the effect of displacement appeared to reduce the ability of IDPs to count on protection from their own clan: even where they fled to a traditional area for their clan, the pressures of numbers and scarce resources could mean that newcomers were not supported or absorbed by the local community.\n65. With regard to the situation in Mogadishu, the AIT considered that:\n\u201cthe movements of population out of Mogadishu in the past two years have been unprecedented. UN sources have estimated (at various times) that 400,000, up to as many as 750,000 (or around one third to a half), of the population of Mogadishu have been displaced. An 8 April 2008 Voice of America report states that two thirds of Mogadishu has been turned into an urban battleground. Since the beginning of 2008 there have been significantly fewer returns. Whatever the precise figures, it is clear that the ongoing violence has forced substantial numbers to flee the city more than once and flight seems an ongoing process: the IRIN report of 29 September 2008 cites Elman estimates that 18,500 people recently fled their homes due to the fighting and shelling (COIS, A 4). The COIS Reply dated 24 October 2008 states that: \u201c[a]ccording to the UNHCR an estimated 5,500 people were displaced from the city during the week and over 61,000 since 21 September 2008\u201d. Armed clashes have increasingly destroyed housing, market areas (Bakara market has been deliberately shelled) and infrastructure and the recent closure of the airport is likely to make matters in Mogadishu worse. According to Grayson and Munk, the aid community has been largely ineffective in providing the necessary aid to those who have stayed in Mogadishu (Nairobi evidence 65). They also state that Mogadishu is a \u201cghost town\u201d and that only the most vulnerable remain there.\u201d\n66. It concluded that since HH the situation in Mogadishu had changed significantly, both in terms of the extent of population displacement away from the city, the intensity of the fighting and the security conditions there. On the available evidence the AIT considered that Mogadishu was no longer safe as a place to live for the great majority of its citizens. It did not rule out that there might be certain individuals who on the facts might be considered to be able to live safely in the city, for example if they had close connections with powerful actors in Mogadishu, such as prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs. However, barring cases of this kind, in the case of persons found to come from Mogadishu who were returnees from the United Kingdom, the AIT found that they would face on return a real risk of persecution or serious harm and it was reasonably likely, if they tried staying there, that they would soon be forced to leave or that they would decide not to try to live there in the first place.\n67. Nevertheless, the AIT were not persuaded that the situation in central and southern Somalia had reached the threshold where civilians per se or Somali civilian IDPs per se could be said to face a real risk of persecution, serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention. First, although the levels of violence had increased in intensity, the numbers of those killed and wounded was not of great magnitude. Secondly, while the humanitarian situation was dire, it did not appear that civilians per se faced a real risk of denial of basic food and shelter and other bare necessities of life. Thirdly, while there was evidence of attacks on IDPs, in view of the huge numbers of people displaced (over a million according to some reports), it appeared that the great majority of IDPs were able to travel and subsist in IDP camps or settlements without serious setbacks.\n68. Rather, the AIT assessment of the extent to which IDPs would face greater or lesser hardships, at least outside Mogadishu, would vary depending on a number of factors. In particular, the AIT noted that IDPs from more influential clans appeared to have a better chance of being tolerated in the area to which they fled; IDPs with a traditional clan area that they could travel to, especially if they had close relatives or close clan affiliations in that area, appeared to have better prospects of finding safety and support (although not if the area concerned was already saturated with fellow IDPs); those who lacked recent experience of living in Somalia appeared more likely to have difficulty dealing with the changed environment in which clan loyalties had to some extent fractured; persons returning to their home area from the United Kingdom could be perceived as having relative wealth and might be more susceptible to extortion, abduction and the like; those who lived in areas not particularly affected by the fighting and which were not seen as strategically important to any of the main parties to the conflict would appear less subject to security problems; women and girls faced the additional risks of rape, abduction and harassment; the prevailing economic conditions in the area would also be relevant, bearing in mind Somalia\u2019s history of droughts, poor harvests and rising food prices.\n69. The AIT recognised that there had been a significant change in the clan-based character of Somali society since HH was promulgated. Clan protection was not as effective as it had been in the early 1990s and conflicts over scarce resources had complicated the situation and made it unpredictable. This did not mean, however, that the clan or sub-clan had ceased to be the primary entity to which individuals turned for protection.\n70. As regards internal relocation, whether those whose home area was Mogadishu (or indeed any other part of central and southern Somalia) would be able to relocate in safety and without undue hardship would depend on the evidence as to the general circumstances in the relevant parts of central and southern Somalia and the personal circumstances of the applicant. Whether or not it was likely that relocation would mean that they had to live in an IDP camp would be an important but not necessarily a decisive factor.\n71. The AIT considered the safety of en route travel from Mogadishu International Airport, which was the point of return for anyone being removed to central and southern Somalia. The AIT noted that:\n\u201cThe airport is one of the facilities patrolled by AMISON troops (COIS, 27.13). According to Somalia Humanitarian Overview, September 2008, normally at least 5 commercial flights arrive and depart on a weekly basis to and from the rest of Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti and Dubai. The COIS Reply of 24 October 2008 notes that it is expected in the next month or so that thousands will leave via MIA to perform Haj in Saudi Arabia. At the time of HH, the airport was fully operational with flights arriving and departing regularly. However in 2008 the situation has been unsettled. There were attacks of some kind in January 2008 and the downing of a plane by a missile in March 2008 (COIS, 27.13). The airport was attacked by insurgents on 1 June 2008 as the President\u2019s plane left for talks in Djibouti. On 14 September 2008 a group identifying themselves as Al Shabab threatened to shut the airport down, although a counter-report from Union of Islamic Courts said that the Islamist forces did not intend to close it. It was closed on 16 September. On 28 September there were mortar attacks on it upon the arrival of an AMISON military plane (COIS, A.2). A Press TV cutting dated 2 October 2008 states that 5 heavy mortars landed inside MIA injuring a number of soldiers. The assailants apparently targeted a plane trying to land. A COIS Reply dated 15 October 2008 reports an Al Shabab source as saying that on 9 October a civilian plane carrying 120 Somali deportees from Saudi Arabia managed to land without incident. A 13 October press report refers to several mortar attacks on the airport. We were told by the respondent at the outset of the hearing that removals to Somalia were temporarily suspended because of travel documentation problems, but it may well be, in the light of these recent developments, that for the immediate future at least, there would be difficulties in ensuring safe arrival in any event.\u201d\n72. In HH the AIT had concluded that those moving around Mogadishu and the environs would in general not be at risk of serious harm at checkpoints, although it left open the possibility that the situation might be different if a person were likely to encounter a non-Transitional Federal Government checkpoint alone, without friends, family or other clan members. However, in AM the AIT noted that from the second half of 2007 United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimate of the number of roadblocks/checkpoints in central and southern Somalia showed an increase from 238 in July 2007 to 400 in July 2008 and considerably more than half were under the control of insurgents. Nevertheless, while the AIT found that the Transitional Federal Government appeared by and large to have lost control of many of the roadblocks and checkpoints in central and southern Somalia, the evidence continued to indicate that they retained control of the main road from the airport into Mogadishu. While there was some evidence that the road came under attack from insurgents on a daily basis, there was clearly a great deal of ongoing movement of people along the roads in central and southern Somalia and in and around the airport and the AIT did not consider that the available evidence demonstrated a real risk en route of persecution or serious harm for travellers from the airport to Mogadishu.\n#### D. HH (Somalia), AM (Somalia), J (Somalia) and MA (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 426\n73. One of the applicants in HH and one of the applicants in AM were granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Their appeals were joined to those of two other Somali applicants.\n74. HH contended that the AIT had erred in its application of the provisions of article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive as it had held first, that the notion of an \u201cindividual threat\u201d required a \u201cdifferential impact \u201d and secondly, that article 15(c) did not add anything to Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention. Before the Court of Appeal, the Secretary of State for the Home Department accepted that the AIT had erred in its interpretation of article 15(c), but submitted that the error was not material. The Court of Appeal held that if the correct (post-Elgafaji) approach to article 15(c) had been applied to the facts found by the AIT, it was inevitable that it would have found that the population of Mogadishu as a whole was not subject to such a high level of indiscriminate violence as to justify the conclusion that merely to be there attracted entitlement to subsidiary protection. Consequently, the Court of Appeal dismissed HH\u2019s appeal on the ground that the error of law was not material.\n75. The AIT had accepted that AM was from Jowhar. It noted that there was no longer any significant fighting there but accepted that there was evidence that en route travel to Jowhar was hazardous. Nevertheless, the AIT held that it was not empowered to consider the risk faced in making the journey: rather, it was for the Secretary of State for the Home Department, in finalising the removal arrangements, to satisfy herself that there would be safe en route travel for AM. AM appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that this was not a lawful approach. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that in any case in which it could be shown either directly or by implication what route and method of return was envisaged, the AIT was required by law to consider and determine any challenge to the safety of that route or method. The AIT therefore fell into error as it had declined to consider AM\u2019s safety on return. The Court of Appeal remitted the case to the AIT to consider this issue.\n76. J had sought judicial review of the Secretary of State for the Home Department\u2019s refusal to accept as a fresh claim her submissions about the situation facing her were she to be returned to Somalia. The Administrative Court had held that if the removal directions had indicated that J was expected to go by road from Mogadishu International Airport to her home town, the evidence would have given her a strongly arguable case for judicial review. However, as the detail or method of return was neither clearly nor necessarily implicit within the immigration decision, the judicial review application had been refused. J appealed to the Court of Appeal. For the same reasons adopted in AM\u2019s case, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. The Court of Appeal indicated (on an obiter basis) that the Qualification Directive and the Asylum Procedures Directive read together required that the issues of safety during return (as opposed to technical obstacles during return) should be considered as part of the decision on entitlement. Only technical obstacles could legitimately be deferred to the point at which removal directions were being made or considered. If there was a real issue of safety on return the Secretary of State had to engage with it in his decision on entitlement to protection. If he failed to do so, the appeal tribunal would have to deal with the issue. In any case, the decision on entitlement had to be made within a reasonable time and could not be left until the Secretary of State was in a position to set safe removal directions.\n77. MA appealed against the rejection of his Article 3 claims by the AIT. In particular, he complained that the AIT had misdirected itself because it had focused on his failure to tell the truth when it should have asked whether there was evidence relating to his own particular situation, even ignoring his own rejected testimony, which would support his contention that there was a real risk on return. The Court of Appeal accepted that the AIT had adopted the wrong approach, apparently considering that the applicant\u2019s lies had disabled it from reaching a conclusion on the Article 3 risk. Had it made an assessment on the basis of the available evidence, it would have had to have concluded that the applicant was at risk of Article 3 ill-treatment on return. The Court of Appeal noted that following AM, the Country Guidance relating to Mogadishu was such that most potential returnees would be entitled to subsidiary protection under article 15 of the Qualification Directive. It therefore followed that only those Somalis who could get without undue risk to a place of safety or who had access to protection against the endemic dangers could properly be deported or returned. It was accepted that MA was from a minority clan, that he had not been in Somalia for 15 years, and that for much of that time he had been in detention. There was therefore sufficient evidence before the AIT to at least establish a real risk that he would not have the necessary contacts in Mogadishu to afford him the necessary protection.\n#### E. AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC)\n78. In AM (Evidence \u2013 route of return) Somalia [2011] UKUT (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that the First Tier Tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the applicant could safely reach his home area of Afgooye from Mogadishu International Airport. However, on reconsideration the Tribunal was not satisfied that returning him would give rise to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. In particular, it found that travel took place with some degree of frequency from the airport to the city of Mogadishu and into other areas of Somalia; that as the applicant had lived in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, he would be well able to anticipate and comply with the requirements of al-Shabaab; that there was nothing which would put him at any risk were he to encounter a Transitional Federal Government checkpoint; that the evidence did not support a finding that all men or young men were at risk of forced recruitment by al-Shabaab; and, that as the applicant was not found to be a minority clan member, and as his uncle had been able to fund his departure from Somalia, he would be able to avoid foreseeable risks and pay the relatively modest sums demanded at checkpoints.\n#### F. Judgment of 24 February 2011 (UM 10061-09) of the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal (Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen)\n79. The Swedish Migration Court of Appeal, which is the court of final instance in immigration cases, found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout the whole of southern and central Somalia which was sufficiently serious to expose the Somali applicant to a risk of serious harm, even though he could not demonstrate that he would be specifically targeted. The court had regard to many reports which indicated that the fighting had increased in recent months and that the situation had become very unstable and unpredictable. Moreover, due to the worsening security situation, the presence of the United Nations and other international organisations had decreased and, as a consequence, detailed and updated information was hard to come by. Although the safety level in Somaliland and Puntland was considered to be acceptable, a Somali returnee could only gain admittance to those areas if he was seen as belonging or having another connection to them. As that was not the case with the applicant, the court concluded that he could not internally relocate and that he should thus be given a residence permit and subsidiary protection in Sweden.\n### VII. RELEVANT COUNTRY INFORMATION\n#### A. United Kingdom Government Reports\n##### 1. Somalia: Report of Fact-Finding Mission to Nairobi,\n8 \u2013 15 September 2010\n80. The fact-finding mission interviewed a number of anonymous sources, including international NGOs, security advisors and diplomatic sources, about the current security and humanitarian situation in southern and central Somalia. In particular, the mission sought to obtain information on which groups controlled which areas, how easy it was to travel between different areas, the security and human rights situation, and the conditions in the IDP camps.\n81. Sources indicated that control of Mogadishu was divided between the Transitional Federal Government, backed by AMISOM troops, and\nal-Shabaab. Although the sources had different views on which groups controlled which districts, they mostly agreed that the Transitional Federal Government controlled the airport, the seaport, Villa Somalia and the road between the airport and Villa Somalia.\n82. Sources indicated that the security situation in Mogadishu was poor, with thousands of civilians killed in the fighting between AMISOM and\nal-Shabaab. Areas controlled by al-Shabaab were at risk of shelling by AMISOM, while areas controlled by AMISOM were at risk of shelling by al-Shabaab. All parties to the conflict were guilty of indiscriminate shelling. Violence was sporadic and rape was an issue in many areas. Consequently, there was a constant movement of IDPs into and out of the city. However, one diplomatic source suggested that it would be possible to live in\nnon-conflict areas of the city, which were generally considered to be safe.\n83. Sources also indicated that the nature of al-Shabaab violence had become more sophisticated over the past twelve months as foreign fighters had brought with them new tactics and techniques. They not only carried out targeted attacks against AMISOM troops and Transitional Federal Government ministers and MPs, but they also carried out random killings of civilians in Mogadishu in order to create disorder and chaos.\n84. The report noted that there were regular flights into Somalia, most of which were destined for Mogadishu International Airport. The EU Special Representative informed the Mission that 15-18 flights arrived in Mogadishu each day. An airplane captain working for African Express Airways also told the Mission that his airline had carried 12,000 passengers into Mogadishu in the first eight months of 2010.\n85. The road between the airport and Mogadishu was controlled by the Transitional Federal Government with AMISOM support and these groups managed all checkpoints along the route. It would not be particularly dangerous for ordinary Somalis unless they found themselves \u201cin the wrong place at the wrong time\u201d. However, there were reports of a failed attack on the airport on 9 September 2010 and some sources suggested that contacts were required in order to make the journey from the airport. The EU Special Representative for the EU Delegation on Somalia indicated that those members of the diaspora who regularly travelled to Mogadishu were\nwell-connected and that mobility was limited unless the individual was aligned with a militia. Likewise, a representative from an international NGO indicated that \u201cany Somalis returning to Mogadishu International Airport would need a lot of preparation and would need to ensure they had contacts in Mogadishu\u201d.\n86. A representative from one international NGO suggested that al-Shabaab knew who was landing at the airport as they were receiving information from Transitional Federal Government soldiers based there.\n87. Most of the sources interviewed agreed that Somalis were able to move around within Mogadishu without much restriction. Two sources described the checkpoints in the city as \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cvariable\u201d as they tended to change according to fighting areas and the level of control of specific groups. One source suggested that checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government or Hizbul Islam were more difficult to negotiate as they were operated with less discipline and normally demanded money. Al-Shabaab checkpoints normally checked that people were obeying their code of behaviour and would therefore stop women travelling alone. Some individuals operating these checkpoints would punish those who were not acting according to al-Shabaab\u2019s rules.\n88. Contrary to the majority opinion, the EU Special Representative informed the fact-finding mission that all civilians in Mogadishu would either be aligned to a militia or completely unable to get out of the town. The Special Representative even suggested that some Somalis were unable to leave their own district.\n89. There was no consensus on which groups controlled the other regions in southern and central Somalia, although all agreed that al-Shabaab controlled most of the land south of a line drawn between Beletweyne and Dhusarmareb. Militias broadly aligned with the Transitional Federal Government controlled pockets of land on the Ethiopian border. Hizbul Islam was nominally in control of some small areas, including parts of the Afgooye Corridor, but al-Shabaab\u2019s influence in these areas was significant. Finally, the region of Galmudug was controlled by a local clan-based administration which acted under the umbrella of Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca.\n90. Outside Mogadishu, people were generally permitted to travel within the areas controlled by al-Shabaab although they could encounter difficulties at checkpoints if they were not obeying al-Shabaab rules. Although al-Shabaab had endeavoured to remove \u201cillegal\u201d checkpoints, a number of sources indicated that some clan militia checkpoints remained. The evidence appeared to suggest that it was possible to negotiate the various checkpoints, although a certain amount of risk was involved.\n91. A diplomatic source stated that young men travelling in al-Shabaab held areas could be targeted by al-Shabaab for recruitment. This was supported by an international NGO, which advised that forced recruitment was becoming systematic. Young men were asked to register with\nal-Shabaab, including those who were stopped at checkpoints.\n92. A number of sources considered the areas controlled by al-Shabaab to be stable and generally safe for those Somalis who were able to \u201cplay the game\u201d and avoid the unnecessary attention of al-Shabaab. One the other hand, one international NGO believed that there were \u201cno safe areas in southern-central Somalia as long as al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam were present\u201d. Another NGO indicated that everywhere in southern and central Somalia had been affected by violations of international humanitarian law and by a situation of generalised violence and displacement over the past three years on account of the expansion of the insurgency outside Mogadishu. Finally, a diplomatic source stated that \u201ceverywhere is volatile and can change at any time\u201d.\n93. With regard to the human rights situation, forced recruitment of adults and children appeared to be an emerging problem, particularly for those displaced in the Afgooye Corridor. Sources suggested that all parties to the conflict recruited children, although it was not certain that the Transitional Federal Government forcibly recruited them. Child recruitment was, however, very common in al-Shabaab areas, as they would forcibly recruit the eldest son from local families, some of whom were as young as ten years old. Adult males were also forced to register with al-Shabaab in Merca and Doble.\n94. Moreover, the sources indicated that in al-Shabaab areas, human rights were practically non-existent because of the organisation\u2019s interpretation of Sharia law, which was not in accordance with the beliefs of ordinary Somalis. Consequently, people lived in fear as there were serious punishments if al-Shabaab orders were not obeyed. Women in particular were routinely targeted and were not permitted to engage in trade. In addition, al-Shabaab had made a concerted effort to drive NGOs out of its areas by a number of means, including demanding payment of a \u201cregistration fee\u201d of up to USD 15,000, looting warehouses and threatening workers. In some cases al-Shabaab had stolen aid and confiscated the assets of NGOs to sell for profit. There was therefore no international NGO presence in al-Shabaab controlled areas and health and feeding programmes had been stopped, with significant consequences for the civilian population.\n95. Finally, sources were asked about the conditions in IDP camps. They indicated that although those with resources had left Mogadishu, there were some 250,000 people displaced within the city and no humanitarian assistance was available to them. Estimates suggested that there were a further 200,000 to 500,000 people in the Afgooye Corridor, which had become increasingly urbanised. It was difficult to give an exact number of the people based in the corridor because, due to the nature of the fighting, a lot of people were going back and forward to Mogadishu. Moreover, access for NGOs was difficult as the corridor was controlled by \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who controlled who and what moved into and out of the area. These \u201cgatekeepers\u201d tended to be opportunists who were not aligned to any particular group but they were able to make assistance from NGOs very difficult. Two NGOs said that it was incredibly difficult to access the corridor and, where access was possible, aid was often diverted. Moreover, landlords in the area were either selling the land that the IDPs lived on or were charging rent that they could not afford, forcing them to move on.\n96. One international NGO believed that there was a hierarchy within the camps, but did not know whether it was based on clan membership or length of residence. Consequently, it could not be guaranteed that majority clan members would not face problems within the IDP camps.\n97. The sources were not aware of any other significant IDP settlements within Somalia.\n##### 2. United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Operational Guidance Note\n98. Operational Guidance Notes (\u201cOGNs\u201d) are produced by the Border and Immigration Agency of the Home Office. They evaluate the general, political and human rights situation in a country and provide guidance on the nature and handling of the most common type of claim.\n99. The OGN on Somalia of 1 July 2010 described how fighting by Transitional Federal Government troops, allied militias, and AMISOM forces against anti-government forces in southern and central Somalia had resulted in widespread human rights abuses, including the killing of thousands of civilians, the displacement of more than one million people and widespread property damage, particularly in Mogadishu. However, a fall in clashes between government troops and insurgents had led to a substantial drop in the numbers of civilians killed in fighting in Mogadishu in 2009. The Mogadishu-based Elman Peace and Human Rights Organisation stated that 1,739 civilians were killed in fighting in 2009, down from 7,574 in 2008 and 8,636 in 2007. At least 4,911 civilians were wounded and 3,900 families displaced by clashes in 2009.\n100. The report noted that while Mogadishu remained the focus of the insurgency, fighting had occurred in other parts of the country, including Beletweyne, Kismayo, the Gedo and Bakool regions, from Jowhar to Harardhere and around the central towns of Dhusamareb and Beletweyne.\n101. The report indicated that restrictions on movement within Somalia had reduced significantly compared to when the AIT considered the situation in AM and AM (Somalia). In particular, checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government had decreased and there were no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints in 2009. Al-Shabaab had established checkpoints at the exit/entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons. It checked goods, searched people and ensured that its strict Islamic codes were enforced, but it did not collect money. There were also reports that Al-Shabaab had eradicated extortion, robbery and murder from bandits in areas it controlled.\n102. With the exception of Mogadishu, there were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns, as was common in previous years. There were, however, several checkpoints on the route from Mogadishu towards the Central Regions and some precautions could be necessary, particularly during militia fighting. There was no evidence that those not of adverse interest to the Transitional Federal Government,\nal-Shabaab or groups such as Hizbul Islam or Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca, would be unable to pass through checkpoints safely. During overland trips clan protection was not required unless ongoing animosities between two rival clans were involved. Individuals would not generally need an escort, but if they considered an escort to be necessary, it would be feasible for them to arrange one either before or after arrival. It would therefore be feasible for many to return to their home areas from Mogadishu International Airport as most areas were more accessible than previously.\n103. The report also noted that it was possible for Somalis to fly from Mogadishu International Airport directly to Hargeisa, in Somaliland, a region which was widely considered to be relatively safe. However, the authorities in Somaliland, like the authorities in Puntland, would only admit those who originated from the territory or those who had close affiliation to the territory through clan membership. In Somaliland, the majority clan was the Isaaq.\n104. With regard to the human rights situation, the report noted that:\n\u201cAl-Shabaab currently controls much of southern and central Somalia, including large portions of Mogadishu. The Transitional Federal Government has maintained control of a few areas in the south east of the city, government installations, the Presidential palace and strategic locations such as the airport and seaport. Al-Shabaab controls large portions of Mogadishu including the north and north-east parts of the city, the main stadium and the main market. It controls nearly all of Middle and Lower Jubba regions, Gedo region, Bay region, Bakool region, and parts of Lower Shabelle region. This includes control of the key port cities of Kismayo and Marka and the Kenya border town of Diif. It also wields significant influence in Middle Shabelle and Hiraan region.\nThe human rights situation has deteriorated particularly in areas controlled by\nal-Shabaab and allied extremist groups. Al-Shabaab and other armed groups have continued to violate women\u2019s rights in southern and central Somalia. Women face arbitrary detention, restriction of movement and other forms of abuse for failure to obey orders, including non-observance of dress codes. There is a rising pattern of inhuman and degrading treatment, including stoning, amputations, floggings and corporal punishment. Men too are subjected to inhuman and cruel treatment for their illicit relationship with women and other offences such as \u2018spying\u2019. Journalists have been repeatedly subjected to threats and short-term arbitrary detentions, particularly in Baidoa and Kismayo. Al-Shabaab has increasingly targeted civil society groups, peace activists, media and human rights organisations. Humanitarian assistance has been severely hampered by the prevailing insecurity and threats specifically targeting humanitarian agencies. In southern and central Somalia there is evidence that children are being exposed to recruitment into armed forces by all parties to the conflict.\u201d\n105. In respect of the humanitarian situation, the report indicated that by November 2009 the total number of displaced persons had reached 1.55 million, 93% of whom were concentrated in southern and central areas, including 524,000 in the Afgooye corridor. The security situation was having a negative impact on the relief operation. Rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations, as well as the imposition of demands from armed groups, had made it virtually impossible for the World Food Programme (\u201cWFP\u201d) to continue reaching people in need in southern Somalia. Inflammatory statements by al-Shabaab against relief organisations, threats against humanitarian staff, explicit rejection of foreign food aid and demands for fees had all worsened.\n106. The report concluded that while the general humanitarian situation in southern and central Somalia was poor, it was not so serious as to cause, in itself, a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Aid agencies were subjected to obstructions and dangers in delivering aid to IDPs but most of those in need continued to be reached and efforts were being strengthened to sustain critical food operations in southern and central Somalia. Each case therefore had to be considered on its individual merits in order to assess whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, the Article 3 threshold was met.\n#### B. United States\u2019 Government Reports\n1. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, Somalia, 2009 (11 March 2010)\n107. The report indicated that the Transitional Federal Government\u2019s respect for human rights had improved. However, the poor human rights situation in Somalia had deteriorated further during the year, especially in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab and allied extremist groups. Human rights abuses included unlawful and politically motivated killings, kidnappings, torture, rape, amputations, beatings, official impunity, harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, and arbitrary arrest and detention.\n108. With regard to movement within Somalia, the report indicated that checkpoints operated by the Transitional Federal Government and its associated militias had decreased. According to a report by UNOCHA, al-Shabaab established checkpoints at the exit/entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons. There were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns, as was common in previous years. There were also no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints during the year.\n2. \u201cSomalia: Current Conditions and Prospects for a Lasting Peace\u201d, Congressional Research Service, 16 December 2010\n109. The report noted that the humanitarian situation in Somalia remained dire as the fighting in Mogadishu had added more challenges to already poor conditions on the ground. An estimated 1.1 million people had been displaced and more than 475,000 had fled to neighbouring countries in the past two years. Targeted attacks on humanitarian groups had made delivery of assistance difficult and the Obama Administration had suspended assistance in areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n#### C. The Norwegian Directorate of Immigration Country of Origin Centre Somalia: Security and Conflict in the South (23 August 2010)\n110. The report noted that the situation in southern Somalia and in Mogadishu in particular was unstable and the power balance in the regions, districts and urban areas could change almost from day to day. Consequently, information on area control could become out of date very quickly.\n111. It was clear, however, that the military and political situation remained extremely complicated. Large areas of southern Somalia were controlled by al-Shabaab and other Islamist groups in opposition to the authorities. Many areas of Mogadishu had been the scene of shooting, shelling and fighting between Islamists and Government forces supported by AMISOM. In spite of a certain amount of stability in parts of the country, the civilian population was still the victim of indiscriminate violence, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than previously. Leading observers agreed that the situation was fragile as the Islamist groups had the will and means to continue to fight, while the Transitional Federal Government was weak and probably would not survive without the presence of AMISOM.\n112. The UN Special Envoy for Human Rights, together with a number of other international observers, noted that the arrival of foreign jihadists in Somalia had resulted in al-Shabaab operations becoming \u201cprofessionalised\u201d, which meant that they were implemented with greater precision and brutality. According to a number of observers, individual al-Shabaab cells were controlled by foreign jihadists who did not wish for peace or to enter into any form of dialogue with the authorities.\n113. With regard to the humanitarian situation, the report noted that while the nutritional situation was expected to improve in the year ahead on account of a good harvest, the food security situation remained poor. Food prices were high and access to clean drinking water remained a considerable problem.\n114. Estimates indicated that the total number of displaced persons in Somalia was around 1.3 million. Resources in local areas were stretched to the maximum as the displaced from Mogadishu sought refuge in traditional clan areas. While clan members were prepared to share what resources they had as far as possible, displaced persons without clan connections did not have that safety net and were therefore in a more difficult position. However, the report quoted the UN Special Envoy as stating:\n\u201cMonitoring the human rights situation in south and central Somalia remains very difficult due to the serious constraints on gathering information owing to security conditions. The independent expert was himself unable to visit the region. Nevertheless, major human rights concerns have been documented and the independent expert remains deeply concerned at the deterioration of the situation.\u201d\n115. The report noted that freedom of movement in Somalia had improved since January 2009 and the general impression was that the population could travel relatively freely in both government controlled areas and areas controlled by other groups. The removal of road blocks had had a positive effect on criminality as cases of \u201crape and run\u201d had previously been widespread in these areas. However, in spite of the improvements, restrictions imposed by al-Shabaab on women restricted their freedom of movement and had a negative impact on their families, which were often dependant on women\u2019s income from trading.\n116. International organisations had increasingly been the target of violent attacks since 2008 and, because of the safety risk, only a few international representatives remained in southern Somalia. Like the UN and foreign embassies, business was run from main offices in Nairobi while local employees were responsible for work on the ground in Somalia. Local human rights organisations could not publish detailed reports for fear of their own safety. However, aid work in Somalia could be risky for local employees as they were increasingly coming under attack.\n117. In any case, aid organisations had limited access in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab. In January 2010 the WFP decided to suspend its activities in the al-Shabaab controlled areas. This has had consequences for the population in Lower Shabelle Bay, Bakool and Gedo as access to the necessary food supplies and other aid was limited. Moreover, at the beginning of August 2010, al-Shabaab ordered the Adventist Development and Relief Agency, World Vision and Diakonia out of the areas under their control on the ground that they were operating missionary activities. With these three organisations gone, very few international aid organisations remained in place in southern Somalia.\n118. With regard to the situation in Mogadishu, the report noted that conditions in the different areas varied and there was a difference between the northern and southern parts of the capital. The areas of Hodan, Hawl, Wadaag, Wardhingley, Yaqshiid, Bondheere, Shibis and Abdulaziz were the hardest hit by shelling and attacks. To a lesser extent, the districts of Medina, Dharkley, Hamar Weyne, Waaberi and Hamar Jajab were also affected by the fighting. However, the report noted that the situation was unpredictable and could easily change. For example, the Karaan district in the north had previously been considered relatively peaceful but was now shot to pieces and all its inhabitants had fled.\n119. According to a well-informed international aid worker, ten people per week died in Mogadishu due to fighting. It was difficult to estimate how many of the dead were civilians. It was also difficult accurately to estimate the number of displaced. According to the UNCHR, there were around 370,000 displaced persons in Mogadishu and 360,000 in the Afgooye Corridor. However, it was possible that there were great margins of error as the UN estimates were based on satellite images and it was thought that many houses had been built to mislead aid organisations. Nevertheless, well-informed sources indicated that the situation in Somalia today was much more difficult than it had been at the beginning of the 1990s as international organisations were no longer able to carry out their tasks. Poverty was more widespread in Mogadishu than it had been previously and it was therefore more difficult to help those in need. In addition, the clan system had been weakened.\n120. Outside Mogadishu the fighting was mostly localised around certain key areas and towns. Strategic towns such as Kismayo, Beletweyne and various towns in the Galgaduud had changed hands many times in recent years and there were also tensions in Bakool and Gedo. However, the main challenge for most of the population of southern Somalia was humanitarian. Fifteen percent of all children under five in southern Somalia were malnourished and medical treatment was limited, especially in villages, where it was estimated that there was one doctor per 25,000 inhabitants.\n#### D. United Nations Reports\n##### 1. The UN Secretary-General\u2019s Reports\n121. In his report to the Security Council on 11 May 2010, the Secretary General noted that there had been increased fighting in southern and central Somalia during the first three months of 2010. Over 110,000 people had been displaced during this period. In addition to the fighting in Mogadishu, there was also continued fighting between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam in Lower Juba and Lower Shabelle, and between al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca in the central region. National United Nations staff faced direct threats from armed groups in these areas and the presence of international staff in these regions was restricted.\n122. The security situation continued to have a direct impact on the provision of humanitarian aid. The report noted that on 28 February 2008 al-Shabaab called for the termination of all World Food Programme (\u201cWFP\u201d) operations inside Somalia, and on 1 March 2010 and 7 April 2010 WFP compounds in Buale and Wajid were occupied by al-Shabaab. There had been no food distribution to over 300,000 IDPs in the Afgooye corridor since November 2009 owing to inaccessibility and another 1.1 million intended beneficiaries were not receiving food distributions throughout the south and central regions.\n123. In his report to the Security Council on 9 September 2010, the Secretary General noted that volatility and insecurity had once again increased in Mogadishu. AMISOM and the Transitional Federal Government frequently engaged the insurgents in response to mortar fire and direct attacks and military operations to secure positions in key districts of Mogadishu led to fierce battles. Moreover, the frequency of attacks with improvised explosive devices had led to an increase in civilian casualties during the reporting period. According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 1,600 civilian casualties were admitted to the two main hospitals in Mogadishu from 20 March 2010 to 11 July 2010. That figure, which included almost 400 children under the age of 5 and 48 registered deaths, had left Mogadishu\u2019s already weak health services struggling to cope with the casualties. He also reported that beyond Mogadishu, sporadic clashes between al-Shabaab and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca continued in the central regions and the continuing insecurity had hampered UN operations in Somalia by limiting freedom of movement for UN staff and contractors. In July 2010 al-Shabaab seized the compound of the World Food Programme and the houses of six national staff.\n124. The ongoing conflict, particularly in Mogadishu, had displaced 179,000 people in the first quarter and 75,000 people in the second quarter of 2010.\n125. In the Secretary-General\u2019s report of 9 November 2010 on children and armed conflict in Somalia, he noted that civilians, including children, continued to be the majority of casualties in Somalia, primarily as a result of being caught in the crossfire between the parties to the conflict, shelling and explosions. During 2009 3.64 million people, including approximately 1.8 million children, relied on humanitarian assistance. However, food supplies remained disrupted, access to clean water and medical assistance hindered, and hospitals were stretched to capacity. As from January 2010, food distribution by the World Food Programme was disrupted in all areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n126. Moreover, the climate of violence and impunity exacerbated grave violations of children\u2019s rights as individuals were taking advantage of the lack of rule of law and the availability of arms to commit violent crimes against children and other vulnerable members of the population. This was borne out by evidence of rising levels of acts of sexual violence against children. Most at risk were women and girls living on the streets or in open and unprotected settlements for IDPs. In addition, available information indicated that al-Shabaab had undertaken systematic and widespread recruitment of children for use in the conflict. Indeed, it was alleged that at the Galduuma base between Bay and Lower Shabelle, al-Shabaab had 1,800 children, some as young as 9 years old.\n127. In his most recent report to the Security Council, dated 28 April 2011, the Secretary General stated that a major military offensive against Al-Shabaab had begun on 19 February 2011. The offensive by the Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama\u2019a and other groups allied with the Transitional Federal Government against Al-Shabaab in southern central Somalia had focused on the Ethiopia-Kenya-Somalia border. Hostilities centred on the Gedo, Bay and Bakool regions, with armed conflict most prevalent in Bula Hawa and, to a lesser extent, in the vicinity of Beletweyne and Dolo. Troops allied with the Transitional Federal Government had taken control of the town of Dhobley, close to the Kenyan border, on 3 April 2011. Reports of heavy casualties and intensified recruitment efforts on the part of\nAl-Shabaab suggested that the group\u2019s capabilities might have been reduced. However, Al-Shabaab continued to receive arms and ammunition through southern Somali ports and acquire financial resources from extortion, illegal exports and taxation.\n2. Report of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia, Shamsul Bari (16 September 2010)\n128. At the date the report was drafted, heavy fighting had again broken out in Mogadishu and International Committee of the Red Cross reported that hospitals were swamped with war-wounded. According to a report by the Elman Peace Center of Somalia, in the first seven months of 2010 918 civilians died and 2,555 were injured as a result of the increased fighting and shelling. While most casualties appeared to have been the result either of attacks by al-Shabaab and its allies against Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces or retaliatory attacks by AMISOM, direct fighting between Islamists such as Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca and al-Shabaab combined with inter-clan clashes in central Somalia also contributed to the high number of deaths. In addition, reports indicated that parties to the conflict had failed to adhere to the principles of international humanitarian law relating to the protection of civilians as hostilities had been waged in urban areas and precautionary measures to avoid civilian casualties had been disregarded.\n129. With regard to the human rights situation in areas under\nal-Shabaab\u2019s control, United Nations Workers recorded reports of nine executions by firing squad or stoning, mostly for alleged spying or murder, five cases of amputation, mostly of suspected thieves, and the flogging or whipping of some twenty-eight individuals. In addition, seven cases of beheading were reported, including those of five workers allegedly killed in April 2010 because they were involved in reconstruction work at the Parliament, and two people were allegedly shot dead in June 2010 when they fled from a house in Mogadishu raided by Hizbul Islam because they were watching a World Cup match.\n130. Displacement also continued to be a problem. According to a UNHCR report, during the first seven months of 2010 50,065 Somalis sought refuge in neighbouring countries and over 200,000 were internally displaced. As of the end of July 2010, there were 600,484 Somali refugees, mainly hosted in Kenya, Yemen, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Tanzania and Uganda. In addition, 1.4 million Somalis were internally displaced. Assessments conducted revealed that there was a high prevalence of sexual violence in IDP camps, victims were generally of minority clan origin, bereft of clan protection and often forced to engage in risky coping mechanisms.\n131. Recruitment of children to be put on the front line remained an issue of major concern. Although recent media attention highlighted the presence of children within the ranks of forces linked to the Government, the majority of reports of new instances of child recruitment attributed responsibility to anti-Government elements.\n132. The report further noted that a public health crisis persisted in southern and central Somalia. While good rains between April and June 2010 had improved the food security situation, two million people (27 percent of the total population of Somalia) continued to face a humanitarian crisis. Moreover, the number of acutely malnourished children was estimated to be 230,000, of which 35,000 were severely malnourished, and the majority of these were in southern and central Somalia. The forced movement of people on account of the conflict also limited access to clean water and basic health services.\n3. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR): Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Somalia (\u201cthe Eligibility Guidelines\u201d), 5 May 2010\n133. UNHCR\u2019s Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Somalia (\u201cthe Eligibility Guidelines\u201d) were published on 5 May 2010. The Eligibility Guidelines noted that over the last three years there had been a consistent failure by all parties to respect basic principles of international humanitarian law, resulting in civilians regularly being caught in the cross-fire. Indiscriminate bombardment and military offensives were carried out in civilian areas with little or no regard for the rules of war and road-side and vehicle-borne bombs, grenade attacks in civilian areas, and deliberate attacks on civilian targets were all too frequent. Hospital records indicated that there were over 900 civilian casualties in Mogadishu in March and April 2010. Other estimates suggested that between 20 and 50 civilians were killed in Mogadishu each week.\n134. While the armed conflict was a major cause of displacement, the report noted that increasing numbers of Somalis were fleeing due to fear of persecution linked to the recent political and human rights situation. Others feared persecution due to perceived or actual contravention of traditional Somali social norms and practices. These groups included members of minority clans, women of specific profiles, victims of blood feuds, Christian converts, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals.\n135. Consequently, UNHCR concluded that the widespread disregard of their obligations under international law by all of the parties to the conflict and the reported scale of human rights violations made it clear that any person returned to southern and central Somalia would, solely on account of his or her presence there, face a real risk of serious harm. Moreover, UNHCR considered that there was no internal flight alternative available inside southern and central Somalia.\n136. UNHCR identified three potential agents of persecution. First, there were Islamic militant groups such as al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam. Both groups had been accused of, and both had admitted to, using the civilian population as human shields during military operations. Both groups also had conducted a systematic campaign of intimidation and assassination of civilians working for, associated with, or perceived to be collaborating with the Transitional Federal Government, AMISOM or the Ethiopian forces. They had also recruited young people and children into their ranks, often with threats of force and violence. Finally, they had set up Islamist administrations in areas under their control and issued decrees to restrict social behaviour. The enforcement of these decrees was often extreme and abusive and violations were punished severely by Sharia courts.\n137. Secondly, UNHCR indicated that business persons and civil society figures were particularly at risk as a result of the increased criminality in Mogadishu.\n138. Finally, UNHCR identified the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM as potential agents of persecution. It noted that both groups were accused of indiscriminately shelling civilian areas of Mogadishu in reprisal to mortar attacks launched by opposition forces. In addition, both groups had also been accused of firing at civilians.\n139. The report further noted that effective State protection was unavailable in southern and central Somalia given the situation of armed conflict and the inability of the government authorities to extend control over any territory outside a few districts in Mogadishu. Moreover, since 2007 clan protection had been undermined in Mogadishu and increasingly in other regions of southern and central Somalia by the ongoing conflict and by the diminution of the traditional clan systems of justice due to the favoured strict interpretations of Sharia law being implemented by\nal-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam in areas under their control.\n#### E. Non-Governmental Organisations\u2019 Reports\n1. Amnesty International: No End in Sight \u2013 The Ongoing Suffering of Somalia\u2019s Civilians (25 March 2010)\n140. Amnesty International noted that civilians in Mogadishu and other cities such as Dhusamareb in central Somalia and Beletweyne in the Hiran region continued to be killed and seriously injured due to the fighting between the armed opposition groups and pro-TGF forces. It noted that:\n\u201cno party to the conflict appears to take the necessary precautions to avoid loss of civilian life and injury, despite their obligations to do so under international humanitarian law. Civilians are often caught up in shelling and cross-fire by all parties to the conflict, resulting in death and injury to thousands. The fighting has provoked massive displacement within and outside cities in south and central Somalia and disruption of access to humanitarian aid, which are already curtailed by insecurity and the targeting of aid workers. Civilians living in areas controlled by armed opposition groups are also increasingly subject to abduction, torture and unlawful killings.\u201d\n141. With regard to the security situation in Mogadishu, they noted that:\n\u201cThere are near weekly incidents of fighting and shelling between armed opposition groups on one side and Transitional Federal Government forces and AMISOM troops on the other side, and near weekly reports of civilian deaths and injuries as a result. Armed opposition groups continue to launch attacks from areas inhabited or frequented by civilians in Mogadishu, endangering the lives of civilians. They fire mortars and heavy artillery in the direction of Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM bases, near which civilians live. Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces are repeatedly accused of responding by firing mortars and using other artillery weapons in the direction of the attackers. All sides to the conflict use mortars and other heavy artillery, weapons which are inherently indiscriminate when used in densely populated urban areas. Some sources have even alleged to Amnesty International that AMISOM is firing BM or \u201cKatyusha\u201d rockets when responding to attacks by armed opposition groups. These attacks and counter-attacks invariably result in civilian deaths and injuries.\u201d\n142. The report indicated that the delivery of emergency humanitarian aid to Somalia was shrinking, as aid workers were coming under attack and armed groups were imposing restrictions on the movement of international agencies working in areas under their control. In particular, it noted that:\n\u201cOn 11 October 2009, Hizbul Islam in the Banadir region asked all humanitarian organisations operating in areas under their control to register within 15 days and pay a registration fee by 25 October, whilst al-Shabab in the Juba region renewed their ban against any agency wishing to operate in the region, stating \u201cWe want our people to work for their life rather than depending on food aid.\u201d\nIn November, al-Shabaab in Bay and Bakool regions issued a list of 11 conditions which humanitarian organisations were required to adhere to in order to continue their work in the regions. These conditions reportedly included replacing all female staff members with men within three months, an agreement not to encourage secularism or democracy in their work and a payment of $20,000 US dollars every six months to the al-Shabaab administration. This was followed on 25 November by an al-Shabaab statement ordering the World Food Programme (WFP) to immediately cease the import of relief food to the country, accusing the organisation of acting as a barrier to self-sufficiency. All local businesspeople were ordered to terminate their contracts with the WFP and the organisation was ordered to empty their warehouses and\nfood-stocks by 1 January 2010.\u201d\n143. On 4 January 2010 the World Food Programme suspended its work in southern Somalia due to insecurity for its staff and the demands placed on them by parties to the conflict. Ninty-five percent of the areas from which the organisation had withdrawn were under the control of al-Shabaab, and al-Shabaab subsequently indicated that it would never permit the organisation to return. However, Amnesty International noted that over half of Somalia\u2019s population was dependent on food aid and many of those people lived in the areas that the WFP had withdrawn from.\n144. The report also noted that the WFP had experienced difficulties in delivering food to the IDP settlements in Afgooye, where some 360,000 persons displaced by the conflict were thought to live. On 28 February 2010 armed men stopped trucks transporting food aid from Mogadishu to Afgooye and the WFP have since stated that the last time they organised a general food distribution in Afgooye was in November 2009.\n##### 2. Amnesty International Briefing Paper, 18 October 2010\n145. The report indicated that civilians in Mogadishu continued to bear the brunt of the fighting and were often caught up in shelling and cross-fire by all parties to the conflict. There were nearly weekly incidents of fighting and shelling between armed opposition groups on one side and Transitional Federal Government forces and AMISOM troops on the other, and near weekly civilian deaths and injuries as a result.\n146. Medical records of the Daynile hospital on the outskirts of Mogadishu showed that for the first seven months of 2010 48 percent of its patients were suffering war-related injuries and 38 percent of those patients were women and children. Between June and July 2010, hundreds of civilians were killed or injured in Mogadishu. Some field reports claimed that there were as many as fifty deaths in one day, while UNHCR estimated that during the last week of August and the first week of September 2010, 230 civilians were killed and 400 were injured in fighting.\n147. Likewise, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res stated that between 23 August and 24 September 2010 its medical team in Daynile hospital treated 542 war-wounded people and performed over 200 surgeries. Following intense fighting on 23 September 2010 MSF treated 161 war-wounded patients in one day.\n148. The African Union recently signalled its intention to increase the number of AMISOM troops to 8,000 and Amnesty International believed that when this happened it was likely to result in more attacks against the force by armed Islamist groups and more retaliatory shelling by AMISOM.\n149. The report noted that the fighting had also caused the destruction of homes, the separation of families during chaotic flight, and massive displacement. UNHCR estimated that 42,400 people had been displaced from within and around Mogadishu since 23 August 2010, some 25,400 having fled Mogadishu and about 17,100 others having moved to different parts of the city.\n150. Al-Shabaab had also been seizing cities elsewhere in southern and central Somalia. In particular, there had been clashes in and around Kismayo, Dhusamareb, Beletweyne and Dobley. As a result, 29,000 civilians had been displaced from Dhusamareb and 25,000 had been displaced from Beletweyne. In addition to the fighting, al-Shabaab had also severely restricted humanitarian access in most of southern and central Somalia, putting civilians at risk. According to the report, humanitarian access in southern Somalia was at its lowest since the end of 2006.\n151. In addition to indiscriminate attacks and the situation of generalised violence, certain categories of people were particularly at risk of targeted killing. These categories included people linked with the Transitional Federal Government, civil society activists, aid workers and journalists. Children and young men were also at high risk of being forcibly recruited to fight for the armed Islamist groups.\n##### 3. Amnesty International \u2013 From Life Without Peace to Peace Without Life\n152. This report, which was published on 8 December 2010, focussed on the treatment of Somali refugees and asylum-seekers in Kenya, which hosted the largest number of Somali refugees in the region. As of September 2010, there were 338,151 registered refugees in the region, but it was estimated that the actual number was much higher.\n153. In 2007 the Kenyan authorities closed the country\u2019s border with Somalia and, according to estimates of Kenyan NGOs, thousands of Somali refugees were subsequently returned to Somalia by the Kenyan security forces. Some were expelled at the border while others were denied entry altogether. Many of these refugees were women and children who, according to UNHCRs eligibility guidelines, should have been granted international protection.\n154. Amnesty International also received numerous reports of the Kenyan police at the closed border threatening asylum-seekers with forced removal to Somalia in order to extort bribes or arresting or detaining asylum-seekers until they paid a bribe. In addition, Somali asylum-seekers were often arbitrarily arrested, detained and charged with \u201cillegal entry\u201d.\n155. Prior to the closure of the border, new refugees were registered and medically screened at an UNHCR-administered transit centre 15km from the border before being transported to refugee camps. When the border closed, this transit centre also closed with the consequence that refugees who made it to Kenya had to travel a further 80km to the refugee camps before they could be registered. This journey was often a dangerous one, during which Kenyan police were able to commit abuses against them with impunity.\n156. Approximately 280,000 registered Somali refugees were confined to three refugee camps in Dadaab in north eastern Kenya, which were originally intended to accommodate 90,000 refugees. As a result of the severe overcrowding, access to shelter, water, sanitation and other essential services was impeded. As no plots of land were available, new refugees could not build shelters and instead had to stay with relatives or clan members. In addition, the water infrastructure was only designed for one third of the number of people currently living in the camps and, as a result, many refugees complained that the allocation of water was insufficient. Those living at the edges of the camps often had to walk long distances to collect water.\n157. Refugees also complained of insecurity in the camps, which they attributed either to tensions between different clans or to the alleged presence of members of or sympathisers with al-Shabaab. Incidences of theft and sexual abuse were on the increase. Aid and protection agencies told Amnesty International that there were not enough police officers present in the camps adequately to address security incidents. In any case, refugees often distrusted the Kenyan police as many had been the victim of abuses by the security forces while on their way to the camps.\n158. In October 2009 reports emerged that the Kenyan security forces were recruiting Somali refugees for military training in order to fight for the Transitional Federal Government in Somalia. UNHCR subsequently launched an awareness campaign in the camps, warning refugees that they would lose their refugee status if they joined armed groups.\n159. Somali refugees in the Dadaab camps were generally not permitted to leave the camps, unless in exceptional circumstances, and they had almost no livelihood opportunities. They did, however, receive free humanitarian assistance in the camps.\n##### 4. Human Rights Watch: Harsh War, Harsh Peace\n160. In this report, published in April 2010, Human Rights Watch documented abuses by al-Shabaab, the Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM in Somalia. The report indicated that over the past year, hostilities had raged in strategically important areas, like Mogadishu, while much of the rest of Somalia enjoyed relative peace. However, the report concluded that both the inhabitants of the shattered capital and those living in more peaceful areas had endured devastating patterns of abuse.\n161. In Mogadishu and in other conflict areas in southern and central Somalia the fighting had exacted a heavy toll on civilians. In particular, the report noted that all parties to the conflict had conducted numerous mortar attacks against enemy forces in densely populated areas of Mogadishu without regard for the civilian population, causing a high loss of civilian life and property. While mortars could be highly accurate weapons if guided to their targets by spotters or guidance systems, none of the warring parties in Mogadishu had employed such methods. Opposition armed groups had indiscriminately fired mortar rounds in the general direction of Transitional Federal Government or AMISOM installations in southern Mogadishu. Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM forces sometimes responded in kind, directing mortar rounds towards the general area they had taken fire from or simply bombarding areas such as Bakara Market that were opposition strongholds. Such attacks, while of limited military value, caused considerable loss of civilian life and property damage.\n162. The report noted that there had been sporadic fighting between other groups outside Mogadishu which had exacted a heavy toll on civilians. For example, clashes between Hizbul Islam and Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca around the central towns of Dhusamareb and Beletweyne displaced more that 25,000 people at the beginning of 2010.\n163. The report further indicated that humanitarian workers had been targeted. According to the Office of the UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, 47 aid workers were killed in Somalia in 2008 and 2009. Humanitarian workers also faced a variety of other threats, from the broader trend of indiscriminate violence in conflict areas to al-Shabaab accusations of spying on behalf of western powers. For example, in early 2009 the WFP suspended delivery of food aid to a vast swath of southern Somalia controlled largely by al-Shabaab, citing the group\u2019s escalating attacks and harassment against its staff and \u201cunacceptable\u201d demands for payment.\n164. Forced and unlawful recruitment was also a problem. The report noted that opposition forces, especially but not exclusively al-Shabaab, were expanding their ranks by threatening those who resisted with death and at times carrying out their threats. In addition, both insurgent groups and government forces were recruiting and using child soldiers to varying degrees and had entered refugee camps in Kenya to enlist additional fighters. The report noted that al-Shabaab had recruited children in a more deliberate and systematic manner than the Transitional Federal Government or other armed groups. Thus the recruitment of children \u2013 and the fear of it \u2013 was widespread in many areas controlled by al-Shabaab.\n165. The report stated that in areas controlled by al-Shabaab (much of the south of Somalia), the population was subjected to targeted killings and assaults, a repressive form of social control and brutal punishments under its draconian interpretation of Sharia law, which went well beyond its traditional interpretation in Somalia. While in many areas al-Shabaab\u2019s rule had brought relative peace and order, security came at a steep price. In many areas, al-Shabaab dictated even minute details of daily life, from clothing styles to prayer observance to cell phone ring tones. The report indicated that:\n\u201cAl-Shabaab exerts enormous control over personal lives and devotes remarkable energy to policing and penalizing conduct that it deems idle or immoral. Almost no detail is too minute to escape the group\u2019s scrutiny. In many areas, al-Shabaab administrators have banned public gatherings, dancing at weddings, musical ringtones on cell phones, western music, and movies. They have outlawed qat chewing and cigarette smoking. They have barred men from shaving their beards and moustaches, or wearing long hair or long trousers. They have refused to allow people on the streets during prayer times.\nIn many areas, al-Shabaab patrols break up public gatherings, no matter how small, unless they are the organizers. Frequently, al-Shabaab justifies the dispersals on the grounds that participants are engaged in \u2018idle\u2019 or \u2018useless\u2019 activity, a concept that is arbitrarily applied and often includes everything from playing soccer to talking among friends. \u2018If they find a group of people talking, they may just beat them and tell them to go and do something useful\u2019, said one man from the border village of El Wak.\nOne young man from Kismayo said he watched an al-Shabaab patrol throw a group of teenage boys in jail one evening for playing Scrabble:\n\u2018They said this was idle activity. They took them away and jailed them overnight and shaved some of their heads with a razor blade or a broken bottle. One of them was injured from the shaving. They won\u2019t even let people gather to listen to the BBC, or to smoke tobacco.\u2019\u201d\n166. Human Rights Watch also interviewed a widower in an IDP camp in the Afgoye corridor, who claimed that al-Shabaab gunmen had threatened to kill him if he didn\u2019t stop tucking in his shirt, which they criticised as a western custom.\n167. Human Rights Watch noted that while all Somalis living under local al-Shabaab administrations had to cope with onerous and repressive edicts, women bore the brunt of the group\u2019s repression and abuse. In particular, some al-Shabaab leaders had ordered women to wear a particularly thick and bulky type of abaya, an over-gown which covered everything except the hands, face and feet. Al-Shabaab fighters would patrol neighbourhoods and punish women in lighter-weight abayas. In many cases women were beaten or whipped for wearing the wrong clothing.\n168. In addition, al-Shabaab administrations ordered women to close their shops as commercial activity permitted them to \u201cmix with men\u201d. In a country with a vast number of war widows and female-headed households, this edict left many families without crucial sources of income. Moreover, the segregation of men and women applied to all areas of daily life. Women were not permitted to go to the market with men, even if they were relatives, and if travelling in a vehicle, they had to sit in different seats. There were reports of women being flogged at checkpoints if they were found to be sitting beside a man.\n169. Finally, the report noted that in many areas, al-Shabaab leaders had embraced amputations and executions as punishment and turned them into a public spectacle. Since 2008 at least three people had been stoned to death for allegedly committing adultery. There were some unconfirmed reports that one of these people was a thirteen year old girl.\n##### 5. Human Rights Watch: World Report 2010\n170. Human Rights Watch Annual World Report summarised the situation in Somalia as \u201cone of the world\u2019s worst human rights catastrophes\u201d. Mogadishu was wracked by indiscriminate warfare in which all parties were implicated in war crimes or other serious human rights abuses, while much of the rest of the country was under the control of local administrations linked to armed opposition groups. In many of these areas the population had suffered from the abusive application of Sharia law and forced conscription of civilians, including children, as militia fighters. In addition, a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions was unfolding, fuelled by years of drought and insecurity that had often prevented the effective delivery of aid. Some 3.75 million people \u2013 roughly half of Somalia\u2019s remaining population \u2013 were in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. More than a million people were displaced from their homes within Somalia and tens of thousands had fled the country as refugees in 2009.\n171. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia had been severely hampered by the prevailing insecurity and by threats specifically targeting humanitarian agencies. Most of the humanitarian agencies operating in Somalia had had to dramatically curtail their operations or had been driven out of southern and central Somalia altogether. In\nopposition-controlled areas where millions of Somalis were in need of assistance, humanitarians had come under regular threat by al-Shabaab and other groups which accused them of colluding with international efforts to back the Transitional Federal Government.\n##### 6. Human Rights Watch \u2013 \u201cWelcome to Kenya\u201d: Police Abuse of Somali Refugees\n172. This report, which was published in June 2010, details the continuing abuses perpetrated by the Kenyan authorities against Somali refugees and asylum-seekers. It noted that despite the closure of the border, more than 140,000 refugees entered Kenya and registered at the Dadaab camps between 1 January 2007 and 30 April 2010. However, the closure of the border and UNHCR\u2019s transit centre had created a lawless no man\u2019s land in Kenya\u2019s border area near the refugee camps. Consequently, asylum-seekers endeavouring to reach the camps were often intercepted by Kenyan police who sought to extort money from them and unlawfully arrest, detain, abuse and even deport those who could not pay.\n173. Human Rights Watch spoke with dozens of Somali refugees whose vehicles had been stopped by police patrolling the border to extort money from them in exchange for free passage to the camps. In some cases, police had raped women and physically assaulted men. In many other cases, refugees were arrested and detained by the police before being permitted to register in the camps. They were detained in overcrowded cells with poor ventilation and no, or almost no, food and water. Some were not permitted to use the toilet and had to use the cell floor to urinate and defecate. Detained refugees were often released upon the payment of a bribe. If they could not pay, they were threatened with court proceedings in a last ditch attempt to extort money from them.\n174. Moreover, Human Rights Watch documented eight separate incidents in which Kenyan police returned asylum-seekers to Somalia. All of these incidents, which involved 152 men, women and children, took place between September 2009 and March 2010. According to this sample, Human Rights Watch estimated that hundreds if not thousands of Somalis were being returned to Somalia each month in breach of the principle of non-refoulement.\n175. Such widespread abuses compelled many asylum-seekers to travel through Kenya on smaller paths where criminals preyed on them, stealing their belongings and raping women.\n176. There were further reports of serious abuses by Kenyan police officers within the refugee camps. Seven refugees told Human Rights Watch of ten separate incidents during which police had violently assaulted them or during which they had observed police assaulting other refugees. One woman complained that she had been r", "001-91088": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF BOOTH v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n10. The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n11. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security benefit to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Wpt and WMA constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8 of the Convention.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1.

Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment\n##### 1. Admissibility\n12. The Court recalls that a widow was not automatically entitled to survivors\u2019 benefits, but had to claim them from the relevant authority. Various time-limits applied: after 1997, a widow had to make a claim for Wpt within three months of her husband\u2019s death.\n13. The Court considers, as it held in Cornwell v. the United Kingdom (no. 36578/97, (dec.), 11 May 1999) that unless or until a man has made a claim to the domestic authorities for bereavement benefits, he cannot be regarded as a \u201cvictim\u201d of the alleged discrimination involved in the refusal to pay such benefits, because a woman in the same position would not automatically be entitled to widows\u2019 benefits until she had made a claim (see also White v. the United Kingdom, no. 53134/99 (dec.), 7 June 2001, where the Court clarified that, as long as an applicant had made clear to the authorities his intention to claim benefits, the precise form in which he did so was not important). Similarly, a man who failed to apply within the time-limits as they applied to a woman claimant could not, in most cases, claim to be a victim of discrimination, since a woman in the same position would not have been entitled to the benefit in question (see Rogan v. the United Kingdom, no. 57946/00, (dec.), 8 September 2001).\n14. Consequently, the applicant\u2019s claim for Wpt made in 2000 had been made out of time. Thus, the applicant cannot claim to have been a victim of a violation of his rights under the Convention and Protocol No. 1.\n15. Accordingly, this part of the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and must be declared inadmissible in accordance with Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n16. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n17. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 41-43).\n18. The Court has examined the present case and finds that there are no facts or arguments from the Government which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WMA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Willis, cited above, \u00a7 42).\n19. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n20. The Court, having concluded that there has been a breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the applicant\u2019s non-entitlement to WMA, does not consider it necessary to examine his complaints in that regard under Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8.\n#### C.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 6 May and 16 September 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of other serious offences (e.g. manslaughter or rape) may also be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and it is not possible to say when that danger will subside.\n#### B. Tariffs\n13. Over the years, the Secretary of State has adopted a \u201ctariff\u201d policy in exercising his discretion whether to release offenders sentenced to life imprisonment. This was first publicly announced in Parliament by Mr Leon Brittan on 30 November 1983 (Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 505-507). In essence, the tariff approach involves breaking down the life sentence into component parts, namely retribution, deterrence and protection of the public. The \u201ctariff\u201d represents the minimum period which the prisoner will have to serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. The Secretary of State will not refer the case to the Parole Board until three years before the expiry of the tariff period, and will not exercise his discretion to release on licence until after the tariff period has been completed (per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, Ex parte V. and T., [1998] Appeal Cases 407, at pp. 492G-493A).\n14. Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After expiry of the tariff, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board which has the power to order release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary to detain him for the protection of the public.\n15. A different regime, however, applies under the 1991 Act to persons serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. In relation to these prisoners, the Secretary of State decides the length of the tariff. The view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial, as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State who then proceeds to fix the tariff and is entitled to depart from the judicial view (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531; and see the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard\u2019s, policy statement to Parliament, 27 July 1993, Hansard (House of Commons Debates) cols. 861-864).\n#### C. Release on licence of mandatory life sentence prisoners\n16. At the relevant time, the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provided in section 35(2):\n\u201cIf recommended to do so by the [Parole] Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.\u201d\n17. On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence, the Secretary of State\n\u201c... will consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice.\u201d\n18. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing the review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (\u201cthe tariff\u201d) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner\u2019s risk to the public following the expiry of the tariff (see e.g. R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 WLR 135; R. v. Parole Board ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 AER 576).\n#### D. Recent developments\n19. Following the judgment in Stafford v. the United Kingdom (no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002-IV), the Secretary of State announced in the House of Commons on 17 October 2002 his decision to introduce interim measures applicable to the review and release of mandatory life sentence prisoners applicable to reviews from 1 January 2003. This allows for prisoners, whose tariff had expired, to apply for an oral hearing at which they may have representation, receive full disclosure of material relevant to the question of release and be able to examine and cross-examine witness.\n\u201cIf, at the end of the review process, the Parole Board favours the release of a mandatory life sentence prisoner once the minimum period has been served the Home Secretary will normally accept such a recommendation. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n20.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 March 2004 and 11 July 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n14. The National Insurance Act 1946, which first established the basis for the national social security scheme in the United Kingdom, set out a system of funding under which all employers and the majority of the working population, whether employed or self-employed, are liable to pay compulsory NICs contributions. This legislation has since been replaced, most recently, by the consolidating provisions of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (\u201cSSCBA 1992\u201d) and the Social Security Administration Act 1992.\n15. Section 1(2) of the SSCBA 1992 sets out the various classes of NIC. Of these, the largest category is Class 1 contributions which consist of earnings-related contributions paid by employers and employees. Such contributions are levied as a percentage of earnings which varies according to the employee\u2019s earnings band. The NIC scheme is financed on a \u201cpay as you go\u201d basis, that is, current NICs fund current benefits: thus an individual\u2019s contributions fund not his or her own benefits but those of others (R. (Carson) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2002] 3 All ER paragraphs 25-26).\n16. A substantial contribution has been made to the National Health Service from NICs for many years. Following the National Insurance Act 2002, which imposed an additional deduction of 1% of earnings above the upper earnings limits, the element of calculation of the NHS allocation was also increased from 1.05% of earnings paid in the tax year to 2.05%.\n17. Section 6(2) of the Act provides that only those under the state pension age are liable to pay NICs from their earnings. The state pension ages are currently set as 65 for men and 60 for women according to section 122.\n18. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of state pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The state pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay NICs will gradually increase in line with the increase in the state pension age.\n### III. EUROPEAN UNION LAW\n19. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of \u201cthe determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits\u201d.\n20. In the Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR1-4297 (\u201cthe EOC case\u201d concerning reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that:\n\u2022 Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference;\n\u2022 Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age;\n\u2022 In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively. (Summary of judgment)\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n21. The applicant, aged over 60, complained that he was required to pay NICs whereas a woman of the same age who was working would not. The relevant provisions of the Convention provide:\n22. Article 14 of the Convention:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n23. The applicant submitted that it was in violation of Article 14 of the Convention that he was required to pay NICs from his earnings while a 60 year old woman who was working would not have to pay such contributions. These contributions now included an extra 1% added under the National Insurance Act 2002, the proceeds of which were included within the National Health Service allocation. He disputed that there was any direct or necessary link between the age of entitlement to the basic state pension (60 for women, 65 for men) and liability to pay NICs. Employers had to pay for female employees regardless of their ages and it was open to women to defer their state pension after the age of 60 and to continue to make contributions to enhance their contribution record.\n24. The applicant submitted that \u201cvery weighty reasons\u201d had to be provided to justify sex discrimination and that the more lenient test under Article 1 of Protocol 1, whereby only measures \u201cmanifestly without reasonable foundation\u201d were challengeable, did not apply in such cases. There was no reason why he should have to pay towards the NHS for a longer period than women, which obligation had no objective connection with the state pension age. The recent increase in deductions from the NI Fund for NHS funding purposes was manipulating NICs as a general taxation source which aggravated the existing inequality. As the NI Fund was not in fact self-financing but could be topped up by money from general taxation, it could not be said that changes in contributions would prejudice the equilibrium of the scheme. If women were required to pay, it would in fact boost the amount of funds. Any differences in entitlement were a consequence only of the way in which the Government had chosen to structure the benefit system.\n25. The applicant submitted that the Grand Chamber\u2019s judgment in Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 65731/01 and 65900/01, 12 April 2006) did not decide the issues in his case, as he was primarily complaining of the discrimination, not in the differential eligibility ages for the state pension, but in the differential contribution periods for NICs, a substantial part of which did not go towards funding benefits but was in effect a form of taxation that went to fund the NHS. Even if the Government could justify discrimination in relation to contributions to the social security system, there was no inextricable link between the funding of the NHS and the actual, or notional, working life of an individual. In particular there was no good reason why men between 60 and 64 should contribute to the NHS but that women of the age were exempt. While there was a factual link of sorts between work and contributions, they pointed out that individuals not in work, or who had caring responsibilities could also pay or be credited with contributions. He also pointed out that employers continued to pay NICs on behalf of employees regardless of whether they had reached the state pension age. Finally, he argued that the ECJ in the various rulings on benefits and contributions had not addressed the issues in the case.\n##### 2. The Government\n26. The Government accepted that Article 14 in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was applicable to any discrimination in the obligation to make NICs. They claimed that it was not possible to dissociate the obligation on working males between 60 and 65 to pay NICs from the different state retirement ages for men and women. The level and duration of NI contributions were necessarily linked to the assumed working life and thus the fixed state retirement age for men. While women aged 60-65 were able to defer their state pensions and continue to work without paying NICs, men aged 65-70 also had that possibility. It was not correct that women could elect to pay contributions, save in respect of voluntary Class 3 contributions for those years before the tax year when the woman reached the age of 60.\n27. The Government disputed that the NICs paid by any individual could be analysed as being in substance two separate contributions, one to the NHS and the other to the NI Fund. The payments were dissociable, as allocations were made at an aggregate level on the basis of forecasts made by the Inland Revenue. If the obligation to pay NICs was discriminatory as a whole, this fell within the scope of Article 7(1)a of the Directive 79/7/EEC (see paragraph 18 above), the purpose and content of which justified any difference in treatment. Even assuming the NICs were two separate contributions, they were capable of separate justification as being in the proportionate pursuit of legitimate aims.\n28. The Government pointed out, that along with other EC and Contracting States, they were in the process of phasing out differing pensionable ages for men and women and whilst doing so were protected as a matter of EC law. By phasing out differential treatment in a measured and controlled fashion that maintained the financial equilibrium of the social security system and protected the expectations of older women who had planned to retire and receive their state pension at age 60, the Government submitted that they were acting in an objectively justified and proportionate manner.

The applicant complained that British social security legislation discriminated against him on grounds of sex, in breach of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with both Article 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nTHE LAW\n9. By a letter of 11 May 2005 the respondent Government informed the Court that the House of Lords had decided, in relation to the claims for Widowed Mother's Allowance (WMA) and Widow's Payment (WPt), that there was in principle no objective justification at the relevant time for not paying these benefits to widowers as well as widows, but that the Government had a defence under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA). It noted that, in view of this, the multitude of cases before the Court and the fact that the HRA defence was only applicable in the domestic arena, the Government were prepared, in principle, to settle all claims made by widowers against the United Kingdom arising out of the arrangements applicable prior to April 2001 for the payment of WMA and WPt.\n10. On 23 April 2007 the applicant's representative notified the Court that Mr Arkwell had been offered GBP 18,195.71 in respect of his claim for WPt and/or WMA and that he had accepted payment. The applicant's representative further requested the Court to adjourn the claim for Widow's Pension. On 30 April 2007 the applicant's representative was sent a letter by the Registry stating that the Court would consider striking the case out of its list in respect of the claim which has been settled, while the claim in respect of Widow's Pension would be adjourned until the Court's lead judgment on that issue, Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom (nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99), delivered on 10 May 2007, had become final (see paragraph 13 below).

The relevant domestic law and practice are described in the Court\u2019s judgments in the cases of Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, \u00a7\u00a7 14\u201126, ECHR 2002-IV; Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, 26 March 2007; and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom nos. 42949/98 and 53134/99, 25 July 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 AND/OR ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION.\n13. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities\u2019 refusal to pay him the social security and tax benefits to which he would have been entitled had he been a woman in a similar position, namely Widow\u2019s Payment (\u201cWpt\u201d), Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance (\u201cWMA\u201d), Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance (\u201cWBA\u201d) and Widow\u2019s Pension (\u201cWP\u201d) constituted discrimination against him on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and/or Article 8.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1. Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\nArticle 8 of the Convention provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life...\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ... the economic well-being of the country...\u201d\n#### A. Widow\u2019s Payment and/or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n14. By a letter of 12 May 2006 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr O\u2019Brien had been offered GBP 12,393.23 in respect of his claims for Wpt and/or WMA including costs and that he had accepted the offer. By a letter of 16 May 2007 the applicant\u2019s representatives notified the Court that Mr O\u2019Brien had received the said payment.\n15. The Court takes note of the friendly settlement reached between the parties in respect of Wpt and/or WMA. It is satisfied that the settlement is based on respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and its Protocols (Article 37 \u00a7 1 in fine of the Convention and Rule 62 \u00a7 3 of the Rules of Court).\n16. Consequently, this part of the application should be struck out of the list.\n#### B. Widow\u2019s Bereavement Allowance\n##### 1. Admissibility\n17. The Government contested the admissibility of the applicant\u2019s claim for the tax year 1999/2000 on the basis that he had only made an oral claim, therefore failing to comply with a domestic requirement. According to domestic legal provisions, telephone claims could be accepted from 1998 onwards, but only if they related to the current year of assessment, namely, the year of assessment in which the claim was made, or the following year. In the present case Mr O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim for the tax year 1999/2000 referred to a previous year of assessment. Consequently, the applicant cannot claim to be a victim of the alleged violation.\n18. The applicant submitted that the Court should not differ from its holding in White v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no.53134/99) in which it rejected the Government\u2019s plea regarding benefit claims not made in the proper format. Indeed there were no reasons why claims for WBA could not be treated on a par with claims for other bereavement benefits.\n19. The Court recalls that the precise form in which an applicant indicates his intention to claim benefits is not of importance, the central question being whether the applicant has made clear his wish to claim benefits (see White, cited above). The Court finds that in the present case the applicant made clear such intention for both years of assessment, whether in writing or orally, and he can accordingly claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention for the purposes of Article 34.\n20. The Court finds that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, or inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n##### 2. Merits\n21. The Court has previously ex", "001-83404": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF CRILLY v.

The relevant domestic law and practice is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n8. The applicant complained that the United Kingdom authorities' refusal to grant him WBA or equivalent constituted discrimination on grounds of sex contrary to Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\nArticle 14 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 provides:\n\u201c1.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n9. The Court has previously examined cases raising issues similar to those in the present case and found a violation of Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (Hobbs, Richard, Walsh and Geen v. the United Kingdom, nos. 63684/00, 63475/00, 63484/00 and 63468/00, judgment of 26 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54).\n10. The Court has examined the present case and finds that the Government have not presented any facts or arguments which would lead to any different conclusion in this instance. Therefore the Court considers that the difference in treatment between men and women as regards entitlement to WBA, of which the applicant was a victim, was not based on any \u201cobjective and reasonable justification\u201d (see Hobbs, cited above, \u00a7 53).\n11.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 December 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) came into force on 1 April 1997 and amended the disciplinary and court-martial procedures regulated by the Naval Discipline Act 1957, the Army Act 1955 and the Air Force Act 1955. References below to \u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d are to the Army Act 1955 as amended. The statutory disciplinary provisions applicable to armed forces personnel are contained in the above-listed three \u201cservice discipline Acts\u201d. Each Act specifies, in virtually identical terms, the offences for which persons subject to that Act can be tried and the punishments applicable. Persons subject to armed forces law are thereby subjected to a common code of offences and punishments.\n#### A. The Offence\n20. The offences triable under the 1955 Act include misconduct in action; offences by or in relation to sentries, person on watch etc; failure to attend for, neglect of, duty; looting; mutiny and related offences; insubordinate behaviour; disobedience of a lawful command or standing order; desertion, absence without leave and related offences; malingering, drunkenness, disorderly conduct and fighting; refusal to submit to drug testing; false statements on entry or enlistment; offences harmful to morale; scandalous or disgraceful behaviour; ill-treatment of persons of inferior rank and conduct or neglect to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (see sections 24-68 of the 1955 Act).\n21. In addition to the above, any person subject to armed forces law who commits a civilian offence (any act punishable by the laws of England) is also guilty of an offence against the service discipline Acts (section 70 of the 1955 Act).\n22. Section 33(1)(b) of the Army Act 1955 (\u201cthe 1955 Act\u201d) provides:\n\u201cAny person subject to military law who - ...\n(b) uses threatening or insubordinate language to his superior officer\nshall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to imprisonment or any less punishment provided by this Act.\u201d\n#### B. Summary trial: investigations\n23. Section 76 of the 1955 Act provides that an allegation that an accused has committed an offence, including the offence cited above, shall be reported to his commanding officer (\u201cCO\u201d). Regulation 25 of the Investigation and Summary Dealing (Army) Regulations 1997 (\u201cthe 1997 Regulations\u201d - enacted under section 83 of the 1955 Act) provides that COs shall investigate the charge by, inter alia, causing such enquiries to be made as appear necessary. Following investigation, the CO may dismiss the charge, refer the charge to a higher authority or deal with it summarily.\n#### C. Summary trial: hearings\n24. Regulation 9 of the 1997 Regulations notes that COs may deal summarily with any charge under section 33 of the 1955 Act. Before dealing summarily with a charge, a CO shall, inter alia, call witnesses whose evidence he considers may be relevant to the charge, allow the accused to question those witnesses, allow the accused to give evidence on his own behalf and allow the accused to call his own witnesses (Regulation 29 of the 1997 Regulations). The CO had to either hear evidence orally himself or cause it to be reduced to writing. The latter was obligatory if it was considered that extended detention could be awarded on any finding of guilt (see \u201cPenalties\u201d at paragraph 28 below).\n25. If, having heard the evidence, the CO finds that the charge has been proved, the CO shall, before so recording, afford the accused the opportunity of electing trial by court-martial (Section 76B of the 1955 Act). If the accused does not so elect, the CO can, inter alia, record a finding of guilty and award penalties.\n26. While an accused cannot be legally represented at the CO hearing, Chapter 62 of the Army General Administrative Instructions (\u201cAGAIs\u201d) describes the Accused\u2019s Adviser procedure. The Adviser acts in the accused\u2019s best interests but is not to be considered a form of defence lawyer and is not legally qualified. An Adviser\u2019s function is limited to advising the accused before and at the hearing (for example, as regards whether to elect trial by court-martial) and making a statement during the trial about the accused\u2019s background and in mitigation. Detailed guidance for the Accused\u2019 Adviser is set out at Annex M to Chapter 62, including on the procedure for electing trial by court-martial and the advice to be given to an accused in that respect.\n#### D. Penalties\n27. The maximum duration of the imprisonment for the offence of using insubordinate language is not defined under the 1955 Act.\n28. By virtue of Regulation 12 of the 1997 Regulations, a CO dealing summarily with an offence can make an award of detention not exceeding 28 days unless he complies with Regulation 31 of the 1997 Regulations. That Regulation provides that a CO may award extended detention (up to 60 days) if he has taken written statements from all the witnesses (Regulation 31(3)), satisfied himself that the accused was not likely to dispute the charge (Regulation 31(4)), obtained permission from a higher authority to award extended detention (Regulation 31(5) and (7)) and informed the accused of his extended powers (Regulation 31(9)).\n29. A district court-martial can award imprisonment of up to two years (section 85(2) of the 1955 Act). There is no upward limit on the awards of imprisonment of a general court-martial.\n#### E. The Pamphlet\n30. All soldiers are provided with a pamphlet entitled \u201cThe Rights of a Soldier Charged with an Offence under the Army Act 1955\u201d. The pamphlet was amended on 1 October 1997 following the entry into force of the 1996 Act.\n31. The post-October 1997 version of the pamphlet submitted by the Government in the present case informs soldiers of their right to have an Accused\u2019s Adviser both before and during the hearing, of the role of the Adviser (see paragraph 26 above), the procedure at the hearing, the penalties available, the procedure for applying for extended detention powers, the means of electing for trial by court-martial (including when and how much time is accorded to decide), the time available to withdraw any such election and the consequences of such an election (including the possibility of being prosecuted on more serious charges).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant made various complaints under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention, which provisions, in so far as relevant, read as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ....\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n...\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6\n33. The applicant contended that the charges against him were \u201ccriminal\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 having regard to the three criteria outlined at paragraph 82 of the Engel judgment (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22). While he accepted that the relevant offence was disciplinary in domestic law and in nature, he argued that the penalty risked rendered it criminal. The maximum penalty risked by him was life imprisonment (if he was tried by general court-martial), two years\u2019 imprisonment (if tried by a district court-martial) or 60 days\u2019 imprisonment (the extended sentencing powers of a CO).\n34. Prior to admissibility, the Government noted that the offence was disciplinary in domestic law and in nature and considered that neither the penalty risked nor that awarded was sufficiently severe as to \u201ctransform\u201d a disciplinary offence into a criminal one. Following admissibility, the Government did not comment on the applicability of Article 6.\n35. The Court notes that it remains undisputed that the starting-point, for the assessment of the applicability of the criminal aspect of Article 6 of the Convention to the present proceedings, is the criteria outlined at paragraph 82 of the above-cited Engel judgment:\n\u201c...[I]t is first necessary to know whether the provision(s) defining the offence charged belong, according to the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law, disciplinary law or both concurrently. This however provides no more than a starting point. The indications so afforded have only a formal and relative value and must be examined in the light of the common denominator of the respective legislation of the various Contracting States.\nThe very nature of the offence is a factor of greater import. ...\nHowever, supervision by the Court does not stop there. Such supervision would generally prove to be illusory if it did not also take into consideration the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring.\u201d\n36. In its more recent judgment in the case of Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom ([GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003\u2011X), the Court clarified as follows:\n86. In addition, it is the Court\u2019s established jurisprudence that the second and third criteria laid down in Engel are alternative and not necessarily cumulative: for Article 6 to be held applicable, it suffices that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as \u201ccriminal\u201d from the point of view of the Convention, or that the offence made the person liable to a sanction which, by its nature and degree of severity, belongs in general to the \u201ccriminal\u201d sphere .... This does not exclude that a cumulative approach may be adopted where separate analysis of each criterion does not make it possible to reach a clear conclusion as to the existence of a criminal charge ...\n...\n120. The nature and severity of the penalty which was \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d on the applicants ... are determined by reference to the maximum potential penalty for which the relevant law provides ...\nThe actual penalty imposed is relevant to the determination ... but it cannot diminish the importance of what was initially at stake (see Engel and Others, cited above, p. 36, \u00a7 85, together with Demicoli, Garyfallou AEBE and Weber, loc. cit.).\u201d\n37. In its Ezeh and Connors judgment, the Court referred specifically to the following extract from paragraph 82 of the Engel judgment:\n\u201cIn a society subscribing to the rule of law, there belong to the \u2018criminal\u2019 sphere deprivations of liberty liable to be imposed as a punishment, except those which by their nature, duration or manner of execution cannot be appreciably detrimental. The seriousness of what is at stake, the traditions of the Contracting States and the importance attached by the Convention to respect for the physical liberty of the person all require that this should be so.\u201d\nand went on to conclude (at paragraph 126) that:\n\u201cAccordingly, given the deprivations of liberty liable to be and actually imposed on the present applicants, there is a presumption that the charges against them were criminal within the meaning of Article 6, a presumption which could be rebutted entirely exceptionally, and only if those deprivations of liberty could not be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given their nature, duration or manner of execution.\u201d\n38. The offence at issue in the present case (using insubordinate language to a superior officer) was, in the Court\u2019s view, disciplinary in domestic law and in nature. It was one of the service disciplinary offences listed in the 1955 Act (see paragraphs 19-22 above) to be prosecuted by the services only. Its aim was to maintain discipline within the armed forces and there was no apparent civilian criminal equivalent (Campbell and Fell v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 June 1984, Series A no. 80, \u00a7 71).\n39. However, the Engel criteria being alternative and not necessarily cumulative, the \u201ccriminal\u201d nature of the relevant \u201coffence\u201d could, in principle, be determined solely on the basis of the nature and severity of the sanction.\n40. It was not disputed, and the Court finds, that the applicant\u2019s confinement in a locked battalion guardroom amounted to a deprivation of liberty (the above-cited Engel judgment, at \u00a7 63 and Stephen Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 30280/96, \u00a7 25, 14 March 2000). Since a deprivation of liberty was liable to be and was actually imposed on the applicant, there was a presumption that the charge against him was \u201ccriminal\u201d, a presumption which could be rebutted entirely exceptionally and only if his deprivation of liberty could not be considered \u201cappreciably detrimental\u201d given its nature, duration or manner of execution (the above-cited Ezeh and Connors judgment, at \u00a7 126).\n41. The parties disagreed on the severity of the penalty \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d: the Government argued that it was 28 days and the applicant maintained that it was either life imprisonment, two years or sixty days for the reasons outlined above. However, the applicant did not select trial by court-martial and the CO did not take any of the steps required by Regulation 31 (and listed at paragraph 28 above) in order to obtain extended detention powers in the applicant\u2019s case. Consequently, the sentence \u201cliable to be imposed\u201d was the maximum penalty of 28 days which was available at the moment of the applicant\u2019s summary trial before the CO (Engel, at \u00a7\u00a7 24 and 85), this period being the equivalent of an eight-week sentence in a domestic criminal court. The actual sentence imposed was 7 days\u2019 detention.\n42. The Court concludes that the deprivation of liberty which was liable to be, and which actually was, imposed on the applicant cannot be regarded as sufficiently unimportant or inconsequential as to displace t", "001-61080": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF APPLEBY AND OTHERS v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 April 2003,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n22. At common law, a private property owner may, in certain circumstances, be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes. This is the case with commercial premises, such as shops, theatres and restaurants, as well as private premises (for example, there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing). Any implied invitation may be revoked at will. A private person\u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness.\n23. In CIN Properties Ltd v. Rawlins ([1995] 2 EGLR (Estates Gazette Law Reports) 130), where the applicants (young men) were barred from a shopping centre in Wellingborough as the private company owner CIN considered that their behaviour was a nuisance, the Court of Appeal held that CIN had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre. In giving judgment, Lord Phillips found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section 18(1) of the Highways Act 1971 (later replaced by section 35 of the Highways Act 1980) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by-laws regulating the use of those rights of way. Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence. He also considered case-law from North America concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right:\n\u201cOf more obvious relevance are two North American cases. In Uston v. Resorts International Inc. (1982) N.J. 445A.2d 370, the Supreme Court of New Jersey laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their premises \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests, they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but, on the contrary, have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their premises. However, that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in State v. Schmid (1980) N.J. 423A 2d 615, which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of the First Amendment. The general proposition cited above has no application in English law.\nThe case of Harrison v. Carswell (1975) 62 D.L.R. 3d 68 in the Supreme Court of Canada concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre, against the wishes of the owner of the centre. The majority of the Supreme Court held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. However, Laskin C.J.C., in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public, the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner\u2019s whim. He said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and \u2013\n\u2019If it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.\u2019\nI have already said that this was a dissenting judgment. Nevertheless counsel [for the applicants] submitted that we should apply it in the present case. I accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary. However there is no such necessity where Parliament has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by section 18 of the Highways Act 1971 and section 35 of the Highways Act 1980. (Harrison v. Carswell makes no mention of any similar legislation in Canada.) Where Parliament has legislated and the Council, as representing the public, chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides, it is not for the courts to intervene.\nI would allow this appeal ... on the basis that CIN had the right, subject only to the issue under section 20 of the Race Relations Act 1976, to determine any licence the [applicants] may have had to enter the Centre.\u201d\n### III. CASES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS\n24. The parties have referred to case-law from the United States and Canada.\n#### A. The United States\n25. The First Amendment to the Federal Constitution protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.\n26. The United States Supreme Court has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places, such as streets and parks, known as \u201cpublic fora\u201d for the exercise of free speech (Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organisation, 307 U.S. (United States: Supreme Court Reports) 496 (1939)). In Marsh v. Alabama (326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. (Supreme Court Reporter) 276, 90 L.Ed. (United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers\u2019 Edition) 265 (1946)), the Supreme Court also held that a privately owned corporate town (a company town) having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the First Amendment rights of free speech and peaceable assembly. It has found that the First Amendment does not require access to privately owned properties, such as shopping centres, on the basis that there has to be \u201cState action\u201d (a degree of State involvement) for the amendment to apply (see, for example, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976)).\n27. The United States Supreme Court has taken the position that the First Amendment does not prevent a private shopping-centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its premises of leaflets unrelated to its own operations (Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 47 U.S. 551, 92 S.Ct. 2219, 33 L.Ed. 2d 131 (1972)). This did not however prevent State constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than the Federal Constitution to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping-centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions (Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robbins, 447 U.S. 74, 64 L.Ed. 2d 741, 100 S.Ct. 2035 (1980)).\n28. Some State courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their State constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures (see, for example, Batchelder v. Allied Stores Int\u2019l, N.E. (West\u2019s North Eastern Reporter) 2d 590 (Massachussetts, 1983); Lloyd Corp. v. Whiffen, 849 P. (West\u2019s Pacific Reporter) 2d 446, 453-54 (Oregon, 1993); Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., 780 P. 2d 1282 (Washington, 1989)). Some cases found State obligations arising due to State involvement, for example, Bock v. Westminster Mall Co., 819 P. 2d 55 (Colorado, 1991) (the shopping centre was a State actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas), and Jamestown v. Beneda, 477 N.W. (West\u2019s North Western Reporter) 2d 830 (North Dakota, 1991) (where the shopping centre was owned by a public body, although leased to a private developer).\n29. Other cases cited as indicating a right to reasonable access to property under State private law were State v. Shack, 277 A. (West\u2019s Atlantic Reporter) 2d 369 (New Jersey, 1971), where the court ruled that under New Jersey property law ownership of real property did not include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers, in this case a publicly funded non-profit lawyer attempting to advise migrant workers; Uston v. Resorts International, 445 A. 2d 370 (New Jersey, 1982), a New Jersey case concerning casinos where the court held that when property owners open their premises to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably (although it was acknowledged that the private law of most States did not require a right of reasonable access to privately owned property, p. 374); and Streetwatch v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., 875 F. Supp. (West\u2019s Federal Supplement) 1055 (Southern District of New York, 1995) concerning the ejection of homeless people from a railway station.\n30. States in which courts ruled that free speech provisions in their constitutions did not apply to privately owned shopping centres included Arizona (Fiesta Mall Venture v. Mecham Recall Comm., 767 P. 2d 719 (Court of Appeals, 1989)); Connecticut (Cologne v. Westfarms Assocs, 469 A. 2d 1201 (1984)); Georgia (Citizens for Ethical Gov\u2019t v. Gwinnet Place Assoc., 392 S.E. (West\u2019s South Eastern Reporter) 2d 8 (1990)); Michigan (Woodland v. Michigan Citizens Lobby, 378 N.W. 2d 337 (1985)); Minnesota (State of Minnesota v. Wicklund et al., 7 April 1998 (Court of Appeals)); North Carolina (State of North Carolina v. Felmet, 273 S.E. 2d 708 (1981)); Ohio (Eastwood Mall v. Slanco, 626 N.E. 2d 59 (1994)); Pennsylvania (Western Pa Socialist Workers 1982 Campaign v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 515 A. 2d 1331 (1986)); South Carolina (Charleston Joint Venture v. McPherson, 417 S.E. 2d 544 (1992)); Washington (Southcenter Joint Venture v. National Democratic Policy Comm., cited above; and Wisconsin (Jacobs v. Major, 407 N.W. 2d 832 (1987)).\n#### B. Canada\n31. Prior to the entry into force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Supreme Court had taken the view that the owner of a shopping centre could exclude protesters (Harrison v. Carswell, 62 D.L.R. (Dominion Law Reports) 3d 68 (1975)). After the Charter entered into force, a lower court held that the right to free speech applied in privately owned shopping centres (R. v. Layton, 38 C.C.C. (Canadian Criminal Cases) 3d 550 (1986) (Provincial Court, Judicial District of York, Ontario)). However, an individual judge of the Canadian Supreme Court has since expressed the opposite view, stating obiter that the Charter does not confer a right to use private property as a forum of expression (McLachlin J, Committee for Cth of Can. v. Canada [1991] 1 SCR (Canada Supreme Court Reports) 139, 228).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n32. Article 10 of the Convention provides:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicants\n33. The applicants submitted that the State was directly responsible for the interference with their freedom of expression and assembly as it was a public entity that had built the Galleries on public land and a minister who had approved the transfer into private ownership. The local authority could have required that the purchaser enter into a walkways agreement, which would have extended by-law protection to access ways, but did not do so.\n34. The applicants also argued that the State owed a positive obligation to secure the exercise of their rights within the Galleries. As the information and ideas which they wished to communicate were of a political nature, their expression was entitled to the greatest level of protection. Access to the town centre was essential for the exercise of those rights as it was the most effective way of communicating their ideas to the population, as was shown by the fact that the local authority itself used the Galleries to promote a political proposal regarding the reorganisation of local government. Yet, the applicants had been refused permission to use the Galleries to express their opposition to local government action, showing that the private owner was not neutral in its decisions as to who should be given permission. The finding of an obligation would impose no significant financial burden on the State as it was merely under a duty to put in place a legal framework which provided effective protection for their rights of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly by balancing those rights against the rights of the property owner, as already existed in a number of areas. They considered that no proper balance had been struck as protection was afforded to property owners, who wielded an absolute discretion as to who should have access to their land, while no regard was given to individuals seeking to exercise their individual rights.\n35. The applicants submitted that it was for the State to decide how to remedy this shortcoming and that any purported definitional problems and difficulties of application could be resolved by carefully drafted legislation. A definition of \u201cquasi-public\u201d land could be proposed that excluded, for example, theatres. They also referred to case-law from other jurisdictions (in particular the United States) where concepts of reasonable access or limitations on arbitrary exclusion powers of landowners were being developed, inter alia, in the context of shopping malls and university campuses, which gave an indication of how the State could approach the perceived problems.\n##### 2. The Government\n36. The Government submitted that at the relevant time the town centre was owned by a private company, Postel, and that it was Postel, in the exercise of its rights as property owner, which refused the applicants permission to use the Galleries for their activities. They argued that, in those circumstances, the State could not be regarded as bearing direct responsibility for any interference with the applicants\u2019 exercise of their rights. The fact that the land had previously been owned by the local authority was irrelevant.\n37. In so far as the applicants claimed that the State\u2019s positive obligation to secure their rights was engaged, the Government acknowledged that positive obligations were capable of arising under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. However, such obligations did not arise in the present case, having regard to a number of factors. The alleged breach did not have a serious impact on the applicants, who had many other opportunities of exercising their rights and used them to obtain thousands of signatures on their petition as a result. The burden imposed on the State by the finding of a positive obligation would also be a heavy one. When selling land, local authorities were not under any duty to enter into walkways agreements to render access areas subject to by-law regulation. The State\u2019s ability to comply with such an obligation by entering into that type of agreement when selling State-owned land would depend entirely on obtaining the cooperation of the private-sector purchaser, who might reasonably not want to allow any form of canvassing on his land and might feel that customers of commercial services would be deterred by the presence of political canvassers, religious activists, animal rights campaigners, etc.\n38. Furthermore, a fair balance had been struck between the competing interests in this case. The applicants, in the Government\u2019s view only looked at one side of the balancing exercise, whereas legitimate objections could be raised by property owners if they were required to allow people to exercise their freedom of expression or assembly on their land, w", "001-60649": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF BENJAMIN and WILSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 28212/95)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n26 September 2002\nFINAL\n26/12/2002\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Benjamin and Wilson v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr I. Cabral Barreto, President,\nMr L. Caflisch,\nMr R. T\u00fcrmen,\nMr B. Zupan\u010di\u010d,\nMrs H.S. Greve,\nMr K. Traja, judges,\nSir Scott Baker, ad hoc judge,\nand Mr V. Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 5 September 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Transfer and restriction directions on prisoners under the Mental Health Act 1983\n19. Under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (\u201cthe 1983 Act\u201d), the Secretary of State may transfer a person serving a sentence of imprisonment to hospital if he is satisfied that the person is suffering from mental illness, psychopathic disorder, severe mental impairment or mental impairment, and that the mental disorder is of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, and, in the case of psychopathic disorder or mental impairment, that such treatment is likely to alleviate or prevent a deterioration of the condition. A transfer under section 47 of the 1983 Act is called a \u201ctransfer direction\u201d, and has the same effect as if a hospital order had been made under section 37 (1) of the 1983 Act (that is, where a court convicts a person and, instead of sentencing him, orders his detention in hospital).\n20. At the same time as making a transfer direction, the Secretary of State may also make a \u201crestriction direction\u201d under section 49 of the 1983 Act. A restriction direction has the same effect as a restriction order made by a court under section 41 of the 1983 Act on conviction, save that because the person was not given a hospital order by the court, the Secretary of State must consent to his discharge from hospital, as well as to the granting of leave of absence or transfer to another hospital.\n21. A transferred life prisoner subject to restriction directions can be discharged from hospital in three possible ways. Each can be initiated only by the Secretary of State.\n(1) Section 42 (2) of the 1983 Act gives the Secretary of State power, if he thinks fit, by warrant to discharge the patient either absolutely or subject to conditions.\n(2) Section 50 of the 1983 Act provides that where the Secretary of State is notified by the responsible medical officer, and other registered practitioner or a Mental Health Review Tribunal that the person no longer requires treatment in hospital for mental disorder, or that no effective treatment for the disorder can be given in the hospital, the Secretary of State may remit the person to a prison or to a different institution, or he may exercise any power of releasing or discharging him which would have been exercisable if he had been so remitted.\n(3) Under Section 74 of the 1983 Act,\n\u201c(1) Where an application to a Mental Health Review Tribunal is made by a restricted patient who is subject to a restriction direction, or where the case of such a patient is referred to such a tribunal, the tribunal -\n(a) shall notify the Secretary of State whether, in their opinion, the patient would, if subject to a restriction order, be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged under Section 73 ...; and\n(b) if they notify him that the patient would be entitled to be conditionally discharged, may recommend that in the event of his not being discharged under this section he should continue to be detained in hospital.\n(2) If in the case of a patient not falling within subsection (4) below-\n(a) the tribunal notify the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged; and\n(b) within the period of 90 days beginning with the date of that notification the Secretary of State gives notice to the tribunal that the patient may be so discharged,\nthe tribunal shall direct the absolute or, as the case may be, the conditional discharge of the patient.\n...\n(4) If, in the case of a patient who is subject to a transfer direction under Section 48 above, the tribunal notify the Secretary of State that the patient would be entitled to be absolutely or conditionally discharged, the Secretary of State shall, unless the tribunal have made a recommendation under subsection (1)(b) above, by warrant direct that the patient be remitted to a prison or other institution in which he might have been detained if he had not been removed to hospital, there to be dealt with as if he had not been so removed.\u201d\n22. Section 73 of the 1983 Act (which relates to restricted patients under section 41 of the 1983 Act) provides that the tribunal must direct conditional discharge if they are satisfied that he is not suffering from mental illness or disorder of a type which makes it appropriate for the person to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment, or that it is not necessary for the health or safety of the patient or for the protection of other persons that he should receive such treatment, and they believe that it is appropriate for the patient to remain liable to be recalled to hospital for further treatment.\n23. In 1985, the Home Secretary announced that life sentence prisoners who had been transferred to hospital would normally be discharged under section 50 of the 1983 Act rather than sections 42 (2) or 74 (2). This enables release on life licence with life-long control rather than the possibility of eventual absolute discharge by the Secretary of State. The policy was found to be lawful in the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Stroud (16 July 1992).\n#### B. Discretionary life prisoners\n24. Section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides that where a discretionary life prisoner has served his tariff (that is, the \u201cpunishment\u201d part of his sentence), and the Parole Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he should be detained and has directed his release, it is the duty of the Secretary of State to release him. Under Paragraph 9 of Schedule 12, which is a transitional provision to the 1991 Act, the Secretary of State can apply the provisions of section 34 to discretionary life prisoners who were sentenced before section 34 of the 1991 Act came into force on 10 October 1992 by issuing a certificate that, if the 1991 Act had been in force when the person was sentenced, section 34 would have been applied.\n#### C.

Fischbach,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nMr R. Maruste,\nMr L. Garlicki, judges,\nand Mr M. O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Disability benefits\n23. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board\u2019s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK).\n#### B. Procedure\n24. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court.\n25. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.\n26. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n27. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n28. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court had constituted a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n29. The Government claimed that it had been justified to dispense with an oral hearing in the applicant\u2019s case. They contended that a hearing would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case file and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they submitted that the case had concerned purely medical issues or issues closely related to such issues. They pointed out that the applicant wished to be heard in person before the Administrative Court of Appeal about his working conditions and the costs of his consumption of fluids. However, he had been on early retirement since 1989. Furthermore, all the relevant evidence in the case had been in writing. The judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s need of fluids due to his handicap by meeting him in person but had had to rely on the written medical evidence submitted in the case. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing his case in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under a social-insurance scheme, no questions of public interest had been involved.\n30. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold an oral hearing and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing, he had, at least tacitly, waived his right to have his case heard in public before that judicial instance.\n##### 2. The applicant\n31. The applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. He stated that the case had not concerned purely medical issues but had rather concerned the amount of the applicant\u2019s extra costs. This amount could not be derived from the opinions given in the medical certificates. Rather, the applicant had been the only one to give that kind of information and an account of his personal situation. It had therefore been indispensable to hold a hearing in order to complete the case file in these respects. Moreover, the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal disagreed on the issue whether the applicant\u2019s costs were such that he was entitled to the disability benefits requested. Thus, his case had been of a borderline nature which had further emphasised the need for an oral hearing.\n32. The applicant also found it remarkable that the appellate court had considered a hearing to be unnecessary without giving any further reasons. He therefore could not assess whether the decisions had been in compliance with the 1971 Act.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n33. Noting that the Government have not disputed the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to the case at hand, the Court observes that the proceedings at issue concerned the applicant\u2019s claim to benefits under a social-security scheme. The purpose of the proceedings was to obtain a decision in a dispute over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d, and they accordingly fall within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among other authorities, Duclos v. France, judgment of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011VI, pp. 2179-80, \u00a7 53).\n##### 2. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1\n34. The Court first finds that the entitlement to a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 necessarily implies a right to an \u201coral hearing\u201d. However, the obligation under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to hold a public hearing is not an absolute one. Thus, a hearing may be dispensed with if a party unequivocally waives his or her right thereto and there are no questions of public interest making a hearing necessary. A waiver can be done explicitly or tacitly, in the latter case for example by refraining from submitting or maintaining a request for a hearing (see, among other authorities, H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A, p. 20, \u00a7 66; and Schuler-Zgraggen v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 June 1993, Series A no. 263, pp. 19-20, \u00a7 58).\nFurthermore, a hearing may not be necessary due to exceptional circumstances of the case, for example when it raises no questions of fact or law which cannot be adequately resolved on the basis of the case-file and the parties\u2019 written observations (see, mutatis mutandis, Fredin v. Sweden (no. 2), judgment of 23 February 1994, Series A no. 283-A, pp. 10\u201111, \u00a7\u00a7 21-22; and Fischer v. Austria, judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 44).\n35. In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant did not request a hearing before the County Administrative Court. As Section 9 of the 1971 Act provided that the proceedings before the administrative courts were normally in writing, the applicant could have been expected to request a hearing before that court if he attached importance to it. He did not do so, however, and the Court therefore finds that he can reasonably", "001-59098": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF QUINN v.

Ireland,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr G. Ress, President,\nMr A. Pastor ridruejo,\nMr L. Caflisch,\nMr I. Cabral Barreto,\nMr V. Butkevych,\nMrs N. Vaji\u0107,\nMr M. Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4, judges,\nand Mr V. Berger, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 16 March, 11 July and 12 December 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Pertinent Constitutional provisions\n17. Article 38(1) of the Irish Constitution provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. By Article 40, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.\n#### B. The Offences Against the State Act 1939\n18. The Offences Against the State Act 1939 (\u201cthe 1939 Act\u201d) is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts.\n19. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act.\n20. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances\u2019 legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph).\n21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date.\n22. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act.\n23. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the [police] may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person\u2019s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence.\n2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the [police], fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.\u201d\n24. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the Government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has, with Government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The Committee has commenced its work.\n#### C. Relevant case-law\n25. In the case of the People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan (1979 IR 45) the accused had been arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act and had made certain statements to the police. The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest (section 30), the existence of section 52 of the 1939 Act and even though no section 52 requests had actually been made, the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements. Accordingly, the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible. The Court did not find this argument persuasive since no section 52 requests had in fact been made. It went to point out that, even if section 52 had been invoked by the police, the defence submission was not well-founded because of previous Irish case-law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with Irish law, even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer, were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings.\n26. The Garda Siochana (police) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in association with the Garda Siochana. The commentary on section 52 of the 1939 Act in the sixth edition (1991) provides as follows:\n\u201cThe fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section 52 does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence\u201d\nThe judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the above-cited McGowan case and the earlier Irish case-law approved in the McGowan case.\n27. In the case of Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General ([1994] 2 ILRM), two individuals had been sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act for failing to give an account of their movements. The High Court rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of section 52, considering that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with those persons\u2019 right to silence guaranteed by Article 38 of the Constitution: the objective was to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State; the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational; and other legal protections were available to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act which minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act.\nThose protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligatory informing of the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act.\nThe Supreme Court rejected the appeal (Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General [1996] IR 580). It noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the question of the later use of statements made pursuant to requests of the police under that section. While it noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in the above-cited McGowan case that information lawfully obtained under Section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not.\nThe Supreme Court pointed out that the right to silence was a corollary to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. The relevant assessment was, therefore, to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made under section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force.\nAs to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those, with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime, to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order.\n28. In the case of National Irish Bank Ltd (In the matter of National Irish Bank Ltd and the Companies Act 1990, 1999 1 ILRM 321, at 343) the Supreme Court found that a confession of a bank official obtained by Inspectors as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under Section 10 of the Companies Act 1990 would not, in general, be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless, in any particular case, the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary. The Supreme Court considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under section 52 of the 1939 Act would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.\nTHE LAW\ni. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicant complained that section 52 of the 1939 Act violated his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. Article 6, in so far as is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...\n2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\u2019s submissions\n30. The Government submitted, in the first place, that the applicant\u2019s complaints fell outside the scope of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention. He had, for reasons outlined by the Government, a fair trial in respect of his conviction under section 52 of the 1939 Act. Since Article 6 provides protection of a procedural nature for the determination of a criminal charge, the applicant could not rely on Article 6 to challenge the offence under section 52 itself. In addition, no proceedings were taken against him on charges of membership of an illegal organisation so that he could not, in that respect, complain of a violation of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 of the Convention. The Government also disputed that the applicant could be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 as interpreted by the Serves judgment: the applicant had assumed wrongly that, when he was questioned under section 52, a case existed against him which the police sought to prove as in the Serves case. When questions were put to the present applicant under section 52, no decision had been taken to charge him with any particular crime.\n31. Secondly, the Government pointed to substantial safeguards which exist in order to minimise the risk that an individual may wrongfully confess to a crime, which safeguards were listed by the High Court in the above-cited Heaney and McGuinness case (see paragraph 27 above).\n32. Thirdly, the Government maintained that section 52 of the 1939 Act was a reasonable and appropriate measure given that that section did not provide for, or allow the use, in subsequent criminal proceedings against an accused of information obtained involuntarily from that person.\nIf there had been cases where information obtained pursuant to section 52 had been later introduced in evidence against the accused, the Government could not find any such case. They pointed out that the statement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the above-cited McGowan case on which the applicant relied was obiter dictum since no section 52 requests had been made in that case. In any event, the matter had been clarified for the future by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the above-cited National Irish Bank Ltd case of January 1999. That court found that compelling a person to confess and then convicting him on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. It also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of section 52 statements would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial only if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.\n33. Fourthly, the Government also considered that section 52 of the 1939 Act was a proportionate response given the security situation pertaining in the Irish State relating to Northern Ireland and the consequent concerns to ensure the effective administration of justice and to preserve public peace and order.\nThe Government maintained that, as it is legitimate to impose sanctions in civil matters (such as, for example, taxation matters) when a citizen does not divulge information, the power to obtain information under threat of sanction is all the more necessary in criminal matters where the information sought could be essential for the investigation of serious and subversive crime. The Government recalled that the arrest of the applicant took place in the context of police enquiries consequent on the serious attack in Adare which had been established as having been carried out by an IRA unit.\nThe Government emphasised that section 52 of the 1939 Act remained in force only as long as a proclamation under section 35 of the 1939 Act was in force. As such, section 52 was a part of Irish law only as long as it was considered warranted by a subsisting terrorist and security threat. The Government summarised the duration and level of violence to the date of their observations and detailed recent bombings and other atrocities, referred to a public statement in December 1999 of the Continuity IRA (who are committed to continuing an armed campaign) and outlined recent weapons, explosives and vehicle bomb seizures. Consequently, they considered that the maintenance of the section 35 proclamation continued to be necessary. This necessity had been constantly reviewed, most recently in March 1998, when it was decided to maintain the proclamation in force, the Government noting, in this context, that the single worst atrocity of the entire period of the proclamation occurred in August 1998 when 29 persons lost their lives in a bombing in Omagh. The Government also referred to their commitment as regards the Offences Against the State Acts in the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998.\nMoreover, the use of section 52 of the 1939 was strictly limited to arrests and detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and the circumstances in which section 30 of the 1939 Act came into play were, in turn, strictly limited. The domestic courts were, in addition, vigilant in ensuring that the arrest powers under section 30 were not abused or used for improper purposes (The People (D.P.P.) v. Quilligan and O\u2019Reilly 1986 IR 495 and The State (Trimbole) v. the Governor of Mountjoy Prison 1985 IR 550).\n34. Finally, the Government distinguished the Saunders v. the United Kingdom judgment (of 17 December 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, no. 24) on the basis that the Court condemned the use at trial of evidence obtained from the accused under compulsion but not the means by which that evidence was initially obtained. They also distinguished the Funke v. France judgment (25 February 1993, Series A no. 256-A), pointing out that Mr Funke was subjected to a continuing sanction as long as he refused to provide the requested information. The John Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment (8 February 1996, Reports 1996-I no. 1) was also distinguished, the Government emphasising that Mr Murray\u2019s case related to the subsequent drawing of negative inferences from that applicant\u2019s silence during questioning whereas proceedings had never been taken against the present applicant. The Government considered the Serves v. France case (judgment of 20 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, no. 53) to be similar to the present case but, nevertheless, also distinguishable in that Mr Serves\u2019 objection was premature because he refused to take the oath as a witness rather than being compelled to respond to questions.\n##### 2. The applicant\u2019s submissions\n35. The applicant, citing the above-cited John Murray, Funke, Serves and Saunders\u2019 judgments, argued that Article 6 applied to his complaints because, once he was arrested and questioned, he was \u201ccharged\u201d within the autonomous meaning of that term in Article 6. Moreover, and while he was not complaining about the procedural fairness of the proceedings by which he was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment, his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention were violated by his being obliged to spend time in prison for maintaining his defence rights once he had been so \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of Article 6. If he was excluded from relying on the relevant Article 6 rights because he had not been \u201ccharged\u201d under Irish law or because he was not subsequently proceeded against on those \u201ccharges\u201d, the relevant guarantees of Article 6 would be rendered ineffective.\n36. As to the Government\u2019s suggestion that any statements made by the applicant pursuant to the section 52 requests would not have been later admissible in evidence against him, the applicant argued that the judicial statements that existed prior to the National Irish Bank Ltd case indicated that such statements would be admissible. He referred, in particular, to the above-cited Court of Criminal Appeal case of McGowan as one of the most authoritative statements on the point when, in July 1996, he was arrested and questioned. He further referred to the comments of the Supreme Court in the above-cited Heaney and McGuinness case on the McGowan case (also cited above). The applicant also pointed to the sixth edition (1991) of the Garda Siochana Handbook which accepted that such statements were admissible in evidence against their authors.\nIn addition, it was standard practice that police notes of interviews of persons detained under section 30 of the 1939 Act were tendered in evidence when such persons were charged and tried, which notes routinely included responses to section 52 requests for information. Indeed, he noted that during his many interviews with the police, the numerous section 52 requests were intermingled with \u2018normal\u2019 questioning so that it was impossible to know where the section 52 questioning began and ended.\nHowever, the applicant accepted that the National Irish Bank Ltd case ruled out the use of section 52 statements in the future unless they were shown to be voluntary. However, that case did allow the admission of evidence obtained as a result or in consequence of section 52 statements obtained.\n37. The applicant further considered that the Government had overstated the threat to national security at the time of his arrest. He underlined the fact that the section 35 proclamation had been in force since 1972 and, accordingly, had become a quasi-permanent part of Irish law. Nevertheless, there had been a steady decline in the pattern and level of violence since the early 1990s and he cited, inter alia, statistics taken from a report of Ireland under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1992-6).\nHe further pointed out that there was no provision for regular independent reviews of the necessity for the continuance of the section 35 proclamation and that no such review had ever been carried out. The recently established review body to which the Government referred was the first ever independent review of the Offences Against the State Acts but the Government had given no indication as to when it would complete its work.\n38. Finally, and although no violation was found in the Serves case, the applicant considered that there had been a violation in his case: questions were put to him whereas the Court found that Mr Serves\u2019 refusal to take the oath, before he had been questioned, was premature; the applicant was arrested for questioning by the police about his involvement in suspected offences; and he was imprisoned, as opposed to fined, for failing to answer questions. As to the Government\u2019s submission that the above-cited John Murray case implied that the right to silence could be restricted in response to national security threats, the applicant argued that inferences could be drawn in that case \u201cin situations which clearly called for an explanation\u201d from the individual in question: there were no circumstances which called for explanation in his case. In fact, the Court stated in the John Murray case that it was incompatible with Article 6 to base a conviction solely or mainly on an accused\u2019s silence whereas that was precisely what happened to him.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Convention\n39. The Government argued that Article 6 could not apply to the applicant\u2019s complaints because he had not been charged when the section 52 requests were put to him, because no proceedings issued against him on charges of membership of the IRA and because he had a fair hearing on the charge under section 52 of the 1939 Act. The applicant considered that he had been \u201ccharged\u201d within the meaning of that term in Article 6 of the Convention and that he was entitled to rely on Article 6 \u00a7 1 because he was convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for having defended his defence rights guaranteed by Article 6.\n40. The Court recalls its established case-law to the effect that, although not specifically mentioned in Article 6 of the Convention, the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of the notion of a fair procedure under Article 6.\nTheir rationale lies, inter alia, in the protection of the accused against improper compulsion by the authorities, thereby contributing to the avoidance of miscarriages of justice and to the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6. The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular, presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this sense the right in question is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention (the above-cited Saunders judgment, \u00a7 68).\nThe right not to incriminate oneself is primarily concerned, however, with respecting the will of an accused person to remain silent. The Court would note, in this context, that the present case does not concern a request, through the use of compulsory powers, of material which had an existence independent of the will of the applicants such as, documents or blood samples (also the above-cited Saunders judgment, \u00a7 69).\n41. The Court observes that the applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention about having been punished through the application of section 52 of the 1939 Act, for having invoked his rights to silence, against self-incrimination and to be presumed innocent during police questioning in the course of a serious criminal investigation. It recalls that the autonomous meaning of the expression \u201ccharge\u201d in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention means that a person can be considered to have been \u201ccharged\u201d for the pur", "001-147679": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF DAVID THOMAS v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n35. The relevant domestic law and practice is set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee v. the United Kingdom, nos. 25119/09, 57715/09 and 57877/09, 18 September 2012.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n36. The applicant complained of a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because of an alleged failure of the authorities to put in place the necessary resources to enable him to demonstrate to the Parole Board that his risk had reduced and a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 4 on the ground that his Parole Board review in 2011 was, in these circumstances, a meaningless exercise. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 read as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n(a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court ....\n...\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n37. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint essentially concerns adequate access to courses and that it is appropriate to examine it from the angle of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention only (see James, Wells and Lee, cited above).\n38. The Government contested the argument that there had been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in the case.\n#### A. Admissibility\n39. The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies since he had not commenced judicial review proceedings alleging a breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In the alternative, they invited the Court to declare the applicant\u2019s complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. Citing Hall v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 24712/12, \u00a7 32, 12 November 2013, they argued that the applicant had been given access to numerous courses and assessments both pre- and post-tariff and that his post-tariff detention could therefore not be considered \u201carbitrary\u201d.\n40. The applicant maintained that he had satisfied Article 35 \u00a7 1, since any judicial review claim would have failed on account of the House of Lords\u2019 refusal to find a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in James, Wells and Lee. He also refuted the suggestion that his case was similar to the Hall case, emphasising that he had been given no access whatsoever to courses between September 2010 and May 2012.\n41. The Court is satisfied that at the point at which the applicant lodged his application, the possibility of judicial review proceedings offered no prospect of success as regards systemic delay in access to rehabilitative courses (see Black v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 23543/11, \u00a7 52, 1 July 2014). The Government\u2019s objection is accordingly dismissed.\n42. The Court further considers that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention and is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The parties\u2019 submissions\n43. The applicant relied on this Court\u2019s judgment in James, Wells and Lee, cited above. He considered it clear from the decision of the Parole Board in August 2011 that the only way that he could address his risk was by completing the SOTP (see paragraph 23 above). He argued that it was not proportionate that he had waited two and a half years for a course which took only six months to complete. He was of the view that had appropriate resources been in place, his assessment for the course would have been completed in two months.\n44. The applicant further emphasised that his tariff period was only one year and nineteen days, and he had not been convicted of a sexual offence. The need to complete the SOTP was solely to address potential future risk.\n45. The Government argued that the Court should not apply James, Wells and Lee in the present case since, in their submission, the case had been wrongly decided.\n46. In the alternative, they contended that even if the principles in James, Wells and Lee were applied here, there had been no violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 in this case. They emphasised that prior to tariff expiry, there had been no reason to believe that there was any risk of sexual offending. Once this had been revealed by the applicant in September 2010, he had been swiftly reassessed. By January 2011, discussions had taken place between the prison staff and the psychology department regarding the applicant\u2019s treatment needs and by June 2011 he had been informed of his referral for TNA and RM2000 assessments. The assessments had been concluded and the applicant provided with copies of the reports by December 2011. The applicant had clearly been progressed through the prison system and kept informed of developments. There had been no two and a half year delay, as alleged by the applicant. Nineteen months had elapsed between the applicant\u2019s first admission that his offending had a sexual element and his commencement of the SOTP. During this time, steps were being taken by prison staff to address the applicant\u2019s needs. At no time did his post-tariff detention become arbitrary.\n##### 2. The Court\u2019s assessment\n47. The Court sees no reason not to apply the principles set out in James, Wells and Lee, cited above, to the facts of the present case.\n48. In James, Wells and Lee, cited above, \u00a7 209, the Court explained that in cases concerning indeterminate sentences of imprisonment for the protection of the public, a real opportunity for rehabilitation was a necessary element of any part of the detention which was to be justified solely by reference to public protection. This required reasonable opportunities to undertake courses ", "001-76303": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF SAADI v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Saadi v. the United Kingdom,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. The Immigration Act 1971 provides for the administrative detention of those subject to immigration control \u201cpending examination and pending a decision whether to give or refuse ... leave to enter\u201d (Schedule 2, paragraph 16). Temporary admission is used as an alternative to detention. It is a form of licensed consent to enter the United Kingdom which may be subjected to conditions, including reporting requirements and restrictions on the person\u2019s residence, employment or occupation (Schedule 2, paragraph 21).\n18. In general (that is, in cases other than those involving Oakington), the SSHD\u2019s guidance requires an individual assessment of the need to detain to prevent absconding.\n19. On 16 March 2000 Barbara Roche MP, Minister of State at the Home Office, announced a change in detention policy specifically and exclusively related to the new Oakington Reception Centre. Oakington asylum applicants could be detained where it appeared that their application was capable of being decided \u2018quickly\u2019, including those which may be certified as being \u2018manifestly unfounded\u2019. To assist immigration officers, lists of nationalities \u2013 and categories within nationalities - were drawn up in respect of which consideration at Oakington could be justified because they were expected to be simple to deal with. It was said that Oakington would strengthen the ability of the Home Office to deal quickly with asylum applications.\n20. Further guidance was issued in the Operational Enforcement Manual in respect of individuals who were said to be unsuitable for Oakington detention. Cases in which detention at Oakington would not be suitable included the following:\n- any case which did not appear to be one in which a quick decision could be reached or in which there were complicating factors;\n- unaccompanied minor asylum seekers;\n- cases in which there was a dispute as to age;\n- disabled applicants;\n- persons with special medical needs;\n- cases involving disputes as to nationality; and\n- cases where the asylum seeker was violent or uncooperative.\n21. In addition, all persons believed to be at risk of absconding (from Oakington) were not deemed suitable for detention at Oakington.\n22. The Oakington Reception Centre has high perimeter fences, locked gates and twenty-four hour security guards. The site is large, with space for outdoor recreation and general association and on-site legal advice is available. There is a canteen, a library, a medical centre, social visits room and a religious observance room. The following description was used in the present case:\n\u201cAll of the normal facilities provided within an immigration detention centre are available \u2013 restaurant, medical centre, social visits room, religious observance and recreation. The practical operation and facilities at Oakington are, however, very different from other detention centres. In particular, there is a relaxed regime with minimal physical security, reflecting the fact that the purpose is to consider and decide applications. The site itself is very open with a large area for outdoor recreation and general association or personal space. Applicants and their dependents are free to move about the site although, in the interests of privacy and safety, there are two areas where only females and families may go.\u201d\n23. The \u2018House Rules\u2019 for Oakington require, inter alia, that detainees must vacate or return to their room when required; that mail may be required to be opened in front of officers; that detainees must eat at set times and that visits can only be received at particular times. Further, detainees must carry identification at all times (to be shown to officers on request); must obey all staff and attend roll-calls. Male detainees are accommodated separately from their spouses and children and cannot stay with them overnight.\nTHE LAW\n### I . ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicant contended that his detention at the Oakington Reception Centre from 2 to 9 January 2001 was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. That provision reads, so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The Government\n25. The Government accepted that the applicant\u2019s stay at Oakington constituted a \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d for the purposes of Article 5. They considered, however, that the wording of the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) \u2013 detention \u201cto prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry\u201d - described the factual state of affairs where a person was seeking to effect an entry but had no authorisation, that being a matter under consideration by the State of entry, and that it did not require the additional feature of an attempted evasion of immigration control. If it were otherwise \u2013 that is, if a person who applied for asylum could not be detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because he was seeking to effect an authorised, rather than an unauthorised entry \u2013 States would be required to authorise entry to all who seek it. It would not even be possible to detain for short periods to make arrangements and verify identity.\n26. The Government also contested the applicant\u2019s thesis that asylum seekers may only be detained where detention is \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to prevent the person absconding or otherwise misbehaving. They noted that Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) contains such a provision, but Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not, and underlined that in the context of detention with a view to deportation, the Court confirmed such an interpretation in Chahal (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, \u00a7 112). The Government considered that the conclusion in Chahal, which was confirmed in \u010conka (\u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, \u00a7 38, ECHR 2002-I), applies equally to detention with a view to preventing unauthorised detention.\n27. Finally, the Government contended that, in any event, the applicant\u2019s detention was not disproportionate in the circumstances: it was only possible to interview large numbers of applicants in a short time-frame if the applicants were available at short or no notice; the use of nationality as a criterion for choosing candidates for Oakington was only one of a number of criteria and was perfectly proper and justified, and the applicant\u2019s contention that the use of detention was influenced by the reaction of local residents and planning committees was not made out, as the domestic courts which considered the point had also found.\n##### 2. The applicant\n28. The applicant maintained his claim that to detain a person who presented no threat to immigration control simply in order to accelerate a decision concerning their entry did not \u201cprevent\u201d unauthorised entry, and was not compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f): there was no risk of the applicant absconding, and indeed Oakington was only used to detain those who were not at risk of absconding. Article 5 \u00a71 (f) did not, however, prevent detention, for example, while an assessment was being made of whether an individual presented an unacceptable risk of absconding and thereby effecting an unauthorised entry.\n29. The applicant underlined that the detention in his case was wholly unrelated to whether he was granted entry: he was granted temporary admission both before and after the period of detention in question, and entry at those times was not \u201cunauthorised\u201d. After a person has been assessed not to present a risk of absconding, examination of his claim and immigration control could be carried out without detention.\n30. For the applicant, detention was such a serious measure that it was only justified where other, less severe measures had been considered and found to be insufficient. The applicant cited with approval the first instance judge who said \u201cSurely measures short of detention should be tried first and detention should be regarded as the last resort\u201d.\n#### B. The Court\u2019s assessment\n##### 1. General principles of detention under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f)\n31. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) permits the lawful arrest or detention of a person in two circumstances. The first is arrest or detention to prevent the person effecting an unauthorised entry into the country. The second is the arrest or detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.\n32. In a number of cases, the Court has had to consider the meaning of the second limb. In the case of Kolompar, it accepted that the applicant\u2019s detention was in principle justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) where an extradition request had been made and the applicant was no longer detained under Article 5 \u00a7 1(a) or (c) (Kolompar v. Belgium, judgment of 24 September 1992, Series A no. 235\u2011C, \u00a7 36). The Court did not consider whether the applicant\u2019s detention was necessary in order to ensure that he could be extradited, or whether a less intrusive measure would have achieved the same aim.\n33. In the above-mentioned case of Chahal, the Court expressly determined (at \u00a7 112) the question whether the second limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) contained a \u201cnecessity\u201d test:\n\u201c... it is not in dispute that Mr Chahal has been detained with a \u2018view to deportation\u2019 within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) (...). Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) does not demand that the detention of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing; in this respect Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) provides a different level of protection from Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).\nIndeed, all that is required under this provision is that \u2018action is being taken with a view to deportation\u2019. It is therefore immaterial, for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), whether the underlying decision to expel can be justified under national or Convention law\u201d\nThe Court then noted (at \u00a7 113) that any such deprivation of liberty was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) only for as long as deportation proceedings were in progress. If the proceedings were not prosecuted with due diligence, the detention would cease to be permissible under the provision. The Court further examined whether the detention was \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) with particular reference to the safeguards provided by the national system (\u00a7 118).\n34. The Court\u2019s approach in Chahal was reiterated in the above-mentioned case of \u010conka (\u010conka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, ECHR 2002\u2011I) in which it stated that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) did not require that the detention of a person against whom action was being taken with a view to deportation be reasonably considered necessary (\u00a7 38).\n35. In Amuur the Court explained that although it was possible for the holding of aliens in an international zone to be interpreted as a restriction on liberty rather than a deprivation of liberty, in the circumstances of the case, the applicants were deprived of their liberty, such that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) applied (Amuur v. France, judgment of 25 June 1996, Reports 1996\u2011III, \u00a7\u00a7 43-49). The Court concluded in the case that the provision had been violated because the domestic legal rules at the relevant time did not sufficiently guarantee the applicants\u2019 right to liberty (\u00a7 54). It was not required to arrive at any detailed conclusions as to the test to be applied to detention contended to fall within Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) because the case turned on the quality of the domestic rules which were applicable. It did, however, comment generally on the way in which Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) was to be interpreted. In particular, it held at \u00a7 50 that:\n\u201cWhere the \u201clawfulness\u201c of detention is in issue, including the question whether \u2018a procedure prescribed by law\u2019 has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law, but it requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of Article 5, namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, among many other authorities, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 19-20,\u00a7 42).\nIn laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be effected \u2018in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\u2019, Article 5 \u00a7 1 primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law. ...\u201d\n36. By contrast, the Court has considered the stringency of the test to be applied in cases under other heads of Article 5 \u00a7 1. In the case of Article 5 \u00a7 1(b), for example, it has underlined the need for a \u201creasonable balance ... between the importance of securing the fulfilment of the obligations in general and the importance of the right to liberty\u201d (Vasileva v. Denmark, no. 52792/99, \u00a7 38, 25 September 2003). In the context of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (e), the Court has emphasised that \u201cit does not suffice that the deprivation of liberty is executed in conformity with national law but it must also be necessary in the circumstances\u201d (Witold Litwa v. Poland, no. 26629/95, \u00a7 78, ECHR 2000\u2011III). As the Court noted in Chahal (see above), Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) of the Convention provides in terms that detention must be \u201creasonably considered necessary to prevent [a person\u2019s] committing an offence or fleeing after having done so\u201d to be compatible with the provision.\n##### 2. Application of the general principles\n37. The Court notes that the facts in the present case are not in dispute. The applicant was not detained for the first three days of his presence in the United Kingdom, and he was then detained at the Oakington Centre, a centre which was used for those who were not likely to abscond and who could be dealt with by a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure.\n38. The present case therefore turns on whether the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington fell within the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), which permits the lawful detention \u201cof a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country\u201d.\n39. The first question which the Court must address is whether a person who has presented himself to the immigration authorities and has been granted temporary admission to the country can be considered as a person who is seeking to effect an \u201cunauthorised entry\u201d into the country.\n40. The Court does not accept that, as soon as a potential immigrant has surrendered himself to the immigration authorities, he is seeking to effect an \u201cauthorised\u201d entry, with the result that detention cannot be justified under the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). In particular, it is a normal part of States\u2019 \u201cundeniable right to control aliens\u2019 entry into and residence in their country\u201d (Amuur v. France, cited above, \u00a7 41) that States are permitted to detain would-be immigrants who have applied for permission to enter, whether by way of asylum or not. Such detention must be compatible with the overall purpose of Article 5, which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness, but it is evident from the tenor of the judgment in Amuur (referred to above) that the detention of potential immigrants is capable of being compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f). As to the difference between a short period of detention on arrival in a country in order to assess the risk of absconding (which the applicant accepts is compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f)) and subsequent detention in order to facilitate the processing of cases (which he does not), the Court agrees with the Government that, until a potential immigrant has been granted leave to remain in the country, he has not effected a lawful entry, and detention can reasonably be considered to be aimed at preventing unlawful entry.\n41. The Court therefore considers that, although the applicant had applied for asylum and had been granted temporary admission to the country on 30 December 2000, and had been at large (albeit after being granted only temporary admission and subject to conditions) until 2 January 2001, his detention from that date was nevertheless to prevent his effecting an unlawful entry because, absent formal admission clearance, he had not \u201clawfully\u201d entered the country.\n42. The next question for the Court, which is also the question which taxed the domestic courts, is whether it is permissible for a State to detain a potential asylum seeker or immigrant in circumstances where there is no risk of his absconding or other misconduct. The question is particularly well-defined in the present case as the applicant was held at Oakington, a centre used only for those who did not present a risk of absconding (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above) and where the application could be considered quickly (paragraphs 19 and 20 above).\n43. Mr Justice Collins, the first-instance judge in the present case, found that domestic law did not impose a \u201cnecessity\u201d test, with the result that the detention was compatible with the domestic law. In considering Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f), however, he did not accept that the applicant needed to be detained because there was no risk that he would abscond or otherwise misbehave. That finding was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which considered that Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) required immigration authorities not to prolong unduly the detention of aliens pending consideration of applications for leave to enter, or for deportation, but that it did not apply a necessity test to those procedures. The House of Lords underlined that the aim of detention at Oakington was to speed up immigration procedures by using a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure which could be applied in relatively straightforward cases. It, too, considered that in the absence of any express or implied necessity test in the Convention or the Convention case-law, immigration detention could be compatible with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) even though it was not \u201cnecessary\u201d. The House of Lords added, in connection with the question whether detention was a disproportionate response to the reasonable requirements of immigration control, that the need for speedy determination of claims favoured accepting the Oakington procedure as proportionate and reasonable.\n44. Detention of a person is a major interference with personal liberty, and must always be subject to close scrutiny. Where individuals are lawfully at large in a country, the authorities may only detain if \u2013 as the Court expressed the position in Vasileva (referred to above) \u2013 a \u201creasonable balance\u201d is struck between the requirements of society and the individual\u2019s freedom. The position regarding potential immigrants, whether they are applying for asylum or not, is different to the extent that, until their application for immigration clearance and/or asylum has been dealt with, they are not \u201cauthorised\u201d to be on the territory. Subject, as always, to the rule against arbitrariness, the Court accepts that the State has a broader discretion to decide whether to detain potential immigrants than is the case for other interferences with the right to liberty. Accordingly, and this finding does no more than apply to the first limb of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) the ruling the Court has already made as regards the second limb of the provision, there is no requirement in Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) that the detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country be reasonably considered necessary, for example to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing. All that is required is that the detention should be a genuine part of the process to determine whether the individual should be granted immigration clearance and/or asylum, and that it should not otherwise be arbitrary, for example on account of its length.\n45. It is plain that in the present case the applicant\u2019s detention at Oakington was a bona fide application of the policy on \u201cfas", "001-57886": "\ufeff\nCOURT (CHAMBER)\nCASE OF WYNNE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM\n(Application no. 15484/89)\nJUDGMENT\nSTRASBOURG\n18 July 1994\nIn the case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom\uf02a,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr F. G\u00f6lc\u00fckl\u00fc,\nMr F. Matscher,\nMr B. Walsh,\nMr C. Russo,\nMr A. Spielmann,\nSir John Freeland,\nMr M.A. Lopes Rocha,\nMr L. Wildhaber,\nand also of Mr M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 February and 22 June 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Life sentences\n12. Murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. A person convicted of manslaughter may be sentenced to life imprisonment at the discretion of the trial judge. Such a discretionary life sentence of imprisonment may also be passed in certain other cases where the offence is grave and where there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside (see, in this connection, the Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n#### B. Release on licence and revocation of a licence\n13. Under section 61 of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State may release on licence a person sentenced to life imprisonment only if recommended to do so by the Parole Board, and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and the trial judge if available. By virtue of section 62 (1) the Secretary of State may revoke the licence of a person whose recall to prison is recommended by the Parole Board.\n14. Under section 62 (7) of the 1967 Act, if a person subject to a licence is convicted on indictment of an offence, the trial court may, whether or not it passes any other sentence on him, revoke the licence.\n15. The effect of revocation of a licence, whether by the Secretary of State or by a court, is that the person is liable to be detained in pursuance of his sentence (section 62 (9) of the 1967 Act).\n16. It is the duty of the Parole Board to advise the Secretary of State with respect to, inter alia, the release on licence under section 61, and the recall under section 62, of persons whose cases have been referred to the Board by the Secretary of State (section 59 of the 1967 Act; see also the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 21-22, paras. 57-58).\n#### C. Procedures for review of life sentences\n17. Prior to 1992, in respect of both mandatory and discretionary life sentences, the Secretary of State would receive the views of the judiciary (the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice) on the period deemed necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence (\u201cthe tariff period\u201c) and of the Parole Board on the question of risk. The Secretary of State would decide when, if at all, it was appropriate to release the prisoner on life licence.\nHe accepted the views of the judiciary, in discretionary life sentence cases, as to the length of the tariff period. However, in mandatory life sentence cases he formed his own judgment on that question, taking into account the views of the judiciary (for the distinction between discretionary and mandatory life sentences, see the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, pp. 19-20, paras. 50-53).\n18. Following the judgment of the European Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (loc. cit.) changes to the procedures for the release of discretionary life prisoners were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201c). Parliament decided, however, not to extend these changes to mandatory life sentences. Under section 34 of this Act discretionary life prisoners are now informed by the trial judge, in open court, of the tariff period appropriate for the offence. After the expiry of that period, the prisoner has a right to be released on life licence if and when the Parole Board decides that it is safe to do so. They are entitled to appear before the Board in person, to see all the reports placed before it, and to call witnesses and submit documentary evidence. When the Board decides that a prisoner should be released the Secretary of State is under a duty to do so (section 34 (3) of the 1991 Act).\nSection 34 (7) (a) of the 1991 Act specifically excludes from eligibility for review under the new procedures a discretionary life prisoner who is also serving a mandatory life sentence.\n19. In the debate in the House of Commons on 16 July 1991 concerning this legislation, the Minister of State for the Home Department made the following statement concerning the differences between mandatory and discretionary life sentences:\n\u201cMandatory life sentence cases ... raise quite different issues and the Government do not agree that it is appropriate to extend a similar procedure to these cases. In a discretionary case, the decision on release is based purely on whether the offender continues to be a risk to the public. The presumption is that once the period that is appropriate to punishment has passed, the prisoner should be released if it is safe to do so.\nThe nature of the mandatory sentence is different. The element of risk is not the decisive factor in handing down a life sentence. According to the judicial process, the offender has committed a crime of such gravity that he forfeits his liberty to the State for the rest of his days. If necessary, he can be detained for life without the necessity for a subsequent judicial intervention.\nThe presumption is, therefore, that the offender should remain in custody until and unless the Home Secretary concludes that the public interest would be better served by the prisoner\u2019s release than by his continued detention. In exercising his continued discretion in this respect, the Home Secretary must take account not just of the question of risk, but of how society as a whole would view the prisoner\u2019s release at that juncture. The Home Secretary takes account of the judicial recommendation, but the final decision is his.\u201c\n20. In relation to mandatory life prisoners, the Secretary of State continues to decide the length of the tariff after considering advice from the judiciary and any representations which the prisoner wishes to make. After the expiry of that period, he has power to release the prisoner on life licence if recommended to do so by the Parole Board. The decision on whether to release is for him alone.\n21. On 27 July 1993 the Secretary of State made a statement in Parliament explaining his practice in relation to mandatory life prisoners. The statement emphasised that before any mandatory life prisoner is released on life licence, the Secretary of State\n\u201cwill consider not only, (a) whether the period served by the prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe to release the prisoner, but also (c) the public acceptability of early release. This means that I will only exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfied that to do so will not threaten the maintenance of public confidence in the system of criminal justice\u201c.\n22. In determining the principles of fairness that apply to the procedures governing review of mandatory life sentences, the English courts have recognised that the mandatory sentence is, like the discretionary sentence, composed of both a punitive period (the \u201ctariff\u201c) and a security period. As regards the latter, detention is linked to the assessment of the prisoner\u2019s risk to the public following the expiry of the \u201ctariff\u201c (R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Bradley (Divisional Court) [1991] 1 Weekly Law Reports 135; R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Wilson (Court of Appeal) [1992] 2 All England Reports 576; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Cox (judgment of the Divisional Court of 4 September 1992); R. v. Parole Board, ex parte Creamer and Scholey (judgment of the Divisional Court of 21 October 1992)).\n23. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1993] 3 All England Reports 92, the House of Lords observed that, in contrast with the position as regards discretionary life sentences, the theory and the practice in respect of mandatory life sentences were out of tune.\nIn his speech, with which the other Law Lords agreed, Lord Mustill explained that the policy whereby murder was treated as an offence so grave that the proper penal element of the sentence was detention for life was inconsistent with the practice adopted by successive Secretaries of State that a mandatory life sentence included a \u201ctariff\u201c period to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. A mandatory life prisoner knew that once he had served the penal element of his sentence the penal consequences of his crime had been exhausted.\nNevertheless, the Secretary of State was not obliged to adopt the judicial view of the \u201ctariff\u201c period and it was he who was entrusted with the task of deciding on the prisoner\u2019s release. He was entitled to depart from the judge\u2019s advice and to have regard to broader considerations of a public character than those which applied to an ordinary sentencing function. He added (loc. cit., p. 105):\n\u201cThe discretionary and mandatory life sentences, having in the past grown apart, may now be converging. Nevertheless, on the statutory framework, the underlying theory and the current practice there remains a substantial gap between them. It may be - I express no opinion - that the time is approaching when the effect of the two types of life sentence should be further assimilated. But this is a task for Parliament, and I think it quite impossible for the courts to introduce a fundamental change in the relationship between the convicted murderer and the State, through the medium of judicial review.\u201c\nLord Mustill considered that, having regard to the rights which discretionary prisoners had, the Secretary of State was required to comply with the following requirements of procedural fairness when fixing the penal element in a mandatory life sentence: the Secretary of State must inform such a prisoner of the judicial advice on the length of the \u201ctariff\u201c, and give him the opportunity to make written representations on that subject before he decides on the appropriate term of years. If the Secretary of State departs from the judicial advice, he must give reasons for doing so.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n24. The applicant lodged his application (15484/89) on 15 June 1989.\nHe complained under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention that he was unable to have the continued lawfulness of his detention reviewed by a tribunal.\nHe also complained about a number of other matters, including an alleged assault by prison staff in June 1985 and his transfer from hospital to prison subsequent to December 1985. He further claimed that he had been prevented from defending himself and had no domestic remedies available to him in respect of his various complaints. In these connections he relied on Articles 6, 8, 10 and 13 (art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 13) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).\n25. On 15 October 1992 the Commission declared the applicant\u2019s complaint admissible in so far as it raised issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.

Sweden (no. 2)\uf02a,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201c) and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R.

Eissen, Registrar, and Mr H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 September 1993 and 25 January 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n11. The 1988 Act was introduced as a result of the European Court\u2019s findings in several cases, notably against Sweden, that lack of judicial review of certain administrative decisions infringed Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (see, for instance, the Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, pp. 29-31, paras. 78-87; the Pudas v. Sweden and the Bod\u00e9n v. Sweden judgments of 27 October 1987, respectively Series A no. 125-A, pp. 13-17, paras. 28-42, and Series A no. 125-B, pp. 39-42, paras. 26-37). It was enacted as a temporary law to remain in force until 1991; its validity was subsequently extended to the end of 1994.\n12. Pursuant to section 1 of this Act, a person who has been a party to administrative proceedings before the Government or another public authority may, in the absence of any other remedy, apply to the Supreme Administrative Court, as the first and only judicial instance, for review of any decisions in the case which involve the exercise of public authority vis-\u00e0-vis a private individual. The kind of administrative decision covered by the Act is further defined in Chapter 8, sections 2 and 3 of the Instrument of Government, to which section 1 of the 1988 Act refers. Section 2 of the Act specifies several types of decisions which fall outside its scope, none of which is relevant in the instant case.\nIn proceedings brought under the 1988 Act, the Supreme Administrative Court examines whether the contested decision \u201cconflicts with any legal rule\u201c (section 1 of the 1988 Act). According to the preparatory work to the Act, as reproduced in Government Bill 1987/88:69 (pp. 23-24), its review of the merits of cases concerns essentially questions of law but may, in so far as is relevant for the application of the law, extend also to factual issues; it must also consider whether there are any procedural errors which may have affected the outcome of the case.\n13. If the Supreme Administrative Court finds that the impugned decision is unlawful, it must quash it and, where necessary, refer the case back to the relevant administrative authority (section 5 of the 1988 Act, as applicable at the relevant time).\n14. The procedure before the Supreme Administrative Court is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act 1971. It is in principle a written procedure, but the Supreme Administrative Court may decide to hold an oral hearing on specific matters if this is likely to assist it in its examination of the case or to expedite the proceedings (section 9).\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n15. In his application of 9 April 1991 (no. 18928/91) to the Commission, Mr Fredin alleged that he had been denied a \u201cfair and public hearing\u201c before the Supreme Administrative Court, in breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\n16. On 12 October 1992 the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 9 February 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion, by sixteen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT\n17. At the hearing on 21 September 1993, the Government repeated the invitation made in their letter of 23 August (see paragraph 4 above) and calling upon the Court to rule on whether the facts of the present case disclose a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\n18. Mr Fredin invoked Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) which, in so far as relevant, provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201c\nThis provision is applicable to the proceedings in issue and this has not been disputed before the Court. On the other hand, the applicant\u2019s contention that it had been violated, accepted by the Commission, was contested by the Government.\n19. As to the general scope of the right to an oral hearing in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the Government maintained that to regard this right as unconditional might exacerbate what was already a major problem for courts in the Contracting States, namely the excessive length of proceedings. In cases where the issues to be decided were of a purely legal nature, there was no real need for an oral hearing; as has been suggested by the dissenting members of the Commission, legal arguments could often be presented more effectively in writing than orally.\nWith regard to the specific circumstances of the case, the Government stressed that the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s role was primarily to review the lawfulness of the decision before it and to determine whether it should be upheld or quashed; it could not substitute its own decision. It had refused the applicant an oral hearing because the majority of the judges sitting on the case had found they did not require a clarification of the facts in order to be able to reach a decision; since the case only gave rise to questions of law, an oral hearing could not have assisted the Supreme Administrative Court in its examination.\n20.

O'Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 5 October 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant provisions of the Army Act 1955 which regulated court-martial procedures at the relevant time are set out in the above-cited Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 32-51).\n17. Following the Commission's report in the Findlay case (Findlay v. the United Kingdom, no. 22107/93, Commission's report of 5 September 1995), it was decided that, as and from 1 January 1996, all courts-martial would be composed of presidents and members not in the chain of command of the convening officer. Thereafter, the 1955 Act was amended substantially by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (\u201cthe 1996 Act\u201d) which came into force on 1 April 1997. The new court-martial system for which the 1996 Act provides is summarised in the Findlay judgment (at \u00a7\u00a7 52-57) and is outlined in more detail in the case of Cooper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 48843/99, \u00a7\u00a7 15-76, ECHR 2003-XII).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicants complained that they had not been afforded a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law: they considered their courts-martial to lack structural independence and objective impartiality and they relied on the above-cited Findlay judgment. The Government disagreed.\n19. Article 6 \u00a7 1, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n20. Other than arguing that the complaint was manifestly ill-founded, the Government did not raise any other objection to its admissibility.\n21. It is not disputed that the final decision in the applicants' proceedings was that of the CMAC of 13 November 1998. Their complaints were introduced on 11 January 1999 and, therefore, within the six-month time-limit set down by Article 34 of the Convention. In addition, the Court is of the view that, given the nature of the charges (serious criminal charges under domestic law) together with the nature and severity of the penalties imposed (serious sentences of imprisonment), their courts-martial determined criminal charges against them within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (Engel and Others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, \u00a7\u00a7 82-83 and, more recently, Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], Nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7 69-130, ECHR 2003-X and the above-cited Cooper v. the United Kingdom judgment, \u00a7 80.)\n22. The Court considers that the applicants' case raises a question of law which is sufficiently serious that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits and no other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established. The Court therefore declares the case admissible.\nIn accordance with its decision to apply Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 3 above), the Court will immediately consider the merits of this complaint.\n#### B. Merits\n23. The Government mainly argued that the present cases were distinguishable from the above-cited Findlay case given the policy in place from 1 January 1996 to the effect that the president and members of the applicants' courts-martial were not in the convening officer's chain of command (although they were lower in rank to that officer) and were also all outside the \u201cchain of command area\u201d of the applicants. In addition, the convening officer could only dissolve the court-martial in prescribed circumstances. The post-trial review procedure did not affect the independence of a court-martial, the Court's misgivings in Findlay arising from the role of the convening officer as opposed to any post-trial procedures. They further considered that the delivery of the above-cited Cooper judgment confirmed their point of view.\n24. The applicants disagreed with the Government's interpretation of the Findlay judgment (they were of the view that the change in practice after January 1996 was insufficient to overcome the difficulties identified in that judgment) and also considered the Government's reliance on the above-cited Cooper judgment to be misplaced (since that latter case concerned the post-1996 Act system and their case concerned the system in place prior to the 1996 Act). In any event, they maintained that an entirely military court-martial could not try criminal charges compatibly with the independence requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n25. In addition, the applicants pointed out that Presidents of courts-martial were not legally qualified and their presence was difficult to justify given the presence of judge advocates. The rank structure of courts-martial put pressure on the junior members. The judge advocates were not members and had no vote on findings or sentence. No reasons were given for the sentences imposed and the judge advocate's advice to the courts-martial was not made public. No reasons were given for the rejection of the applicants' petitions prior to the CMAC proceedings. They had no right to appeal to the CMAC against sentence only. The applicants further argued that the post-trial review procedures themselves breached certain fundamental principles of Article 6 of the Convention.\n26. The Court notes, at the outset, that it has recently rejected the submission, repeated by the present applicants, that service tribunals could not, by definition, try criminal charges against service personnel consistently with the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (the Cooper judgment, at \u00a7\u00a7 108-110).\n27. The Court recalls the relevant Convention principles concerning the independence and impartiality requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see the above-cited Cooper judgment, \u00a7 104):\n\u201c...in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered \u201cindependent\u201d, regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and to the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence.\n... what is at stake is the confidence which such tribunals in a democratic society must inspire in the public and above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. In deciding whether there is a legitimate reason to fear that a particular court lacked independence or impartiality, the standpoint of the accused is important without being decisive. What is decisive is whether his doubts can be held to be objectively justified ... .\u201d\n... the tribunal ... must ... b", "001-61680": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF HIRST v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 provides:\n\u201c(1) A convicted person during the time that he is detained in a penal institution in pursuance of his sentence ...is legally incapable of voting at any parliamentary or local election.\u201d\nThis section re-enacted without debate the provisions of section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1969, the substance of which back dated to the Forfeiture Act 1870 of the previous century, which in turn reflected earlier rules of law relating to the forfeiture of certain rights by a convicted \u201cfelon\u201d (the so-called \u201ccivic death\u201d of the times of King Edward III).\n18. The disqualification does not apply to persons imprisoned for contempt of court (section 3(2)a) or to those imprisoned only for default in, for example, paying a fine (section 3(2)c).\n19. During the passage through Parliament of the Representation of the People Act 2000, which permitted remand prisoners and unconvicted mental patients to vote, Mr Howarth MP, speaking for the Government, maintained the view that \u201cit should be part of a convicted prisoner\u2019s punishment that he loses rights and one of them is the right to vote\u201d. The Act was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, a statement that in introducing the measure in Parliament the Secretary of State considered its provisions to be compatible with the Convention.\n20. On 22 February 2001, the Secretary of State gave his reasons for maintaining the policy of disenfranchising convicted prisoners:\n\u201cBy committing offences which by themselves or taken with any aggravating circumstances including the offender\u2019s character and previous criminal record require a custodial sentence, such prisoners have forfeited the right to have a say in the way the country is governed for that period. There is more than one element to punishment than forcible detention. Removal from society means removal from the privileges of society, amongst which is the right to vote for one\u2019s representative.\u201d\n21. Section 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides:\n\u201c(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right.\n(2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.\u201d\n### III. RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL MATERIALS\n#### A. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d)\n22. Relevant provisions of the ICCPR provide:\nArticle 25\n\u201cEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 [race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status] and without unreasonable restrictions:\n(a) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives;\n(b) to vote...\u201d\nArticle 10\n1. All persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\n...\n3. The penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation.\u201d\n23. In the General Comment (No. 25(57)) adopted by the Human Rights Committee under Article 40(4) of the ICCPR dated 27 August 1996, the Committtee stated, inter alia, concerning the right guaranteed under Article 25:\n\u201c14. In their reports, State parties should indicate and explain the legislative provisions which would deprive citizens of their right to vote. The grounds for such deprivation should be objective and reasonable. If conviction for an offence is a basis for suspending the right to vote, the period of suspension should be proportionate to the offence and the sentence. Persons who are deprived of liberty but who have not been convicted should not be excluded from exercising the right to vote.\u201d\n#### B. European Prison Rules (1987, Recommendation R(87)3 Council of Europe)\n\u201c64. Imprisonment is by the deprivation of liberty a punishment in itself. The conditions of imprisonment and the prison regimes shall not, therefore, except as incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the suffering inherent in this.\u201d\n#### C. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters\n24. This document adopted by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) at its 51st Plenary Session (5-6 July 2002) and submitted to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 6 November 2002 includes the Commission\u2019s guidelines as to the circumstances in which there may be deprivation of the right to vote or to be elected:\n\u201cd. ...\ni. provision may be made for depriving individuals of their right to vote and to be elected, but only subject to the following cumulative conditions;\nii. it must be provided for by law;\niii. the proportionality principle must be observed; conditions for disenfranchising individuals of the right to stand for election may be less strict than for disenfranchising them;\niv. The deprivation must be based on mental incapacity or a criminal conviction for a serious offence.\nv. Furthermore, the withdrawal of political rights or finding of mental incapacity may only be imposed by express decision of a court of law.\u201d\n#### D. Sauv\u00e9 v. the Attorney General of Canada (No. 2)\n25. Following the decision of the Administrative Court in the present case, the Supreme Court of Canada on 31 October 2002 held by five votes to four that section 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act 1985, which denied the right to vote to every person imprisoned in a correctional institution serving a sentence of two years or more, was unconstitutional, i.e., infringing Articles 1 and 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:\n\u201c1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\u201d\n\u201c3. Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly and to be qualified for membership therein.\u201d\n26. The majority opinion given by McLachlin C.J. is summarised as follows in the headnote:\n\u201cTo justify the infringement of a Charter right under s. 1, the government must show that the infringement achieves a constitutionally valid purpose or objective, and that the chosen means are reasonable and demonstrably justified. The government\u2019s argument that denying the right to vote to penitentiary inmates requires deference because it is a matter of social and political philosophy is rejected. While deference may be appropriate on a decision involving competing social and political policies, it is not appropriate on a decision to limit fundamental rights. The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy and the rule of law and cannot be lightly set aside. Limits on it require not deference, but careful examination. The framers of the Charter signalled the special importance of this right not only by its broad, untrammelled language, but by exempting it from legislative override under s. 33\u2019s notwithstanding clause. The argument that the philosophically-based or symbolic nature of the objectives in itself commands deference is also rejected. Parliament cannot use lofty objectives to shield legislation from Charter scrutiny. Here, s. 51 (e) is not justified under s. 1 of the Charter.\nThe government has failed to identify particular problems that require denying the right to vote, making it hard to conclude that the denial is directed at a pressing and substantial purpose. In the absence of a specific problem, the government asserts two broad objectives for s. 51(e): (1) to enhance civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law; and (2) to provide additional punishment or \u2018enhance the general purposes of the criminal sanction\u2019. Vague and symbolic objectives, however, make the justification analysis difficult. The first objective could be asserted of virtually every criminal law and many non-criminal measures. Concerning the second objective, nothing in the record discloses precisely why Parliament felt that more punishment was required for this particular class of prisoner, or what additional objectives Parliament hoped to achieve by this punishment that were not accomplished by the sentences already imposed. Nevertheless, rather than dismissing the government\u2019s objectives outright, prudence suggests that we proceed to the proportionality inquiry.\nSection 51(e) does not meet the proportionality test. In particular, the government fails to establish a rational connection between s. 51(e)\u2019s denial of the right to vote and its stated objectives. With respect to the first objective of promoting civic responsibility and respect for the law, denying penitentiary inmates the right to vote is more likely to send messages that undermine respect for the law and democracy than messages that enhance those values. The legitimacy of the law and the obligation to obey the law flow directly from the right of every citizen to vote. To deny prisoners the right to vote is to lose an important means of teaching them democratic values and social responsibility. The government\u2019s novel political theory that would permit elected representatives to disenfranchise a segment of the population finds no place in a democracy built upon principles of inclusiveness, equality, and citizen participation. That not all self-proclaimed democracies adhere to this conclusion says little about what the Canadian vision of democracy embodied in the Charter permits. Moreover, the argument that only those who respect the law should participate in the political process cannot be accepted. Denial of the right to vote on the basis of attributed moral unworthiness is inconsistent with the respect for the dignity of every person that lies at the heart of Canadian democracy and the Charter. It also runs counter to the plain words of s. 3 of the Charter, its exclusion from the s. 33 override, and the idea that laws command obedience because they are made by those whose conduct they govern.\nWith respect to the second objective of imposing appropriate punishment, the government offered no credible theory about why it should be allowed to deny a fundamental democratic right as a form of state punishment. Denying the right to vote does not comply with the requirements for legitimate punishment - namely, that punishment must not be arbitrary and must serve a valid criminal law purpose. Absence of arbitrariness requires that punishment be tailored to the acts and circumstances of the individual offender. Section 51(e) qua punishment bears little relation to the offender\u2019s particular crime. As to a legitimate penal purpose, neither the record nor common sense supports the claim that disenfranchisement deters crime or rehabilitates criminals. By imposing a blanket punishment on all penitentiary inmates regardless of the particular crimes they committed, the harm they caused, or the normative character of their conduct, s. 51(e) does not meet the requirements of denunciatory, retributive punishment, and is not rationally connected to the government\u2019s stated goal.\nThe impugned provision does not minimally impair the right to vote. Section 51(e) is too broad, catching many people who, on the government\u2019s own theory, should not be caught. Section 51(e) cannot be saved by the mere fact that it is less restrictive than a blanket exclusion of all inmates from the franchise.\nLastly, the negative effects of denying citizens the right to vote would greatly outweigh the tenuous benefits that might ensue. Denying prisoners the right to vote imposes negative costs on prisoners and on the penal system. It removes a route to social development and undermines correctional law and policy directed towards rehabilitation and integration. In light of the disproportionate number of Aboriginal people in penitentiaries, the negative effects of s. 51(e) upon prisoners have a disproportionate impact on Canada\u2019s already disadvantaged Aboriginal population. ...\u201d\n27. The minority opinion given by Gonthier J. is summarised, in extract, as follows:\n\u201c...In this case, while it has been conceded that s. 51(e) of the Canada Elections Act infringes s. 3 of the Charter, the infringement is a reasonable limit that is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The objectives of s. 51(e) are pressing and substantial. Both objectives are based upon a reasonable and rational social or political philosophy. The first objective, that of enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, relates to the promotion of good citizenship. The social rejection of serious crime reflects a moral line which safeguards the social contract and the rule of law and bolsters the importance of the nexus between individuals and the community. The \u2018promotion of civic responsibility\u2019 may be abstract or symbolic, but symbolic or abstract purposes can be valid of their own accord and must not be downplayed simply for the reason of their being symbolic. The second objective is the enhancement of the general purposes of the criminal sanction. Section 51(e) clearly has a punitive aspect with a retributive function. It is a valid objective for Parliament to develop appropriate sanctions and punishments for serious crime. The disenfranchisement is a civil disability arising from the criminal conviction.\nSection 51(e) meets the proportionality tests. First, the impugned legislation is rationally connected to the objectives. While a causal relationship between disenfranchising prisoners and the objectives is not empirically demonstrable, reason, logic and common sense, as well as extensive expert evidence, support a conclusion that there is a rational connection between disenfranchising offenders incarcerated for serious crimes and the objectives of promoting civic responsibility and the rule of law and the enhancement of the general objectives of the penal sanction. ... Further, the disenfranchisement of serious criminal offenders serves to deliver a message to both the community and the offenders themselves that serious criminal activity will not be tolerated by the community. Society may choose to curtail temporarily the availability of the vote to serious criminals to insist that civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, as goals worthy of pursuit, are prerequisites to democratic participation. With respect to the second objective, the disenfranchisement is carefully tailored to apply to perpetrators of serious crimes, and there is evidence in the record indicating that the denial of the right to vote is perceived as meaningful by the prisoners themselves and can therefore contribute to the rehabilitation of prisoners. Lastly, many other democracies have, by virtue of choosing some form of prisoner disenfranchisement, also identified a connection between objectives similar to those advanced in the case at bar and the means of prisoner disenfranchisement.\nSecond, the impairment of the Charter right is minimal. ... Only \u2018serious offenders\u2019, as determined by Parliament, are subject to disenfranchisement. Since Parliament has drawn a two-year cut off line which identifies which incarcerated offenders have committed serious enough crimes to warrant being deprived of the vote, any alternative line will not be of equal effectiveness. ... The provision is reasonably tailored insofar as disenfranchisement reflects the length of the sentence and actual incarceration, which, in turn, reflect the seriousness of the crime perpetrated and the intended progress towards the ultimate goals of rehabilitation and reintegration. Section 51(e) is not arbitrary: it is related directly to particular categories of conduct. The two-year cut off line also reflects several practical considerations. Further, since this Court gave the impression that it was up to a Parliament to do exactly this after the first Sauv\u00e9 case..., there is a need for deference to Parliament in its drawing of a line. The analysis of social and political philosophies and the accommodation of values in the context of the Charter must be sensitive to the fact that there may be many possible reasonable and rational balances. Line drawing, amongst a range of acceptable alternatives, is for Parliament, ...\nThird, when the objective and the salutary effects are viewed in the totality of the context, they outweigh the temporary disenfranchisement of the serious criminal offender. The enactment of the measure is itself a salutary effect. The legislation intrinsically expresses societal values in relation to serious criminal behaviour and the right to vote in our society. Value emerges from the signal or message that those who commit serious crimes will temporarily lose one aspect of the political equality of citizens. Furthermore, the temporary disenfranchisement is perceived as meaningful by the offenders themselves and could have an ongoing positive rehabilitative effect. ... The statistical data mentioned by the Federal Court of Appeal indicate that the provision catches serious and repeat offenders and that most prisoners will only be deprived of participation in one election. Because the duration of the disenfranchisement is directly related to the duration of incarceration, a serious criminal offender may never actually be denied the opportunity to vote if there is no election during the time he is incarcerated. In light of the special context of this case - that the justification advanced by Parliament is rooted in a social or political philosophy that is not susceptible to proof in the traditional sense - deference is appropriate since the impugned provision raises questions of penal philosophy and policy. ...\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1\n28. The applicant complains that he has been disenfranchised, invoking Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 which provides:\n\u201cThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\u201d\n#### A. The parties\u2019 submissions\n##### 1. The applicant\n29. The applicant submitted that the right to vote was one of the most fundamental rights which underpinned a truly democratic society. It was not a privilege, contrary to the view expressed by the Secretary of State in February 2001. The restriction in voting rights, which did not apply to unconvicted prisoners, did not pursue any legitimate aim. Little thought had in fact been given to the disenfranchisement of prisoners at all by the legislature, the 1983 Act being a consolidating act adopted without debate on the point.\n30. The reason given by the Government was that the disenfranchisement of a convicted prisoner was considered as part of his punishment and that it aimed to enhance civic responsibility. The applicant however disputed that punishment could legitimately remove fundamental rights other than the deprivation of liberty and argued that this was inconsistent with the stated rehabilitative aim of prison. There was not any evidence that the ban pursued the purported aims nor any link shown between the removal of the vote and the prevention of crime or respect for the rule of law. Most courts and citizens were totally unaware that loss of voting rights accompanied the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. Indeed the applicant argued that the ban took away civic responsibility and eroded respect for the rule of law, serving to alienate prisoners further from society.\n31. The blanket ban was also disproportionate, arbitrary and impaired the essence of the right. It was unrelated to the nature or seriousness of the offence and varied in its effects on prisoners depending on whether their imprisonment coincided with an election. It potentially deprived a significant proportion of the population (some 74,000) of a voice or the possibility of challenging, electorally, the penal policy which affected them. In addition, the applicant submitted that, as a post-tariff prisoner, the punishment element of his sentence had expired and he was held on grounds of risk in which case no alleged justification of punishment could remain either. He referred to a trend in Canada (with particular emphasis on the decision of the Supreme Court in Sauv\u00e9 No. 2 holding to be unconstitutional a bar imposed on prisoners sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment or more), South Africa and other European states to enfranchise prisoners, claiming that 19 countries operated no ban while eight had a partial or specific ban. He concluded that there was no convincing reason, beyond punishment, to remove the vote from convicted prisoners and that this additional sanction was not in keeping with the idea that the punishment of imprisonment was the deprivation of liberty and that the prisoner did not thereby forfeit any other of his fundamental rights save in so far as this was necessitated by considerations of security etc.\n##### 2. The Government\n32. The Government submitted that under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 the right to vote was not absolute and that a wide margin of appreciation was to be allowed to Contracting States in determining the conditions under which the right to vote was exercised. A wide margin should be accorded as the decision to impose limits was that of the legislature which deserved to be given particular weight and as an extensive variation in practice existed between Contracting States in relation to convicted prisoners \u2013 some 18 countries imposed no restriction, 13 prohibited all prisoners from voting, with some restrictions imposable in another 12. A variety of approaches was also taken by democratic states outside Europe. Insofar as the applicant relied on the Canadian case, Sauv\u00e9 No. 2, they pointed out that it was a narrow decision by five votes to four, with a strong dissenting judgment referring to the diverse practice in Europe and that it concerned a differently framed domestic human rights instrument to which the margin of appreciation was not applicable.\n33. The Government stated that the policy has been adhered to over many years with the explicit approval of Parliament, most recently in the Representation of the People Act 2000, which was accompanied by a statement of compatibility under the Human Rights Act, indicating that the Secretary of State considered it to be compatible with the Convention. They argued that the disqualification in this case pursued the intertwined legitimate aims of preventing crime and punishing offenders and enhancing civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, by depriving those who have breached the basic rules of society of the right to have a say in the way such rules are made for the duration of their sentence. Convicted prisoners had breached the social contract and so could be regarded as (temporarily) forfeiting the right to take part in the government of the country. These aims were accepted as legitimate in the case-law of the Commission.\n34. The measure was also proportionate as it only affected those", "001-58086": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ANNE-MARIE ANDERSSON c.

Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court B0, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\nMr R. Ryssdal, President,\nMr B. Walsh,\nMr J. De Meyer,\nMrs E. Palm,\nMr A.N. Loizou,\nSir John Freeland,\nMr A.B. Baka,\nMr K. Jungwiert,\nMr J. Casadevall,\nand also of Mr H. Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 March and 25 June 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. The general principle of freedom of information\n14. Under sections 1 and 2 of chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act (Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen), which is part of the Swedish Constitution, everyone is entitled to access to public documents, subject to exceptions set out in the Secrecy Act (Sekretesslagen, 1980:100).\n#### B. Confidentiality of medical information\n15. One of the exceptions to this general rule relates to confidentiality of information in the field of health and medical care and is set out in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, which provides as follows:\n\u201cSecrecy applies ... in the field of health and medical care to information on the individual's state of health or otherwise concerning his or her private life, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any harm to the individual or persons closely related to him or her ...\u201d\n#### C. The duty to report to the Social Council\n16. Notwithstanding this rule of confidentiality, in certain circumstances health and medical-care authorities are required to submit information to another authority. Thus, chapter 14, section 1, of the Secrecy Act provides the following:\n\u201cSecrecy does not prevent ... the disclosure of information to another authority, if an obligation to disclose the information is laid down in an act of law or a government ordinance.\u201d\n17. Such an obligation follows from section 71 of the Social Services Act 1980 (Socialtj\u00e4nstlagen, 1980:620), subsections 2 and 4 of which read as follows:\n\u201cAuthorities whose activities relate to children and young persons as well as other authorities within health and medical-care and social services are obliged immediately to report to the Social Council if, in the course of their activities, they receive information which may imply that an intervention by the Social Council is necessary for the protection of a minor. This also applies to the employees of such authorities and to physicians, teachers, nurses and midwives who are not so employed.\n...\nAuthorities, employees and practitioners referred to in subsection 2 are obliged to give the Social Council all information which may be of importance to an investigation of a minor's need of protection.\u201d\n18. At the time of the enactment of the Social Services Act, the Parliament's Standing Committee on Health and Welfare (Riksdagens socialutskott) stated that the reporting obligation was not limited to cases where it was clear that the Social Council would have to intervene. In addition, unconfirmed information or information which was difficult to assess should also be reported, if it implied that a child might be in need of support or assistance from the Council. In such cases it would be for the Council to investigate whether there was any factual basis for the information in question and whether there was a need for any particular measure (see the report of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, SoU 1979/80:44, p. 113).\n19. The obligation to report only concerns information which is of relevance to the Social Council's investigation. It does not extend to other information concerning the persons in question (see Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 132). It is for the reporting authority or practitioner to decide which information is covered by the reporting obligation.\n20. Information which is submitted to the Social Council is protected by the rule of confidentiality provided by chapter 7, section 4, of the Secrecy Act:\n\u201cSecrecy applies within the social services to information concerning the individual's private life, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any harm to the individual or persons closely related to him or her ...\u201d\n#### D. Remedies\n21. Under the Freedom of the Press Act and the Secrecy Act, there is a right to appeal against a decision not to grant access to public documents. There is, however, no such right in respect of decisions to grant access to information contained in public documents. Furthermore, there is no right for the individual concerned to be consulted before such information is disclosed or to be notified of the disclosure afterwards.\n22. Under chapter 20, section 3, of the Penal Code (Brottsbalken), a physician who, intentionally or through negligence, discloses information which should be kept confidential according to law is guilty of breach of professional secrecy. Proceedings may be brought in the ordinary courts by the public prosecutor or, if the public prosecutor decides not to prosecute, the aggrieved individual. Such a breach of professional secrecy may also constitute a basis for claiming damages under chapter 2, section 1, or chapter 3, section 1, of the Damage Compensation Act (Skadest\u00e5ndslagen, 1972:207). Action may be taken by the individual against the physician or his or her employer.\n23. Public authorities and their employees are, furthermore, subject to the supervision of the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern) and the Parliamentary Ombudsman (Justitieombudsmannen). The Chancellor and the Ombudsman investigate whether those exercising public powers abide by laws and follow applicable instructions and may prosecute a certain individual or refer the matter to disciplinary action by the relevant authority.\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n24. Mrs Anne-Marie Andersson lodged her application (no. 20022/92) with the Commission on 11 February 1992. She alleged that the psychiatrist's submission of information to the Social Council without her knowledge or consent constituted a violation of her right to respect for private life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. Moreover, she complained that, contrary to Articles 6 and 13, she could not appeal to a court against the psychiatrist's decision to disclose the information.\n25. On 22 May 1995 the Commission declared admissible the applicant's complaints under Articles 6 and 13 and declared the remainder of her application inadmissible. In its report of 11 April 1996 (Article 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (unanimously) and that no separate issue arose under Article 13 of the Convention (twenty votes to seven).\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n26. At the hearing on 18 March 1997 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the Convention in the present case. In the meantime, after learning of the applicant's death and of the fact that her son, Mr Stive Andersson, wished to continue the proceedings on her behalf, the Government objected to his being allowed to do so (see paragraph 6 above).\n27. In her memorial to the Court the applicant's lawyer alleged that there had been violations of Articles 6, 8 and 13 and requested it to make an award of just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention. At the hearing she reiterated her claim that there had been violations of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS\n28. In the Government's submission, those of the applicant's complaints which had been declared admissible by the Commission and which had been referred to the Court were so closely and directly bound up with her person that her son, Mr Stive Andersson, could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable him to continue the proceedings in her stead. Nor did he have any definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention. For these reasons, the Government contested the right of the son to continue before the Court the proceedings which his mother had instituted.\n29. The Court observes that, in so far as declared admissible by the Commission, the applicant's case concerns her complaints under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention about lack of remedies to challenge the disclosure of certain confidential medical data by one public authority to another. In view of its own case-law (see, for instance, the X v. France judgment of 31 March 1992, Series A no. 234-C, p. 89, \u00a7 26), the Court accepts that, as the deceased's heir, the son has sufficient interest to justify the continuation of the examination of the case.\n30. On the other hand, the applicant's complaint that the disclosure of data in question amounted to a violation of Article 8 was declared inadmissible by the Commission (see paragraph 25 above). The Court has therefore no jurisdiction to entertain it under that provision (see, amongst other authorities, the Z v. Finland judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, p. 341, \u00a7 69).\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n31. The applicant contended that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, in so far as is relevant, reads:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by [a] \u2026 tribunal ...\u201d\nUnder this provision, she complained that she had not been afforded a possibility, prior to the communication of the psychiatrist's statement to the Social Council, to challenge the measure before a court (see paragraph 21 above).\n32. The Government disputed that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable and maintained that, in any event, it had been complied with in the present case (see paragraphs 22\u201323 above). The Commission, for its part, considered that the provision was applicable and that its requirements had been met (see paragraph 22 above).\n33. The Court must first examine whether Article 6 \u00a7 1 was applicable to the disagreement between the applicant and the Swedish authorities as to the disclosure of her medical data. It reiterates that, according to the principles laid down in its case-law (see, for instance, the judgments of Zander v. Sweden, 25 November 1993, Series A no. 279-B, p. 38, \u00a7 22, and Keroj\u00e4rvi v. Finland, 19 July 1995, Series A no. 322, p. 12, \u00a7 32), it must ascertain whether there was a dispute (\u201ccontestation\u201d) over a \u201cright\u201d which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law. The dispute must be genuine and serious; it may relate not only to the existence of a right but also to its scope and the manner of its exercise; and the outcome of the proceedings must be directly decisive for the right in question. Finally, the right must be civil in character.\n34. Under the rule on confidentiality contained in chapter 7, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, a duty of confidentiality applied to the kind of data in issue in the present case (see paragraph 15 above). The provision was evidently designed to protect a patient's interests in non-disclosure of medical data.\n35. On the other hand, according to chapter 14, section 1, of the Secrecy Act, the rule of confidentiality did not apply where a statutory obligation required the disclosure of information to another authority (see paragraph 16 above). In the case under consideration, if the chief psychiatrist possessed information about the applicant patient to the effect that intervention by the Social Council was necessary for the protection of her under-age son, the psychiatrist was under a duty to report immediately to the Social Council. That duty extended to all data in her possession which", "001-60309": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF DEVENNEY v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 February 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. By virtue of Section 17 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 (\u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a person on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to employment in Northern Ireland, inter alia, by dismissing him or subjecting him to any other detriment. By virtue of section 24 of the 1976 Act as amended, a complaint of unlawful discrimination may be presented to the Fair Employment Tribunal, which is established by statute to investigate complaints of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.\n18. Section 42 of the 1976 Act provides as follows:\n\u201c(1) The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order.\n(2) A certificate signed by, or on behalf of the Secretary of State and certifying that an act specified in the certificate was done for the purpose mentioned in sub-section (1) shall be conclusive evidence that it was done for that purpose.\n(3) A document purporting to be a document such as is mentioned in sub\u2011section (2) shall be received in evidence and, unless the contrary is proved, shall be deemed to be such a certificate.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n19. The applicant complained that the issue of the section 42 certificate deprived him of access to the tribunal to which he was entitled. In consequence of this alleged denial of access to a tribunal or court, the applicant claimed a violation of his rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides as relevant:\n\u201c1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal...\u201d\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n20. The Court notes that the 1976 Act guaranteed persons a right not to be discriminated against on grounds of religious belief or political opinion in relation to their employment, inter alia, by dismissing them or subjecting them to any other detriment. The Fair Employment Tribunal is empowered to assess individuals\u2019 financial loss if they are so discriminated against and award compensation when appropriate. Accordingly, the applicant\u2019s pecuniary rights were affected by being denied access to the Fair Employment Tribunal.\n21. The operation of section 42(1), which states that the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order, does not define the scope of the substantive right in limine but provides a respondent with a defence to a complaint of unlawful discrimination (cf. the Powell and Rayner v the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, \u00a7\u00a7 34-36). Accordingly the Court considers that the applicant has a clearly defined statutory right which, having regard to the context in which it applied and its pecuniary nature, can be classified as a \u201ccivil right\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1. The Court refers to its reasoning in its judgment of 10 July 1998 in the case of Tinnelly and Sons Limited and Others and McElduff and Others v the United Kingdom (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV, p. 1643).\n22. Accordingly the Court concludes that the present case concerns the applicant\u2019s civil rights and that Article 6 \u00a7 1 is applicable.\n#### B. Compliance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention\n23. The Court recalls that Article 6 \u00a7 1 embodies the \u201cright to a court\u201d, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect. However, this right is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention\u2019s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied, do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way, or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 \u00a7 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see among other authorities, Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1996, Reports 1996-IV, p.1502, \u00a7 50).\n24. It is against this background of principles that the Court must consider the present case.\n25. The Court notes that the fact that the certificate issued by the Secretary of State constituted under section 42 of the 1976 Act conclusive proof that the dismissal of the applicant was carried out for the purpose of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order meant that there could be no independent scrutiny whatsoever either as to the basis for the issue of such a certificate or as to whether the applicant was justified in his claim that he was dismissed on grounds of religious or political belief. In its decision of 5 January 1995, the Fair Employment Tribunal found that due to the existence of the section 42 certificate the Fair Employment Act did not apply to the termination of the applicant\u2019s employment and that accordingly there was nothing remaining for it to consider.\n26. The Court accepts that the protection of national security is a legitimate aim which may entail limitations on the right of access to a court, including withholding information for the purposes of security. As in the Tinnelly case therefore, it is necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the concerns for the protection of national security invoked by the authorities and the impact which the means they employed to this end had on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a court or tribunal.\n27. The Court is mindful of security considerations regarding employees in public buildings, such as hotels, in the centre of town, particularly if frequented by military or police personnel. As against this, the dismissal had an imm", "001-79071": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF LILJA v.

It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Lilja v. Sweden,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\nMr J.-P. Costa, President,\nMr A.B.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 4 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government left it to the Court to decide whether the relevant proceedings had been concluded within a reasonable time.\n20. The period to be taken into consideration in respect of the criminal proceedings began on 21 October 1996 and ended on 19 March 2004. It thus lasted seven years and five months for one level of jurisdiction. The corresponding period concerning the tax proceedings began on 5 December 1997 and ended on 2 October 2003 and thus lasted five years and ten months for three levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n21. The Government questioned whether the applicant could be considered a victim in so far as his complaint concerned the tax proceedings. They referred to the fact that the relevant taxes, contributions and surcharges had been levied not on the applicant himself but on his company and that, similarly, the company had been the party to the proceedings.\n22. The Government further submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him since he had not sued the Swedish State for damages on account of the length of the proceedings. They relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court (H\u00f6gsta domstolen), pronounced on 9 June 2005, where a plaintiff had been granted compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage because of a breach of the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in a criminal case. Thus, according to the Government, the applicant could have tried this avenue before complaining to the Court or, in any event, should now do so.\n23. The Court first observes that the company Latem AB was wholly owned by the applicant and that the criminal and tax proceedings were related, as they were both based on the submission of incorrect tax declarations. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the applicant may claim to be a victim of the length of the tax proceedings and that, in the examination of his complaint, the two sets of proceedings are to be considered together. In this connection, it reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 1, under its criminal head, is applicable to the tax proceedings, in so far as they concerned tax surcharges (see, among other authorities, Janosevic v. Sweden, no. 34619/97, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2002-VII).\nThe Court further notes that the judgment of the Supreme Court referred to by the Government was pronounced on 9 June 2005, i.e. almost three years after the applicant lodged the present application with the Court and about one year and three months after his acquittal by the District Court acquired legal force. Thus, the Court considers that the applicant cannot now be required to lodge a compensation claim before the national courts, nor could he have been expected to have done so in March 2004 since, at that time, there were no indications that it would have been an effective remedy. In this respect, the Court notes that the applicant, during the proceedings before the District Court, did complain to the Chancellor of Justice that the proceedings were taking too long.\n24. The Government\u2019s objections must accordingly be dismissed. The Court further notes that the applicant\u2019s complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It also finds that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n25. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and that of the relevant authorities (see, among many other authorities, P\u00e9lissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, \u00a7 67, ECHR 1999-II).\n26. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see P\u00e9lissier and Sassi, cited above).\n27. The Government claimed that both the criminal and the tax proceedings had concerned matters of some complexity and had involved extensive investigations regarding many different suspects and companies. In regard to the criminal case, they emphasised that the appli", "001-60737": "\ufeff\nFOURTH SECTION\nCASE OF D\u00d6RY v.

O\u2019Boyle, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 October 2002,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n#### A. Industrial injury insurance\n25. All gainfully employed persons working in Sweden are insured against industrial injuries in accordance with the 1976 Act. Anyone who is put on the sick-list as a result of an industrial injury and who is insured under the 1962 Act is entitled to the same per diem benefit from the ordinary sickness insurance (social insurance) during the first 90 days as if he or she had been sick for a reason other than an industrial injury. When 90 days have passed, the insured person is entitled to a per diem sickness benefit in accordance with the 1976 Act (industrial injury insurance), if his or her ability to carry on with gainful employment is reduced by at least 25% (50% prior to 1 July 1990). After the period of sickness has come to an end and the insured person is no longer on the sick-list, he or she is entitled to a life annuity if the capacity for gainful employment is reduced by at least one fifteenth.\n#### B. Social insurance\n26. All Swedish nationals and other residents in Sweden are insured in accordance with the 1962 Act. Anyone who is registered with the Social Insurance Office and has an annual income of at least 6,000 Swedish kronor (SEK) has the right to a per diem sickness benefit, if his or her sickness reduces the ability to work by at least 25%.\n#### C. Procedure\n27. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 and 1976 Acts may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and, at the relevant time, subject to leave to appeal being granted, to the Supreme Social Insurance Court. The latter court was the final instance in social insurance matters until 1 July 1995, when it was abolished and its tasks taken over by the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsr\u00e4tten).\n28. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. It also regulated the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court. Section 9 provides:\n\u201cThe proceedings are in writing.\nAn oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.\nIn the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.\u201d\nThe possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances was not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Social Insurance Court.\n29. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).\n30. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party\u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).\nTHE LAW\n31. The applicant complained that the lack of an oral hearing before the courts had constituted a violation of her rights under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The Government\n32. The Government questioned whether it had not been justified to dispense with oral hearings in the applicant\u2019s cases. They contended that such hearings would not have added anything to the proceedings and that the issues involved had been adequately resolved on the basis of the case files and the applicant\u2019s written observations. In this respect, they pointed out that the applicant had not invoked any oral evidence and that the judges, possessing no medical expertise, could not have made their own assessment of the applicant\u2019s capacity to work by meeting her in person but had had to rely on written medical evidence. Moreover, the applicant had been assisted by counsel apparently familiar with the subject-matter and thus could not be considered to have had difficulties in arguing her cases in writing. Also, as the cases had concerned the applicant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under certain social-insurance schemes, no questions of public interest had been involved. In any event, considering the issues involved and the personal nature of the cases, an oral hearing would have been held in camera.\n33. The Government also pointed out that the Administrative Court of Appeal had found it unnecessary to hold oral hearings and that its decisions on this matter had been fully in line with domestic law. Furthermore, they maintained that, as the applicant had not requested the County Administrative Court to hold oral hearings, she had, at least tacitly, waived her right to have her cases heard in public before that judicial instance. In addition, some of the applicant\u2019s requests for oral hearings had been made without stating any reasons.\n##### 2. The applicant\n34. The applicant submitted that an oral hearing could be dispensed with only if the person concerned had explicitly waived the right thereto and there were exceptional circumstances which justified not holding a hearing. She claimed that an oral hearing had been indispensable in her cases, as the investigation made by the Office had been inadequate and had led to erroneous assessments and the information available to the courts thus had been insufficient. It is true that she did not propose that any witnesses or experts be heard. However, an oral hearing would have given her the opportunity to describe her medical problems and resulting difficulties in resuming her work. Also, she would have been able to show, for example, how much her income had decreased due to her industrial injury.\n35.

Early, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 May 2006,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: THE LAW\n### I. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n12. See the Court\u2019s judgment in Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 5394/97, ECHR 2000\u2011V, and also Taylor-Sabori v. the United Kingdom, no. 47114/99, 22 October 2002, and Hewitson v. the United Kingdom, no. 50015/99, 27 May 2003.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n13. The applicant complained under Article 6 of the Convention that he had been deprived of a fair trial. Article 6, in so far as it is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing...\u201d\nThe applicant alleged that his trial had been rendered unfair by the use of the covert recording device and also by the acts of participating informants. The applicant claimed that, after his trial and conviction, but before the appeal proceedings, an informant made a statement to his solicitor which indicated that the recording device was installed as a result of information given to the police and that the police encouraged the informant to channel his conversations with the applicant in such a way as to elicit incriminating admissions.\n14. The Government made no submissions under Article 6.\n15. The Court considers that the applicant has failed to substantiate his complaint about the involvement of a participating informant in the investigation and it notes that that the Court of Appeal found no evidence to support the allegation of entrapment. In the Khan judgment it found that the use at the applicant\u2019s trial of secretly taped material did not conflict with the requirements of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, and it finds the present case indistinguishable on this point.\n16. It follows that the complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 is manifestly ill-founded and inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention.\n### III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained under Article 8 about the use of participating informants, and also about the use of covert listening devices to obtain material which was subsequently relied on by the prosecution. Article 8, in so far as it is relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private...life...and his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n18. The Government accepted that there had been a violation of Article 8 in so far as the Home Office Guidelines at the relevant time were not legally binding or publicly accessible.\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Court observes that the complaint relating to participating informants is inadmissible for the same reasons as the linked complaint under Article 6. The remainder of the complaint under Article 8, concerning the use of a covert listening device, is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention or inadmissible on any other ground. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n20.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained that the length of her detention both in police custody and on remand exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cEveryone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n19. The Government maintained under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that the application must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies or, alternatively, for failure to comply with the six-month rule. Under the first limb of their objections, the Government pointed out that the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still pending. As regards the second limb of their objections, the Government argued, firstly, that the applicant should have lodged her complaint regarding the length of her detention in police custody within six months following the date on which she was remanded in custody, i.e. on 1 October 1993. Secondly, they suggested that the applicant should have lodged her complaint pertaining to the length of her remand in custody within six months following the date on which the District Court ruled on the applicant's request for release, i.e. on 20 November 2000.\n20. The applicant disputed the Government's arguments.\n21. As regards the complaint concerning the length of the applicant's remand in custody, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government's similar objections regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies in previous cases (see, in particular, Tutar v. Turkey, no. 11798/03, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14, 10 October 2006). It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned applications. In so far as the Government suggest that the applicant had failed to comply with the six months rule, the Court recalls that if an applicant submits her complaints to the Court while she is still in detention, the case cannot be dismissed as being out of time (see, in particular, Je\u010dius v. Lithuania, no. 34578/97, \u00a7 44, ECHR 2000-IX). In the instant case, the applicant was still in detention when she lodged her complaint before this Court. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government's objections under this head.\n22. Moreover, the Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill\u2011founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n23. As to the complaint relating to the length of the applicant's detention in police custody, the Court reiterates that, according to the established case-law of the Convention organs, where there is no domestic remedy available, the six\u2011month period runs from the date of the act alleged to constitute a violation of the Convention; however, where it concerns a continuing situation, the period of six months runs from the end of the situation concerned (see, among other authorities, Ege v. Turkey (dec.), no. 47117/99, 10 February 2004).\n24. The Court notes that the applicant's detention in police custody ended when she was detained on remand on 1 October 1993, whereas this complaint was lodged with the Court on 12 November 2002, i.e. more than six months later. In these circumstances, the Court accepts the Government's objection that the applicant has failed to comply with the six\u2011month rule. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n#### B. Merits\n25. The Government contended that the domestic authorities displayed diligence when considering the applicant's requests for release pending trial. Moreover, they claimed that the seriousness of the crime and the special circumstances of the case justified her continued detention on remand.\n26. The applicant maintained her allegations.\n27. The Court reiterates that it falls in the first place to the domestic judicial authorities to ensure that, in a given case, the detention of an accused person pending trial does not exceed a reasonable time. To this end they must examine all the facts arguing for or against the existence of a genuine requirement of public interest justifying, with due regard to the principle of presumption of innocence, a departure from the rule of respect for individual liberty, and set them out in their decisions on the applications for release. It is primarily on the basis of the reasons given in these decisions, and of the established facts mentioned by the applicants in their appeals, that the Court must determine whether or not there has been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention (see Sevgin and \u0130nce v. Turkey, no. 46262/99, \u00a7 61, 20 September 2005).\n28. The persistence of a reasonable suspicion that the person arrested has committed an offence is a sine qua non for the validity of the continued detention, but after a certain lapse of time, it no longer suffices; the Court must then establish whether the other grounds cited by the judicial authorities continued to justify the deprivation of liberty (see, among other authorities, Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, \u00a7 77, 26 July 2001, and Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, \u00a7\u00a7 152-153, ECHR 2000-IV).\n29. In the instant case, the Court notes that there were two periods of pre-trial detention. The first period began on 17 September 1993 with the applicant's arrest and ended on 17 December 2003, the date of the judgment of the \u0130stanbul Assize Court. From that point on, and until the Court of Cassation's decision of 1 April 2005, the applicant was detained \u201cafter conviction by a competent court\u201d, which falls within the scope of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Convention. The second period began on 1 April 2005 and ended on 21 December 2005 when the applicant was released pending trial. It has therefore lasted around eleven years in total (see, in particular, Solmaz v. Turkey, no. 27561/02, \u00a7\u00a7 23-36, 16 January 2007).

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 3 April 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date: ### II. THE RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\n15. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the \u00c7obano\u011flu and Budak judgment v. Turkey, (no. 45977/99, \u00a7\u00a7 29\u201130, 30 January 2007).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ADMISSIBILITY\n16. The Government asked the Court to dismiss the application for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. In this regard, the Government maintained that the applicants failed to object to their continued remand in detention pursuant to Article 298 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP). They further submitted that the applicants failed to raise the substance of the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts.\n17. The applicants did not specifically deal with the Government's objections under this head.\n18. As regards the first limb of the Government's objection, the Court reiterates that under the terms of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention it can only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law. However, only available and adequate remedies must be tried under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. There is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, among others, Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v. Turkey, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 64, 27 June 2006).\n19. The Court recalls that, in the area of exhaustion of domestic remedies, the burden of proof is on the Government claiming non\u2011exhaustion to indicate to the Court with sufficient clarity the remedy to which the applicants have not had recourse and to satisfy the Court that this remedy was effective and available in theory and in practice at the relevant time, that is to say that it was accessible, was capable of providing redress in respect of the applicants' complaints and offered reasonable prospects of success (see Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan, cited above, \u00a7 65). Furthermore, the Court notes that the application of the rule of exhaustion must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to establish. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism (see Acunbay v. Turkey, nos. 61442/00 and 61445/00, \u00a7 45, 31 May 2005).\n20. In the instant case the Court notes that the trial court examined the applicants' detention on remand at the end of each hearing, either of its own motion or upon the request of the applicants. It therefore had the opportunity to end the applicants' alleged lengthy detention and to avoid or to redress an alleged breach of the Convention (see Acunbay, cited above, \u00a7 48, and Tamer and Others v. Turkey, no. 235/02, \u00a7 28, 22 June 2006).\n21. The Court further notes that, pursuant to Article 298 of the CCP (since repealed), the applicants could have objected to their continued remand in custody as indicated by the Government. However, the Court cannot agree with the Government that this remedy was effective and offered reasonable prospects of success in practice for the following reasons.\n22. The Court has examined several cases against Turkey in which it has found a violation of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention based on the fact that, inter alia, the State Security Courts used the same formal reasons for the applicants' continued detention without explaining their specific relevance in each case (see, for example, Hasan Ceylan v. Turkey, no. 58398/00, 23 May 2006, Pakkan v. Turkey, no. 13017/02, 31 October 2006, G\u0131yasettin Altun v. Turkey, no. 73038/01, 24 May 2005, Tutar v. Turkey, no. 11798/03, 10 October 2006, Mehmet G\u00fcne\u015f v. Turkey, no. 61908/00, 21 September 2006, Acunbay, cited above, and Tamer and Others, cited above). It considers that, in these circumstances, an objection against such stereotype reasoning would have had little prospect of success before another instance. Moreover, as a rule, the objection proceedings in question are not adversarial and are decided in the absence of an oral hearing (Article 302 \u00a7 1 of the CCP). They therefore lack the guarantees appropriate to the kind of deprivation of liberty in question (see, for example, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II, and Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VIII, p. 3302, \u00a7 162).\n23. The Court notes that there is a distinction between the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 and the requirements of Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention aimed at providing safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of liberty. However, where its consistent case-law shows that such safeguards fail or are deficient, it would be contrary to the very principle of the Convention and would lead to excessive formalism under Article 35 \u00a7 1 to demand of the applicant the pursuit of inadequate safeguards.\n24. Furthermore, the Court notes that the Government's submissions in the instant case remain very general, only citing the relevant provisions in the law. The Court reiterates that it is not for the Convention bodies to cure of their own motion any shortcomings or lack of precision in the respondent Government's arguments (see, in particular, Stran Greek Refineries and Stratis Andreadis v. Greece, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-B, p. 77, \u00a7 35). In the light of the above, the Court rejects the Government's objection under this head.\n25. As to whether the applicants had failed to complain about the length of the proceedings before the domestic courts, the Court reiterates that it has already examined and rejected the Government's preliminary objections in similar cases (see, in particular, Mete v. Turkey, no. 39327/02, \u00a7\u00a7 18-19, 25 October 2005). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above\u2011mentioned application. It therefore also rejects this aspect of the Government's objection.\n26. The Court considers that the application raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. It concludes therefore that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\n### II. ALLEGED VI", "001-58095": "\ufeff\nAFFAIRE ROBINS c. ROYAUME-UNI\nCASE OF ROBINS v.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 June and 1 September 1997,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. Relevant domestic law and practice\n#### A. Legal aid\n18. Legal aid is available to litigants in the English courts subject to various requirements as to means and the merits of the case in question. Financial assessments of a litigant\u2019s disposable income and capital are carried out by specialist staff of the Benefits Agency\u2019s Legal Aid Assessment Office. The resources of the litigant\u2019s spouse are treated as belonging to the litigant unless they are living \u201cseparate and apart\u201d (see the Civil Legal Aid (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1989 (Statutory Instrument 1989 no. 338), Regulations 4 and 7).\n#### B. Assessment of costs against a legally aided litigant\n19. In the English courts, the award of costs generally (in all cases, including those where one or more parties are legally aided) is a matter for the discretion of the court (see the Supreme Court Act 1981, section 51). However, rules of court lay down certain principles which are normally applied in the exercise of this discretion, including the principle that the\nunsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party (see the Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 62, Rule 3, and the County Court Rules, Order 38, Rule 1 (3)).\n20. This principle is not affected by the fact that an unsuccessful litigant is legally aided. However, after an order for costs has been made against such a person, the court which tried or heard the proceedings must determine how much of these costs it would be reasonable for the legally aided litigant to pay, in accordance with section 17 (1) of the Legal Aid Act 1988, which provides:\n\u201cThe liability of a legally assisted party under an order for costs made against him with respect to any proceedings shall not exceed the amount (if any) which is a reasonable one for him to pay having regard to all the circumstances, including the financial resources of all the parties and their conduct in connection with the dispute.\u201d\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n21. In their application to the Commission of 14 March 1993 (no. 22410/93) Mr and Mrs Robins made a number of complaints under Articles 6, 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention concerning the substantive proceedings relating to their dispute with their neighbours; in addition, they complained under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the length of the costs proceedings.\n22. On 22 February 1995, the Commission declared inadmissible the complaints concerning the substantive proceedings. The complaint concerning the costs proceedings was declared admissible on 18 January 1996. In its report of 4 July 1996 (Article 31), it expressed the opinion, by sixteen votes to nine, that there had been no violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because the proceedings did not fall within the scope of that provision. The full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the three dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n23. The Government in their memorial asked the Court to find that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention was not applicable to the proceedings in question or, in the alternative, that there had been no violation of that provision.\nThe applicants asked the Court to find a violation and to award them compensation under Article 50 of the Convention.\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24. The applicants contended that the costs proceedings were not concluded within a reasonable time, contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a \u2026 hearing within a reasonable time by [a] \u2026 tribunal ...\u201d\nThe Government and the Commission were both of the opinion that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was not applicable.\n#### A. Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n25. The applicants disputed that Judge Clarke had made an order for costs on 1 May 1991; in their view the proceedings were therefore both for the determination of their basic liability to pay costs and the assessment of the amount of their contribution. They submitted that these proceedings fell within the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention because they could not be divorced from the substantive proceedings, which undoubtedly involved \u201cthe determination of ... civil rights and obligations\u201d. Furthermore, they reminded the Court that the sums of money at stake were substantial and that they were finally ordered to pay a contribution in excess of 10,000 pounds sterling (GBP).\n26. The Government contended that Judge Clarke had ordered that the applicants pay Mr and Mrs T.\u2019s costs on 1 May 1991. The proceedings in question did not, therefore, concern a determination of the substantive rights of the parties to the litigation or of the liability of Mr and Mrs Robins to pay their neighbours\u2019 costs; they were instead concerned with an investigation by the court under section 17 of the 1988 Act into the applicants\u2019 financial circumstances and the assessment of any contribution which it was reasonable for them to pay (see paragraph 20 above). This investigation fell within the scope of public law and did not concern \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n27. The Commission in its report found that the costs proceedings were not in any way linked to the substantive dispute between the applicants and their neighbours, since the dispute over costs arose after the substantive dispute had been resolved and had no relevance to it. It invoked its case-law to the effect that subsidiary proceed", "001-101231": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF KURKAEV v.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Domestic law and practice concerning asylum procedures\n13. A description of the relevant domestic law and practice concerning asylum procedures may be found in the case of Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey (no. 30471/08, \u00a7\u00a7 29-44, 22 September 2009).\n#### B. Relevant CPT reports\n14. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2002)8 - Report concerning the CPT's visit to the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters (referred to as \u201cthe holding facility\u201d or \u201cdetention unit\u201d at \u201cIstanbul Police Headquarters\u201d) from 2-14 September 2001 are as follows:\n\u201c63. The holding facility at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was not overcrowded at the time of the visit (35 persons). Further, some limited renovation work (e.g. painting of walls) had been carried out shortly before the visit, and all the detainees had a bed and mattress. In addition, the ventilation system worked satisfactorily and the cell doors were unlocked, thereby enabling detainees to have ready access to the facilities in the corridor (e.g. drink dispenser, telephone, etc.) as well as to the sanitary facilities. However, in the same way as during the 1999 visit, it would appear that this relatively favourable state of affairs was atypical.\nConsultation of the relevant register indicated that the facility frequently accommodated between 100 and 200 persons; the space available is totally inadequate for such numbers. Further, despite denials from staff, it subsequently became clear that, due to pressure of numbers in early July, detained foreign nationals had also been placed in the basement-level holding areas in building B; conditions in those areas are totally unsuitable for periods of detention exceeding a few hours. In addition, the information gathered indicated that the provision of mattresses and blankets was a very recent development.\nIt should also be noted that cells and sanitary facilities were in a poor state of repair and cleanliness. Moreover, detainees were still not offered any form of occupational activities (e.g. reading material, toys for children, etc.), and the CPT was particularly concerned to learn that no progress had been made as regards offering outdoor exercise.\n64. At the end of the visit, the delegation called upon the Turkish authorities to attach a high priority to the implementation of already existing plans to extend the holding facility at the Foreigners' Department at Istanbul Police Headquarters. In their reply of 19 December 2001, the Turkish authorities informed the Committee of progress made in this respect.\u201d\n15. The relevant paragraphs of the CPT/Inf (2006)30 Report concerning CPT's visit from 7 to 14 December 2005 are as follows:\n\u201c35. As already indicated (cf. paragraph 9), the situation observed by the CPT's delegation in the detention unit for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters was the subject of an immediate observation under Article 8, paragraph 5, of the Convention. With a capacity \u2013 according to staff \u2013 of 90, the unit was holding more than double that figure (147 men and 43 women) on the day of the delegation's visit. The outrageous overcrowding and general sordidness of the conditions in the facility beggared belief, a state of affairs which is all the more serious in view of the fact that some of the detainees had been held there for more than six months.\nThe CPT first drew the Turkish authorities' attention to the unacceptable nature of the arrangements for immigration detainees at \u0130stanbul Police Headquarters as long ago as 1997, and has subsequently reemphasised this point, most recently in the report on the September 2001 visit (cf. CPT/Inf (2002) 8, paragraphs 62 to 66). Some minor improvements have been made over the years. However, the facts found during the December 2005 visit have highlighted once again the fundamental inadequacy of the existing detention unit; above all, it is too small.\n36. A solution to this long-standing problem might finally be in sight. By letter of 23 February 2006, the Turkish authorities confirmed that a much larger facility for this category of detainee, offering far better conditions, would be brought into service towards the end of 2006, once extensive renovation work at the site concerned (in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc District) had been completed.\nThe CPT calls upon the Turkish authorities to give a very high priority to the bringing into service of the above-mentioned facility; every attempt should be made to accelerate the completion of the ongoing renovation work.\nAs regards the material conditions and regime activities to be offered in the new facility and the staffing arrangements, the CPT recommends the Turkish authorities to take fully into account the standards set out in paragraph 29 of the 7th General Report on the CPT's activities (CPT/Inf (97)10).\n37. The entry into service of the new facility will in any event not occur for some months. In the meantime, steps must be taken to alleviate the intolerable situation in the existing detention unit for immigration detainees at Istanbul Police Headquarters.\nIn their letter of 23 February 2006, the Turkish authorities state that during the transitional period, immediate measures have been taken to improve conditions at the existing facility, including as regards sanitary conditions and the provision of food. The CPT would like to receive further details of the measures concerned.\nFor so long as the existing detention unit for immigration detainees remains in service, the Committee recommends that every effort be made so that the official capacity of the facility is not exceeded. Further, immediate steps must be taken to ensure that all detainees are offered outdoor exercise on a daily basis; the current situation, in which persons can spend weeks if not months without ever having access to the open air, is inadmissible.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 AND 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n16. Relying on Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention, the applicant complained that he had been unlawfully detained without the possibility of challenging the lawfulness of his detention. The Government contested these arguments.\n#### A. Admissibility\n17. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n18. The Government submitted that the applicant's detention was based on section 23 of Law no. 5683 and section 4 of Law no. 5682 and that he was being held pending deportation proceedings in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1 (f) of the Convention. The Government further submitted that a certain A.A., an Iranian who had entered Turkey illegally and who had been detained in the K\u0131rklareli Accommodation Centre, had successfully challenged his detention and possible deportation before the administrative courts. He was consequently given a temporary residence permit. Therefore, according to the Government, administrative proceedings constituted an effective remedy for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined the same grievances in the case of Abdolkhani and Karimnia (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 125\u2011135) and the Government's example of A.A. in the case of Tehrani and Others v. Turkey (nos. 32940/08, 41626/08 and 43616/08, \u00a7\u00a7 74\u201179, 13 April 2010). It found in the former case that the placement of the applicants in the K\u0131rklareli Accommodation Centre constituted a deprivation of liberty. The Court concluded that, in the absence of clear legal provisions establishing a procedure for ordering and extending detention with a view to deportation and setting time-limits for such detention, the deprivation of liberty to which the applicants had been subjected was not \u201clawful\u201d for the purposes of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The Court found in the latter case that the judicial review in the case of A.A. could not be regarded as a speedy reply to A.A.'s request; he had continued to be held in detention for another thirty days despite the court ruling regarding his release. It concluded that the Turkish legal system did not provide the applicants with a remedy whereby they could speedily obtain judicial review of the lawfulness of their detention within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.\n20. The Court has examined the present case and finds no particular circumstances which would require it to depart from its findings in the aforementioned Abdolkhani and Karimnia or Tehrani and Others judgments.\nThere has therefore been a violation of Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained about the conditions of detention at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters.\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Government contended that the applicant had not exhausted the criminal and administrative remedies available to him. The Government added that the application should be declared inadmissible for failure to comply with the six-month rule contained in Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. According to the Government the applicant should have introduced his complaint within six months of his release on 25 September 2004, had he considered the domestic proceedings to be ineffective. However he had lodged his complaint on 4 April 2005.\n23. The applicant reiterated his complaints. He maintained that the domestic remedies referred to by the Government were only available in theory and not effective in practice. In this connection he submitted a sample decision delivered by the Istanbul Administrative Court on 29 May 2006, in which the court rejected the objection of a certain O.\u0130., who had lodged a similar complaint about the conditions of detention at the Foreigners' Department of the Istanbul Security Headquarters, where he had been held for deportation purposes in September 2005. In line with the existing procedure, O.\u0130.'s complaint had been examined by the District Governorship, which had refused to start legal proceedings for lack of sufficient evidence.\n24. The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n17. Article 146 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Turkish Criminal Code provides:\n\u201cWhosoever shall attempt to alter or amend in whole or in part the Constitution of the Turkish Republic or to effect a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against the Grand National Assembly formed under the Constitution or to prevent it by force from carrying out its functions shall be liable to the death penalty.\n...\nAccomplices to the crime specified in paragraph one, other than those specified in paragraph two, shall be punished by heavy imprisonment for not less that fifteen years and be disqualified to hold public office for life.\u201d\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n18. The applicant complained about the length of the criminal proceedings against him. He alleged a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n19. The Government refuted the applicant\u2019s allegations. They argued that the case was complex on account of the nature of the charges the applicant faced and the need to organise a large-scale trial involving 723 defendants, including the applicant, all of whose involvement in Dev-Yol activities had to be established. They averred that these factors explained the length of the proceedings and that no negligence or delay could be imputed to the judicial authorities.\n#### A. Period to be taken into consideration\n20. The Court notes that the proceedings began on 1 December 1980, the date of the applicant\u2019s arrest, and are still pending before the Ankara Assize Court. They have thus already lasted more than twenty years.\n21. The Court\u2019s jurisdiction ratione temporis only permits it to consider the period of almost fourteen years and eight months that elapsed after 28 January 1987, the date of deposit of Turkey\u2019s declaration recognising the right of individual petition (see Canko\u00e7ak v. Turkey (Sect. 1), nos. 25182/94 and 26956/95, judgment of 20 February 2001, \u00a7 26). It must nevertheless take account of the state of the proceedings at the time when the aforementioned declaration was deposited (ibid., \u00a7 25). On the critical date the proceedings had already lasted six years.\n#### B. Reasonableness of the length of proceedings\n22. The Court observes that the Martial Law Court took almost eight years and seven months to reach a verdict. It took the Military Court of Cassation more than four years to rule on the appeal. Furthermore, the Court of Cassation gave judgment on 27 December 1995, approximately one year after it had been seized of the case.

Petzold, Acting Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 21 April and 21 September 1994,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Appeals in criminal proceedings\n15. The following details relate solely to the \u201csolemn procedure\u201c, under which trial proceeds upon an indictment before a judge sitting with a jury.\n16. A person convicted of a criminal charge in Scotland has an automatic right of appeal granted by statute (section 228 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 - \u201cthe 1975 Act\u201c). No leave to appeal is required.\n17. In an appeal, the appellant may ask the court to review any alleged miscarriage of justice in the proceedings in which he was convicted (section 228(2) of the 1975 Act). What is a miscarriage of justice is not defined by statute, but the term covers such matters as misdirections by the trial judge or wrong decisions on the admissibility of evidence, as well as breaches of natural justice. In any appeal, the nature of the alleged miscarriage of justice must be specified in the grounds of appeal contained in a written note of appeal, lodged within eight weeks of the date when sentence was imposed upon the appellant (section 233(1) and (2) of the 1975 Act). An appellant may not, at the appeal hearing, found any aspect of his appeal on a ground which is not contained in the note of appeal unless, exceptionally and on cause shown, he obtains the leave of the court to do so (section 233(3) of the 1975 Act).\n18. An appeal is heard by a bench of not less than three judges. At the hearing of the appeal the appellant or his counsel, if he is represented, makes submissions to the court in support of the grounds of appeal. Appellants who do not have legal representation are not required to make an oral presentation: they are allowed, however, to read any material that they may have prepared or collected.\nThe Crown is always represented by counsel at the hearing of criminal appeals. Their duty is to act solely in the public interest and not to seek to uphold a wrongful decision. Accordingly, they will only address the court if requested to do so or if it is necessary to bring to the attention of the court some matter relevant to the appeal, whether or not favourable to the prosecution.\n19. In disposing of an appeal against conviction the court may dismiss it and affirm the verdict of the trial court; set aside the verdict of the trial court either by quashing the conviction or by substituting an amended verdict of guilty; or set aside the verdict of the trial court and authorise a new prosecution (section 254 of the 1975 Act).\n#### B. Representation of appellants by counsel\n20. Counsel in Scotland are vested with the public office of advocate, which imposes a number of duties upon them, among which is the duty not to accept instructions to act in circumstances where, in their professional opinion, a case is manifestly unfounded, even if the client is able to pay for such representation.\nThe basis of this rule of professional conduct is that counsel cannot properly occupy the time of the court in advancing arguments which he knows to be without foundation.\n#### C. Legal aid for criminal appeals\n21. The administration of legal aid in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Legal Aid Board, an independent body whose members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland from among counsel, solicitors and other persons with experience of the courts.\n22. Legal aid which has been made available for a trial on indictment extends, in the case of conviction, to include consideration and advice by a solicitor on the question of appeal. An opinion on the prospect of the appeal can also be obtained from the counsel who acted at the trial.\nUnder special provisions legal aid is also available to enable the solicitor to prepare and lodge the statutory intimation of intention to appeal and, where appropriate, arrange for the opinion of counsel to be obtained as to the prospects of the appeal, and for the drafting and lodging of a note of appeal setting out the grounds of appeal.\n23. To extend the legal aid beyond this point a further application by the solicitor to the Legal Aid Board is required. This should include confirmation that the applicant\u2019s solicitor is willing to act in the appeal as well as a statement of the arguments in support of the grounds of appeal and a note of the solicitor\u2019s reasons for believing that the grounds of appeal are substantial and that legal aid should be made available.\nThe application will be granted if the Board is satisfied that the applicant is financially eligible, that \u201che has substantial grounds for making the appeal and it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be made available to him\u201c (Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986, section 25(2)).\n24. The Board takes its decisions on the basis of the documents before it, which normally include copies of the Note of Appeal, the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury and the trial judge\u2019s report on the case. The views expressed by the applicant\u2019s solicitor and counsel will also be taken into account.\n25. Although the legislation does not provide for a formal review, the Board will, as a matter of practice, when requested to do so, reconsider an application which has been refused. Such reconsideration involves the application being referred to an external reporter, who was not involved in the Board\u2019s earlier decision and who reports to the Board on the merits of the application. Otherwise, Board decisions are subject to ordinary judicial review.\n26. If the appellant proceeds with his appeal without legal aid and the court considers that, prima facie, he may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that he should have legal representation in arguing these grounds, then the court must immediately adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the Board\u2019s decision be reviewed.\n27. The practice of the court in this regard was formalised following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Granger v. the United Kingdom of 28 March 1990 (Series A no. 174) by a Practice Note to this effect issued on 4 December 1990 by the Lord Justice General to all Appeal Court Chairmen and Clerks:\n\u201cIn any appeal where legal aid has been refused and the court considers that prima facie an appellant may have substantial grounds for taking the appeal and it is in the interests of justice that the appellant should have legal representation in arguing his grounds, the court shall forthwith adjourn the hearing and make a recommendation that the decision to refuse legal aid should be reviewed.\u201c\n28. Where such a recommendation is made, legal aid is automatically granted. To this end, the Manual of Procedure of the Scottish Legal Aid Board provides in paragraph 6.12 that:\n\u201cIn these circumstances the Board will receive a letter from the High Court of Justiciary giving the details of the case where they are recommending a re-consideration of the decision to refuse. If we are asked to re-consider a decision in these circumstances, then the application should be granted automatically. The case need not be seen by a reporter or Board solicitor, but ought to be referred to the Assistant Manager for the appropriate action.\u201c\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\n29. Mr Maxwell lodged his application (no. 18949/91) with the Commission on 25 March 1991. He relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (c) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, alleging that he had been refused legal aid. He also complained of the conduct of his defence by his legal representatives and of a number of other matters arising out of his trial. The applicant made further submissions under Article 13 (art. 13).\n30. On 2 April 1992, the Commission found all the complaints inadmissible with the exception of the first one which was declared admissible on 9 December 1992. In its report of 4 May 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, by seventeen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c).\nThe full text of the Commission\u2019s opinion and of the dissenting opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\uf02a.\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\n31. At the hearing on 18 April 1993, the Government requested the Court to hold that there had been no violation of the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 6 (art. 6).\nAS TO THE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) OF THE CONVENTION\n32. The applicant who had been sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment complained that he had been refused legal aid for his appeal against conviction in breach of Article 6 para. 3 (c) (art. 6-3-c) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require;\n... \u201c\nThis contention was accepted by the Commission but disputed by the Government.\n33. Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3-c) attaches two conditions to an accused\u2019s right to receive legal aid. The first, \u201clack of sufficient means to pay for legal assistance\u201c, is not in dispute in the present case. The only issue before the Court is therefore whether the \u201cinterests of justice\u201c required that the applicant be granted such assistance free.\n34. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the manner in which paragraph 3 (c) of Article 6 (art. 6-3-c) is to be applied in relation to appellate or cassation courts depends upon the special features of the proceedings involved; account must be taken of the entirety of the proceedings conducted in the domestic legal order and of the role of the appellate or cassation court therein (see, inter alia, the Monnell and Morris v. the United Kingdom judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 115, p. 22, para. 56).\n35. The Scottish system of criminal appeals grants all persons a right to appeal. No special leave is required (see paragraph 16 above). The High Court of Justiciary, in its appellate function, has wide powers to dispose of appeals (see paragraph 19 above). The procedure is not limited to specific grounds; any alleged miscarriage of justice may be challenged (see paragraph 17 above). Moreover, the proceedings always involve an oral hearing at which the Crown is represented (see paragraph 18 above).\nHowever, not all appellants who qualify on financial grounds obtain legal assistance.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n29. The applicants complained that the length of the compensation proceedings exceeded the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides:\n\u201c 1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations..., everyone is entitled to a...hearing within a reasonable time by [a] tribunal established by law...\u201d\n30. The Court notes that the period to be taken into consideration in determining whether the proceedings satisfied the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement laid down by Article 6 \u00a7 1 began on 16 February 1994 when the applicants filed their action with the Izmir Administrative Court, and ended on 28 October 1998 when the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. The period under consideration thus lasted four years and eight months before two instances.\n31. The Government submitted that the case was complicated as it raised a number of medical issues which needed to be clarified by medical experts. They contended that there was no delay attributable either to the administrative or judicial authorities.\n32. The applicants claimed that the case was not complex since it concerned the determination of a compensation claim. It was noteworthy in this connection that the administrative court required only one hearing and one expert opinion to reach its decision. Moreover, the nature of the case demanded that the proceedings be conducted expeditiously.\n33. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many others, Sekin and Others v. Turkey, no. 26518/95, \u00a7 35, 22 January 2004, and Kranz v. Poland, no. 6214/02, \u00a7 33, 17 February 2004).\n34. The Court considers that the case could be considered somewhat complex as it concerned allegations of medical malpractice. However, it also observes that the first-instance court only required one expert opinion to reach its decision and only needed to hold one hearing. For that reason, it is not convinced that the length of the proceedings can be explained by the complexity of the case alone.\n35.

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n16. The relevant domestic law at the material time may be found in Incal v. Turkey, judgment of 9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-IV; \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VII; \u00d6zel v. Turkey, no. 42739/98, 7 November 2002, and Gen\u00e7el v. Turkey, no. 53431/99, 23 October 2003.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal on account of the presence of the military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court which tried and convicted him. He invoked Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention which, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\u201d\n18. The Government replied that the rules then in force governing the appointment of military judges to the State Security Courts and the guarantees which they enjoyed in the performance of their judicial functions on the bench were such as to ensure that these courts fully complied with the requirements of independence and impartiality within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n19. The Court notes that it has examined similar grievances in the past and has found a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 (see, among many other authorities, \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir v. Turkey, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 6 February 2003). It sees no reason to reach a different conclusion in the instant case. It is reasonable that the applicant who was prosecuted in a State Security Court for having been involved in an illegal organisation should have been apprehensive about being tried by a bench which included a regular army officer and member of the Military Legal Service. On that account, he could legitimately fear that the Ankara State Security Court might allow itself to be unduly influenced by considerations which had nothing to do with the nature of the case. In other words, the applicant\u2019s fears as to the State Security Court\u2019s lack of independence and impartiality can be regarded as objectively justified (see Incal, cited above, p. 1573, \u00a7 72 in fine).\n20. Accordingly, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1.\n### II. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n#### A.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 12 October 1999 and 30 May 2000,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that last-mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\nInterception of correspondence\n24. Section 371 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Where a bankruptcy order has been made, the court may from time to time, on the application of the official receiver or the trustee of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, order the Post Office to re-direct and send or deliver to the official receiver or trustee or otherwise any postal packet (within the meaning of the Post Office Act 1953) which would otherwise be sent or delivered by them to the bankrupt at such place or places as may be specified in the order.\n2. An order under this section has effect for such period, not exceeding three months, as may be specified in the order.\u201d\n25. Trustees in Bankruptcy have other statutory powers, which are more stringent than the power to apply for a re-direction order but which may nonetheless need to be used, in appropriate cases, if Trustees are properly to investigate the bankrupt\u2019s affairs for the ultimate benefit of his creditors. In particular, under section 365 of the Insolvency Act 1986 a Trustee may obtain a warrant authorising him to seize property, books and/or records falling into the debtor\u2019s estate. Furthermore, section 366 of the Act allows the court (on application by a Trustee) to summon a variety of persons before it to give an affidavit and/or produce documents.\n26. A bankrupt owes a statutory duty, pursuant to section 333 of the Insolvency Act 1986, to give to the Trustee such information as to his affairs, attend meetings with the Trustee and do such other things as the Trustee may reasonably require for the carrying out of his relevant functions.\nTHE LAW\n### I. alleged violation of article 8 of the convention\n27. The applicant complained that his correspondence, including correspondence with his legal advisers, was intercepted over the period 27 September 1996 to 18 January 1997 by the Post Office on behalf of the Trustee in Bankruptcy. The applicant invoked Article 8 of the Convention, which provides, as relevant:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to respect for ... his correspondence.\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\u201d\n28. The applicant further contended that the failure of the relevant legislation and the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 to protect his correspondence with the European Commission on Human Rights and with the lawyers advising him on his application to that institution must also be considered an inference with the exercise of his right of individual petition under Article 34 of the Convention.\n##### 1. Whether there was an interference\n29. The Government did not dispute that there was an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his correspondence as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention. However, in their submission the impugned interference found its justification in application of the provisions of paragraph 2 of that Article.\n30. The Court observes that the following letters were among the correspondence re-directed to the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy before the expiry of the Order of 27 September 1996 (see paragraph 19 above): two letters from the Legal Aid Board, two letters from the Legal Department of the applicant\u2019s representative organisation, a letter from the Police Complaints Authority and a letter from the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence Police. Each of these letters was copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant. Furthermore, there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 when the Order had expired. One delivery was received on 30 December 1996, the other on 10 January 1997. A number of items in these deliveries were read and copied to file before being forwarded to the applicant (see paragraph 22 above).\nFor the Court, the measures applied to the applicant\u2019s correspondence were an \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d, within the meaning of Article 8 \u00a7 2, with the exercise of the right guaranteed to the applicant under paragraph 1 of the provision. Indeed, the Government have not sought to argue to the contrary.\n##### 2. Justification for the interference\n31. Such interference breaches Article 8 unless it is \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, pursues one or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph 2 and is, in addition, \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d to achieve those aims.\n(a) Whether the interference was \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d\n32. The applicant contended that the Insolvency Act 1986 (\u201cthe 1986 Act\u201d) did not define with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of the exercise of discretion to re-direct and intercept mail. He observed in this connection that neither the 1986 Act nor the re-direction Order of 26 September 1996 made any provision for dealing with legally privileged materials. The applicant further stressed that his correspondence continued to be re-directed after the date of expiry of the Order and was read and copied to file. Moreover, Ms S.D. was both the Trustee in Bankruptcy and the Receiver, and in the former capacity had access to, read, copied and retained legally privileged communications concerning his challenge to the enforcement of the confiscation Order. For these reasons, the applicant maintained that the measures applied to his correspondence could not be considered to satisfy the requirement at issue.\n33. The Government disagreed. They stated that the impeached measure was in accordance with the clear terms of the Order which the Trustee in Bankruptcy obtained from the court under section 371 of the 1986 Act. Although there were two mail deliveries to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after the Order had expired on 27 December 1996, neither fell into the category of correspondence covered by legal professional privilege (see paragraph 20 above). Moreover, the fact that these letters were re-directed after the expiry of the Order was explained by the delay in implementing the procedures for discontinuing the re-direction of letters.\n34. The Court recalls that the expression \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d implies conditions which go beyond the existence of a legal basis in domestic law and requires that the legal basis be \u201caccessible\u201d and \u201cforeseeable\u201d (see the Amann v. Switzerland judgment of 16 February 2000, to be published in the Court\u2019s official reports, \u00a7 56). Having regard to the terms of both section 371 of the 1986 Act and the re-direction Order (see paragraphs 24 and 16 above), the Court accepts that there was a legal basis for the interception of the applicant\u2019s correspondence up until 27 December 1996 and its perusal and copying to file by the Trustee in Bankruptcy. It further accepts that the Trustee in Bankruptcy\u2019s discretion to open, read and make copies of the applicant\u2019s correspondence was not open-ended but confined to particular items which might assist her in her capacity of Trustee in locating and securing the applicant\u2019s assets for the benefit of his creditors. It is to be noted that the applicant was at the material time a bankrupt. That his Trustee in Bankruptcy might have resort to the measure at issue must have been foreseeable, all the more since the applicant was legally represented in the bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn the Court\u2019s opinion, the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence between 27 September 1996 and 27 December 1996 satisfied the qualitative conditions inherent in the \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d requirement.\n35. However, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the interference with the applicant\u2019s correspondence continued after the expiry of the Order. The Government do not dispute the fact that two mail deliveries were re-directed by the Post Office to the Trustee in Bankruptcy after the expiry date. It is to be noted that, regardless of the alleged breakdown in the administrative arrangements for re-directing the applicant\u2019s correspondence relied on by the Government, it nevertheless remains the case that the Trustee in Bankruptcy exercised her discretion to open letters and to retain copies of some of them. In the view of the Court, the Trustee in Bankruptcy must be taken to have known that the re-direction Order which she herself applied for and obtained no longer provided her with a legal basis to interfere with the applicant\u2019s correspondence. On that account, the actions of the Trustee in Bankruptcy after 27 December 1996 were not in accordance with the law. For that reason, there has been a breach of Article 8 of the Convention and the Court does not consider it necessary to examine with respect to these particular items of correspondence whether the other conditions of paragraph 2 of that Article were complied with.\n(b) Whether the interference before the expiry of the re-direction Order pursued a legitimate aim\n36. The applicant did not contest the Government\u2019s view that the measures directed against his correspondence during the validity of the re-direction Order were intended to protect the rights of his creditors.\n37. The Court observes that the Trustee in Bankruptcy sought and was granted the re-direction Order to enable her to identify and secure the assets of the applicant, a bankrupt, with a view to their distribution to his creditors. Authorising the Trustee in Bankruptcy to have access to the applicant\u2019s correspondence during the period covered by the Order can be considered to be in furtherance of the protection of the \u201crights of others\u201d within the meaning Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention. The Court concludes therefore that the interference pursued a legitimate aim.\n(c) Whether the interference before the expiry of the re-direction Order was \u201cnecessary in a democratic society\u201d\n38. The applicant highlighted what he considered to be the unacceptable scope of the powers granted to the Trustee in Bankruptcy, in particular to have access to correspondence with his legal advisers, photocopy such correspondence and retain a copy of it. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the re-direction Order could have excluded the re-direction of clearly marked legally privileged materials without impairing the aim of the Order. The applicant stressed in this respect that the Government did not contradict his argument that the envelopes containing correspondence with his representative organisation in the Convention proceedings, Liberty, were clearly identified on the outside.\n39. The applicant drew attention to the fact that, in addition to his correspondence with Liberty, the Trustee in Bankruptcy also copied and retained five letters passing between the applicant and S.K. who was acting on his behalf as an insolvency consultant and legal adviser in the domestic proceedings involving the Receiver. The applicant maintained that Ms S.D., as Trustee in Bankruptcy, must have been aware that she was the opponent of S.K. in the domestic litigation. For her to open, read, copy and retain S.K.\u2019s correspondence with the applicant amounted to a serious invasion ", "001-81110": "\ufeff\nTHIRD SECTION\nCASE OF HASAN ERKAN v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n14. The applicant complained that the length of the proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d.\n15. The Government contested that argument and submitted that in the course of the proceedings, the Administrative Court and the Council of State had each rendered two decisions. The case had been a complex one and numerous hearings were held in the course of these proceedings. There were no delays which could be attributable to the national authorities.\n#### A. Admissibility\n16. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n17. The Court observes that the proceedings began on 17 January 1993 when the applicant filed an action before the Ankara Administrative Court, and ended on 15 November 2002 when the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers upheld the first-instance court's judgment. The proceedings thus lasted nine years and ten months during which four decisions have been rendered. In this connection the Court would point out that it took the Council of State almost two years and nine months to render its decision. Furthermore, the Joint Council of the Council of State's Administrative Chambers did not decide on the appeal for a period of almost two and a half years. These delays contributed substantially to the total length of the proceedings.\n18. The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the following criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\n19. The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n20.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n20. The applicant complained that the length of the first set of proceedings had been incompatible with the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement, laid down in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n21. The Government contested that argument.\n22. The period to be taken into consideration began on 7 February 1992 and ended on 30 May 2002. It thus lasted approximately ten years and three months before two levels of jurisdiction.\n#### A. Admissibility\n23.

The Court has frequently found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case (see Frydlender, cited above).\n26. Having examined all the material submitted to it, the Court considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case. Having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the instant case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement.\nThere has accordingly been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on this ground.\n### II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION\n27. The applicant further complained under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No.1 that the awards made by the Ankara Administrative Court in respect of compensation and his lawyer's costs and expenses were insufficient and disproportionate.

Relying on Article 6 \u00a7 3 (c) of the Convention, the applicant complained that, although he was a minor at the time, he had been denied the assistance of a lawyer during his police custody.\n13. The Government maintained in the first place that the applicant had not exhausted domestic remedies, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, since at no stage of the domestic proceedings did he rely on the fact that he had been deprived of his right to legal assistance during police custody. In the alternative, they stated that the application was introduced outside the six months time-limit, since the applicant was represented by a lawyer during his trial after 3 September 2001. In the alternative, relying on the Court\u2019s case-law in the Okul v. Turkey decision (no. 45358/99, 4 September 2003), they considered that the six months time-limit should run from 8 July 2002, the date on which the Court of Cassation delivered its decision.\n14. The Court notes that the restriction imposed on the applicant\u2019s right of access to a lawyer was systemic, pursuant to section 31 of Law no. 3842, and applied to anyone held in police custody in connection with an offence falling within the jurisdiction of the State Security Courts. As a result, this restriction was applied as a blanket rule and the applicant could not request the benefit of legal assistance during his police custody. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection regarding exhaustion of domestic remedies. As to the Government\u2019s contention that the applicant failed to comply with the six months time-limit, the Court recalls that, in assessing whether or not a trial was fair, regard should be had to the entirety of the proceedings (see John Murray v. the United Kingdom, 8 February 1996, \u00a7 63, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011I). Furthermore, in the Okul decision, referred to by the Government, the Court had referred to Article 324 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that, if the Court of Cassation holds a hearing, it should deliver its decision within one week following that hearing. However, in the present case, the Court of Cassation did not hold a hearing on the merits of the case.\n15. The Court reiterates that where an applicant is not entitled to be served ex officio with a written copy of the final domestic decision and if she or he was represented by a lawyer during the domestic proceedings, as in the present case, the date on which the final domestic decision was deposited with the registry of the first-instance court should be taken as the starting-point under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, being the latest date by which the applicant or his or her representative was definitively able to find out about the content of the final decision (see \u0130pek v. Turkey (dec.), no. 39706/98, 7 November 2000). In the present case, the decision dated 8 July 2002 was deposited with the Registry of the Adana State Security Court on 21 August 2002. As the applicant lodged his application with the Court on 4 February 2002, the Court considers that he has lodged his application with the Court within the six month time-limit, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Consequently, the Government\u2019s objection cannot be upheld.\n16. At this point, the Court observes that, after the introduction of the present application with the Court, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were reopened following several amendments in the national legislation. At the end of the trial, the domestic courts found the applicant guilty under Article 215 of Law no. 5326, but deferred sentencing. As a result, the applicant was placed under supervision for a period of five years and the conviction was not noted in his criminal record. However, before this decision, the applicant had already been serving his prison sentence between 11 September 2002 and 15 September 2003.

A full description of the domestic law may be found in \u00d6zel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21, 7 November 2002).\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n17. The applicant complained in the first place that he had not received a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal due to the presence of a military judge on the bench of the Ankara State Security Court. The applicant further maintained that the principle of equality of arms had been violated since he had not been notified of the public prosecutor\u2019s observations at the appeal stage. In this connection, he invoked Article 6 of the Convention, which in so far as relevant reads as follows:\n\u201c1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n...\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n18. The Government argued under Article 35 of the Convention that the applicant\u2019s complaint in respect of the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. They maintained that the applicant had not invoked this complaint before the domestic courts. In this respect, they referred to the case-law of the Court (in particular Ahmet Sad\u0131k v. Greece, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996\u2011V).\n19. The Court reiterates that it has already examined similar preliminary objections of the Government in respect of the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies (see Vural v. Turkey, no. 56007/00, \u00a7 22, 21 December 2004, \u00c7olak v. Turkey (no. 1), no. 52898/99, \u00a7 24, 15 July 2004, and \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7 25). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require it to depart from its findings in the above-mentioned cases.\n20. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objection.\n21. In the light of its established case-law (see amongst many authorities, \u00c7\u0131raklar v. Turkey, judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VII), and in view of the materials submitted to it, the Court considers that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. The Court therefore concludes that the remainder of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. As to the independence and impartiality of the Ankara State Security Court\n22. The Government maintained that the State Security Courts had been established by law to deal with threats to the security and integrity of the State. They submitted that in the instant case there was no basis to find that the applicant could have any legitimate doubts about the independence of the Ankara State Security Court. The Government further referred to the constitutional amendment of 1999 whereby military judges could no longer sit on such courts. Finally, they stated that the State Security Courts had been abolished as of 2004.\n23. The Court notes that it has examined similar cases in the past and has concluded that there was a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see \u00d6zel, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 33-34, and \u00d6zdemir, no. 59659/00, \u00a7\u00a7 35-36, 6 February 2003).\n24.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n15. The applicant complained under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty as there had been no reasonable suspicion for his arrest. Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) provides as follows:\n\u201c1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\n...\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so...\u201d\n16. The Government did not comment on this complaint.\n17. The Court reiterates that having a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned might have committed the offence (Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, \u00a7 32). However, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at a later stage of the process of criminal investigation (Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 27 \u00a7 55).\n18. The Court observes that the applicant was arrested during the course of a police operation carried out against the PKK. According to the arrest protocol, which was signed by the applicant, a search warrant had been issued against him and the applicant had attempted to escape when the police officers asked him to show his identity card.\n19. The Court considers that the aforementioned elements are sufficient to support the conclusion that there was \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the applicant\u2019s arrest. The fact that the proceedings against him were subsequently suspended does not of itself call into question the existence of a reasonable suspicion within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c).\n20. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n### II. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 AND 4 OF THE CONVENTION\n21. The applicant complained that he had been held in police custody for seven days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power. He further complained under Article 13 of the Convention that he had no remedy in domestic law to challenge the lawfulness of his detention in police custody.\nThe Court considers that the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 13 should be examined from the standpoint of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. Article 5 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention read as follows:\n\u201c3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\u201d\n#### A. Admissibility\n22. The Government submitted that the application should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. They argued that the applicant had failed to invoke Article 5 of the Convention before the domestic authorities and to challenge the decision to extend his custody period. The Government further maintained that the applicant could have sought compensation under Law no. 466 on the Payment of Compensation to Persons Unlawfully Arrested or Detained.\n23. The Court notes that it has already examined and rejected the Government\u2019s preliminary objections in similar cases (see, for example, \u00d6calan v. Turkey [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 66-71, ECHR 2005\u2011... and Da\u015f, cited above, \u00a7 18). The Court finds no particular circumstances in the instant case, which would require it to depart from this jurisprudence.\n24. Consequently, the Court rejects the Government\u2019s preliminary objections.\n25. The Court notes that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\n#### B. Merits\n##### 1. The applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention\n26. The Government argued that the length of the applicant\u2019s detention in police custody was in conformity with the legislation in force at the material time. They further maintained that the relevant domestic law had been amended in accordance with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n27. The applicant reiterated his allegations.\n28. The Court has already accepted on a number of occasions that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems (see Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, pp. 33-34, \u00a7 61; Murray, cited above, \u00a7 58; Demir and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, p. 2653, \u00a7 41). This does not mean, however, that the authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects and detain them in police custody, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, in the final instance, by the Convention\u2019s supervisory institutions, whenever they consider that there has been a terrorist offence (see, among others, Murray, cited above, \u00a7 58).\n29. The Court notes that the applicant was taken into police cu", "001-79392": "\ufeff\nSECOND SECTION\nCASE OF EVALDSSON AND OTHERS v.

Doll\u00e9, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 June 2006 and 16 January 2007,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last\u2011mentioned date: ### II. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n#### A. Freedom of association\n16. Freedom of association is guaranteed in the Swedish constitution. Chapter 2, section 1 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) provides in its relevant parts:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is guaranteed:\n1. freedom of expression: the freedom to communicate information and to express ideas, opinions and emotions whether orally, in writing, in pictorial representations or in any other way; ...\n5. freedom of association: the freedom to unite with others for public or private purposes; ...\u201d\nChapter 2, section 2 protects, inter alia, the negative aspect of freedom of association. It reads:\n\u201cIn relation to the public administration, every citizen is protected against coercion to divulge an opinion in a political, religious, cultural or other such connection. In relation to the public administration, he is furthermore protected against coercion to participate in a meeting for the formation of opinion or in a demonstration or other manifestation of opinion, or to belong to a political association, religious congregation or other association for opinions referred to in the first sentence.\u201d\n17. Section 7 of the 1976 Act on Co-Determination at Work (Lag om medbest\u00e4mmande i arbetslivet, SFS 1976:580, hereinafter \u201cthe 1976 Act\u201d) guarantees the right of employers and employees to form, belong to and work for labour market organisations. The right of association is further protected by section 8, which forbids any recourse to action against someone on the opposing side for having exercised this right or in order not to exercise it.\n#### B. The relationship between employers and employees\n18. Section 10 of the 1976 Act gives employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 organisations as well as individual employers a right of negotiation in regard to matters concerning the relationship between employers and employees. It does not provide for any right of negotiation for the individual employees, who are obliged to exercise their powers through the trade unions.\n19. Under section 26 of the 1976 Act, a collective labour agreement is binding not only on the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s organisations but also on their members, i.e. companies and individual workers. Moreover, in practice, the collective agreement is also of significance for employees who are not trade union members in that it has a normative effect. This entails that the individual work contracts are considered to have the same contents as the collective agreement unless the parties to the contract have expressly agreed otherwise.\n20. Under section 27 of the 1976 Act, an employer and an employee cannot conclude a legally valid agreement which contradicts the collective agreement by which they are bound. This means that an agreement contradicting the collective agreement is automatically null and void. While contracts with less favourable conditions than the collective agreement are normally invalid, the validity of contracts with more favourable conditions depends on an interpretation of the agreement in question. As the instant provision formally only prohibits an employer from concluding contradictory contracts with members of the trade union which is party to the collective agreement, it is possible for the employer to conclude such contracts with employees who are not members of the relevant trade union. However, most collective agreements are based on the presumption that an employer does not have a right to conclude such contracts with non-member workers. Consequently, while the contracts in question remain valid, the employer may be liable to pay damages to the trade union.\n#### C. The monitoring system\n21. Monitoring of wages for hourly work is conducted in a manner determined by the employer and the local union branch. It normally involves the examination of documents provided by the employer and personal visits by the union\u2019s representatives to the employer. If a mistake is discovered, clarifications or corrections can be made by telephone or letter. In some cases, formal negotiations are required.\n22. Under the terms of the Construction Agreement, the local union branch is entitled to a fee as compensation for the costs entailed by the monitoring work. The fee \u2013 1.5% of the employee\u2019s wages \u2013 is deducted by the employer from the wages of each individual worker.\n23. According to the applicants, a member of the Union pays about 3,500 Swedish kronor (SEK)0 per year in monitoring fees in addition to the union membership fee of SEK 3,000. The largest competing trade union, the Syndicalist union, does not have a monitoring system. The Union therefore has a de facto monopoly in this field.\n24. The regulation regarding the monitoring of wages was incorporated in the 1976 Construction Agreement. Previously, workers paid time-based wages had not been subjected to deductions for monitoring fees. According to the applicants, the purpose was that workers paid time-based wages, as an act of solidarity with workers carrying out piecework, should contribute to the whole inspection system. At the material time, the majority of the workers performed piecework, the measurement of which was costly and time-consuming. The fee for monitoring time-based wages was thus not primarily introduced as reimbursement for the service in question, but as a means of supporting the measurement of piecework wages.\n25. Today, approximately 80% of workers are paid time-based wages, which is almost the opposite ratio compared to the situation in 1976. In general, the monitoring of wages is now computerised and based on information provided by the employer.\n26. According to a statement of 24 May 2006 by Mr Lars-G\u00f6ran Bromander, former division manager at Byggettan, a review of the still existing audit material for 1999 showed that, as a result of the monitoring work, wages had been adjusted upwards for 648 workers, of which 250 were not Union members.\n27. The activities of Byggettan, the local union branch, are divided into two parts: branch activities (inter alia, wage negotiations, union agitation and political work) and business activities (i.e. the inspection work, comprised of the monitoring of time-based wages and the measurement of piecework). Branch or non-profit activities are to be paid for by means of union membership fees. Revenue from the business activities, which is subject to value-added tax, should cover the costs of such activities.\n#### D. Figures concerning monitoring and measuring work\n28. The parties have submitted various documents to the Court containing information on the revenue and cost of the activities of the Building Workers\u2019 Union and the Byggettan branch. The following information has been compiled from these documents.\n##### 1. The annual reports of Byggettan\n29. According to the annual report for 1998, Byggettan had 94 permanent employees (54 officials and 40 administrative personnel) on 31 December 1998. Before the Labour Court, the Building Workers\u2019 Union stated that the number of persons involved in inspection work (monitoring and measuring) during the period relevant to the present case, March \u2013 July 1999, was the same as at the end of 1998, and that the 1998 annual report named 21 officials who had been occupied with this activity. However, the annual report only mentions, in addition to the head of the relevant department, 12 officials who were dealing with such work, one of whom had been doing so only until 26 March 1998. It thus appears that, during the relevant period, 12-13 officials were involved in inspection work, i.e. about 22-24% of the total number of officials. Incidentally, the annual report for 1999 indicates that, at the end of 1999, the total workforce of Byggettan remained the same.\n30. Byggettan\u2019s annual reports for 1997-2000 contain statements of accounts where its business activities, i.e. the inspection work, are separated from its branch activities. According to the statement of accounts for 1999, Byggettan\u2019s branch activities showed a loss of SEK 10.3 million, whereas the inspection work recorded a profit of SEK 5 million. The total revenue from the inspection work amounted to SEK 30.9 million, the operational and administrative costs of this sector of activity were SEK 25.2 million and the write-offs of movables came to SEK 0.7 million. Whereas it is shown, in a footnote to the statement of accounts, that, of the revenue from the inspection work, SEK 21.6 million derived from monitoring fees, there is no such differentiation as regards the costs.\nHowever, in another footnote, information is provided on Byggettan\u2019s costs, which are given separately for the branch activities and the inspection work. The total costs for wages and remunerations in 1999 amounted to SEK 25.5 million, of which SEK 12.5 million (i.e. about 49%) were attributed to the inspection work. The total amount of pension payments was SEK 6.9 million, of which SEK 6.346 million (or about 92%) were a burden on the latter activities. The remaining costs, including offices, travels, administration and social contributions, totalled SEK 28 million, of which SEK 12.7 million (about 45%) were attributed to the inspection work.\n31. In submissions by the Building Workers\u2019 Union to the Labour Court and by the Government in the present proceedings, it has been claimed that the result of the inspection work has to be corrected to the extent that a reimbursement was received from the pension fund of the Building Workers\u2019 Union. In the statement of accounts for 1999, a reimbursement of SEK 6.360 million was recorded for the inspection work. As this reimbursement in effect reduced the costs, the amount has to be deducted from the recorded profit of SEK 5 million in order to arrive at the real financial result of the inspection work. Thus, in the Government\u2019s view, the pension payments should be recorded as a cost, whereas the pension fund reimbursement should not be considered as revenue. Consequently, in 1999, that sector of activity was actually run at a loss of more than SEK 1.3 million.\nThe applicants, however, disagree with the above calculation. They have stated that, throughout the years, the branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union have made contributions to the pension fund, whose accumulated assets are used to honour the Union\u2019s pension commitments towards its retired personnel. Thus, when making pension payments, the Union branches are not the actual payer but are making the payments on behalf of the pension fund, presumably because the fund does not have an administrative division of its own to handle such payments. Accordingly, the applicants claim that, when determining the actual annual result of the inspection work, the pension transactions should only be taken into account to the extent that the fund reimbursements differ from the pension payments. In 1999, the reimbursement received by Byggettan exceeded the pension payments by as little as SEK 14,000. The financial result of that year should thus be reduced by only that amount and the recorded profit of SEK 5 million consequently remains virtually unchanged.\nIn the statements of accounts of the Building Workers Union\u2019s Gothenburg branch for the years 1997-2000, pension fund reimbursements have been recorded as revenue and pension payments as costs. Consequently, only the differences between reimbursements and payments have affected the annual results.\n32. The statements of accounts in the annual reports of Byggettan for 1997, 1998 and 2000 contain figures which give a picture similar to 1999. In 1997, the revenue from the inspection work was SEK 27.9 million (of which the monitoring fees came to SEK 17.3 million) and the recorded profit of that sector of activity amounted to SEK 3.4 million. Byggettan received a pension fund reimbursement of more than SEK 8.3 million. If the result is corrected with this amount, in the manner claimed by the Government, the profit would turn into a loss of SEK 4.9 million. However, the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 1.7 million. If pension transactions were altogether excluded from the calculation, as effectively suggested by the applicants, the profit would be halved and amount to SEK 1.7 million. 45% of the wage costs, 92% of the pension payments and 42% of the other costs of that year were attributed to the inspection work.\n33. In 1998, the inspection work revenue was SEK 28.8 million (of which the monitoring fees amounted to SEK 19.8 million) and the recorded profit was SEK 3.5 million. A pension fund reimbursement of SEK 6.8 million was received which, if allowed to correct the result in full, would change the latter into a loss of SEK 3.3 million. However, as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 14,000, the profit would remain at SEK 3.5 million if pension transactions were not taken into account. 46% of the wage costs, 93% of the pension payments and 44% of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work.\n34. In 2000, the inspection work revenue was SEK 37 million (of which the monitoring fees came to SEK 27.2 million) and the recorded profit was SEK 8.5 million. A pension fund reimbursement of SEK 6.4 million was received which, if correcting the result, would reduce the profit to SEK 2.1 million. However, as the reimbursement exceeded the pension payments by only SEK 315,000, the profit would be SEK 8.2 million if pension transactions were not taken into account. 53% of the wage costs, 93% of the pension payments and 51% of the other costs were attributed to the inspection work.\n##### 2. The annual budgets of Byggettan\n35. The budgets for 1998 and 2000-2003 have been made available to the Court by the parties.\n36. In its budget for 1998, Byggettan estimated that the monitoring work would cost SEK 3.9 million and that the direct costs of the inspection unit (dealing with both monitoring of time-based wages and measuring of piecework) would amount to SEK 12 million. The projected revenue from the inspection work was SEK 29 million. It thus appears that the costs of the monitoring work accounted for about one-third of the inspection costs. However, as can be seen from the above-mentioned figures presented in the annual report for 1998 (see paragraph 33 above), the monitoring fees\u2019 share of the inspection revenue came to more than two-thirds (SEK 19.8 million out of a recorded total of SEK 28.8 million). That share was approximately the same in 1997, 1999 and 2000.\n37. The budgets for 2000-2003 give the estimated total costs of the various units of Byggettan. In 2000, the total projected costs of all sectors of activity were SEK 69.4 million. The monitoring unit had a budget of SEK 6.1. million and the wages and contracts unit (the largest unit of Byggettan, which, according to the description in the budget, was dealing with, inter alia, the measurement of piecework, wage negotiations and matters concerning workers\u2019 co-determination, the work environment and safety) had a budget of SEK 18.1 million. It is not possible to discern, from the material available to the Court, how much of the latter unit\u2019s budgeted costs related to the measuring work. Furthermore, as an unknown portion of Byggettan\u2019s general administrative costs would presumably have to be attributed to monitoring and measuring, the total budgeted costs for the two types of inspection work cannot be established.\nHowever, the costs of the inspection work according to the official results for 2000 appear to be considerably higher than the budgeted costs for that activity. Thus, the statement of accounts for that year attributes SEK 28.5 million in operational and administrative costs and write-offs to the inspection work, which corresponds to about 52% of the grand total of SEK 54.8 million. If, as claimed by the Government, an amount corresponding to that year\u2019s pension fund reimbursement is to be added as an actual cost, the official costs attributed to the inspection work rise to 57% of the total costs.\n38. In the budget for 2001, the projected total costs of Byggettan were SEK 73.5 million, while those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages and contracts unit were SEK 6.3 million and 19.6 million, respectively. The 2002 budget estimated the total costs at SEK 73.1 million. Both the monitoring unit and the new wages unit (responsible, inter alia, for measuring work) had a budget of SEK 7.2 million. In 2003, the budgeted total costs were SEK 77.8 million and those pertaining to the monitoring unit and the wages unit were SEK 7.1 million and 8.6 million, respectively.\n3. The financial results of inspection work performed by all branches of the Building Workers\u2019 Union in the years 2001-2005\n39. A chart compiled by Mr Leif Hjelm, Deputy Head of Finance at the Union, and submitted to the Court by the Government, contains the results of the monitoring and measuring activities of all 34 branches of the Union. According to the chart, Byggettan recorded a positive result in four out of the five years presented and had an accumulated profit of SEK 36.2 million during the period. If corrected with the reimbursements received from the pension fund, the accumulated profit would amount to SEK 21.8 million. However, the chart shows a negative overall result for 26 of the branches. As a consequence, the accumulated five-year result of the inspection work of all the branches of the Union was a loss of SEK 5 million, or \u2013 if the result is corrected with the contributions made by the branches to the pension fund and the reimbursements received from that fund during the period \u2013 a loss of SEK 58 million.\nIt should be noted that the chart in question does not provide any information on the actual pension payments made by the Union branches, nor how the annual costs had been assigned between the inspection work and the branches\u2019 other activities. The statements of accounts of the Gothenburg branch for the years 1997-2000 show, however, that that branch allocated the costs in much the same way as Byggettan.\n##### 4. Statement by Mr Rolf Andersson, treasurer at Byggettan\n40. In a statement of 23 February 2005, made in regard to the present case and submitted to the Court by the Government, Mr Rolf Andersson gave the following information on the monitoring activities of Byggettan in 1999. A total of about SEK 9.4 million was deducted from the wages of workers working for employers bound by the Construction Agreement. The total costs of the monitoring work were approximately SEK 16.4 million. A large part of the costs was financed by the employers themselves and not by means of deductions from workers\u2019 wages.\n##### 5. Statement by Mr Hans Tilly, president of the Building Workers\u2019 Union\n41. In the Union\u2019s periodical, Byggnadsarbetaren, issue no. 8/2006 (published on 18 May 2006), Mr Hans Tilly stated that the Union had a relatively low membership fee compared to other major trade unions because the monitoring and measuring fees bore the cost of the organisation of negotiations.\nTHE LAW\n### I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL NO. 1 TO THE CONVENTION\n42. The applicants asserted that the levying of the monitoring fees on their wages had amounted to a violation of their property rights. They relied on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\n\u201cEvery natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\u201d\n#### A. The submissions of the parties\n##### 1. The applicants\n43. The applicants submitted that the situation in the present case was to be examined under the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as the wage deductions involved a deprivation of their property for a service which they had never requested and which, as regards the greater part of the deductions, did not correspond to any service at all. Whichever rule of Article 1 was applicable, there had been an interference with their property rights which lacked a legitimate aim and which, in any event, was not proportionate to any such aim.\n44. As to the proportionality of the alleged interference, the applicants submitted, inter alia, the following. The monitoring fees constituted covert union membership fees. That conclusion followed already from the judgment of the Labour Court, which had stated that there was no reason to distinguish between monitoring work and general union activities and that the monitoring fees contributed financially to those general activities. Through the payment of those fees, the applicants came to support the Union\u2019s political and ideological programme with which they did not agree. Moreover, the monitoring system was unique to the Building Workers\u2019 Union and could not be seen as an indispensable tool for the proper functioning of the Union on the labour market. In balancing the interests involved, the applicants\u2019 interests thus weighed more heavily. Further, in so far as the monitoring work generated a surplus, a legitimate union interest was lacking altogether and a balancing exercise was irrelevant.\n45. Referring to the documents submitted to the Court, including the annual reports and budgets of Byggettan, the applicants claimed that the monitoring work generated a substantial annual surplus. This could be seen already from the official results in the annual reports. The Union\u2019s and the Government\u2019s claim, that the actual results were negative as amounts corresponding to the pension fund reimbursements had to be added to the costs for each year, was repudiated by the applicants; only the difference between reimbursements and actual pension payments affected the results, which thus remained positive. The applicants also questioned the allocation of costs made by Byggettan and other branches of the Union; despite the fact that only a small number of employees were involved in monitoring and measuring work \u2013 the majority of staff being occupied with branch activities \u2013 more than 90% of the pension payments and about half of the wage costs were allocated to the monitoring and measuring work. It was the applicants\u2019 opinion that this had been done because of the fact that the costs of wages attributed to the business activities were tax deductible. They also pointed out that the results forecasted in the budgets were far better than the results recorded in the annual reports and that these \u201cnegative budget deviations\u201d, i.e. miscalculations, continued year after year. In their view, the only possible conclusion was that the budgets more accurately indicated the true profits and that the results recorded in the annual reports were the effect of certain reallocations of costs.\nThe applicants further asserted that their submissions constituted sufficient evidence to conclude that the inspection work, in particular the monitoring activities, generated a surplus far exceeding the profits recorded in the annual reports of Byggettan. In these circumstances, the Government should bear the burden of proof for their claim that the Union\u2019s inspection work was run at a loss. To date, the Government had not presented adequate information allowing a full examination of the Union\u2019s revenue and costs in respect of the inspection work.\n46. As to the Government\u2019s contention that all construction workers benefited from the wage monitoring, the applicants submitted that it was the wish of the Union that collective agreements have strong normative effects and that there was always a risk for the Union that its work, to a greater or lesser extent, benefited non-members. They also maintained that unorganised workers did not receive any help from the Union if a fault was discovered during the wage monitoring. Moreover, while, formally, the Union was entitled to compensation only if monitoring work actually had been carried out, it had never, in practice, declined to receive any monitoring fees.\n47. The applicants finally submitted that it was the system of collective agreements with normative effect, regulated by law, which had made possible the alleged violations of their rights. The Swedish State, therefore, had had a positive obligation to protect their rights in relation to the Union.\n##### 2. The Government\n48. The Government contended that, if Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 was at all applicable, what had occurred in the present case had to be considered as a control of the use of property falling within "}
